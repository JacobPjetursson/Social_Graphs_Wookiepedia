===Fallen Jedi===
{{Quote|Form up now. Your masters are here.''"<br />"''Masters? We have only one master. The Emperor.''"<br />"''Times have changed Eighth Brother.|The Grand Inquisitor and Eighth Brother|Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 6: The Chosen One, Part VI}}
[[File:Inquisitorius Vader Comic.png|thumb|left|250px|The Eighth Brother became a part of the Inquisitorious]]
The individual who became known as the Eighth Brother originally occupied a position within the [[Jedi Order]]. At some point after the [[Galactic Republic]] was reorganized into the [[Galactic Empire]], he was inducted into an Imperial agency of [[The Force|Force-sensitive]] assassins called the [[Inquisitorius]], which was tasked with hunting down and eliminating any [[Jedi]] who survived [[Order 66]]. To accomplish this, he and his [[Brother/Sister|colleagues]] were trained by [[The Grand Inquisitor]] in the [[Inquisitorius Headquarters]] in [[The Works]], but soon fell under the command of [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] when [[Darth Sidious]] first demonstrated the Inquisitorius to Vader, who continued their training in the ways of the [[dark side of the Force]]. The [[Grand Inquisitor]] informed Eighth Brother and his colleagues that they had two masters, Eighth Brother in response proclaimed that they only served Sidious, but was soon countered by the Grand Inquisitor who stated that times had changed.<ref name="Dark Lord 6" />

Eighth Brother celebrated with all the other Inquisitors after Darth Vader, [[Fifth Brother]], a [[Unidentified Twi'lek Inquisitor|Twi'lek Inquisitor]] and a [[Unidentified female Inquisitor|female Inquisitor]] successfully killed [[Eeth Koth]].<ref name="Dark Lord 19">''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 19: Fortress Vader, Part I]]''</ref>

===Age of the Empire===
====Hunting Maul====
Following the Grand Inquisitor's [[Action at Mustafar|death]] at the hands of the Jedi [[Kanan Jarrus]] and his [[padawan]], [[Ezra Bridger]], the Brother and the other Inquisitors saw "new opportunities" to take his place by hunting down the two Jedi and their [[Spectres|crew]] on their [[VCX-100 light freighter|VCX-100]], called the ''[[Ghost]]''. However, while the Fifth Brother and [[Seventh Sister]]<ref name="Always">{{Rebels|Always Two There Are}}</ref> were given the chance to do so when [[Darth]] Vader dispatched them on the [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor's]] orders,<ref name="Siege">''[[Star Wars Rebels: The Siege of Lothal]]''</ref> the Eighth Brother was given the task of hunting down [[Maul]], the former [[Sith]] [[Sith apprentice|apprentice]], whom he knew only as "the Shadow."<ref name="Eighth Brother" />

====Trouble on Malachor====
[[File:The light and the dark.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|The Eighth Brother clashes Ahsoka Tano in concert with his two subordinates clashing with Maul and Kanan Jarrus]]
After eventually [[Mission to Malachor|tracking]] Maul to the [[Malachor Sith Temple|Sith temple]] on [[Malachor]], the Brother unexpectedly found Jarrus, Bridger, and [[Ahsoka Tano]]. After stalking them for a short [[time]], the Eighth Brother attacked the three rebels but was forced to retreat. After the trio was split up, Tano and Jarrus tracked down and captured the Eighth Brother, who was unable to escape due to [[C1-10P|Chopper]] commandeering his [[TIE Advanced v1]]. However, the Eighth Brother managed to send a covert signal, which was answered by the Fifth Brother and Seventh Sister, with all three attacking Tano and Jarrus. However, the tables were turned on them when Bridger arrived with Maul in tow, the pair of them joining Tano and Jarrus and driving the Inquisitors off.<ref name="Twilight of the Apprentice" />

Fearing that Maul had claimed [[Sith holocron (Malachor)|a]] [[Sith holocron]] sought by Darth Vader, the Eighth Brother impulsively set out to hunt down the enemy and reclaim it. He attacked Jarrus and Bridger, knocking out the [[Jedi Knight]] before turning his attention to the apprentice, only to be driven off by Tano and Maul. Teaming up with the Fifth Brother, he then went after Tano and Jarrus while the Seventh Sister went after Bridger and Maul, only for Maul to arrive and [[Death|kill]] the Fifth Brother whilst Jarrus damaged the Eighth Brother's lightsaber. Over-matched and outnumbered, the Eighth Brother attempted to flee using his [[lightsaber]]'s [[Double-bladed spinning lightsaber|spinning blades]] to slow his descent as he leaped from the [[Sith temple|temple]], only for the weapon to fail<ref name="Twilight of the Apprentice" /> and cause him to fall to his death.<ref name="Eighth Brother" />

==Personality and traits==
Like the other Inquisitors, the Eighth Brother was fiercely dedicated to the service of the Empire and Darth Vader. He was aggressive to the point that he often charged into action while his fellows hung back to allow him to weaken the enemy. He was also ruthless and cruel, demonstrating a willingness to drag out the terror of an enemy before killing them. However, his impulsive streak proved to be his undoing, as he chose to rely on his damaged lightsaber to escape when faced with battling three skilled enemies at once.<ref name="Twilight of the Apprentice" />

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:Eighth Brother lightsaber.png|thumb|right|110px|The Eighth Brother's lightsaber.]]
Like all Inquisitors, the Eighth Brother was Force-sensitive and possessed skill in the art of wielding a [[Double-bladed lightsaber|double-bladed]] spinning lightsaber. He also possessed the same [[TIE line|TIE Fighter design]] as his fellows. The Eighth Brother typically employed both of his lightsaber's blades in battle, and also employed them in order to propel away from enemies when outmatched. Additionally, his lightsaber had the unique ability to convert into a buzz-saw-like weapon that employed the handle while the blades were deactivated. In doing so, this allowed the emitters to be visibly seen. Other equipment the Brother used were a multitude of [[S-Mine Detonator]]s he kept on a bandoleer. Within easy reach, the Eighth Brother would throw these small explosives toward his enemies. He also wore a suit of [[Color|black]] and gray combat [[armor]] which bore the insignia of the Galactic Empire.<ref name="Twilight of the Apprentice" />

His fighting style was somewhat similar to the Seventh Sister's, given his slim and acrobatic build. However, he appeared to have been no more skilled than his fellow Inquisitors in battle, as illustrated by his losses on Malachor.<ref name="Twilight of the Apprentice" />
