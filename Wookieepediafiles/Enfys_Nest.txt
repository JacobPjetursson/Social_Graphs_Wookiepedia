{{Quote|We're not marauders. We're allies.|Enfys Nest|Solo: A Star Wars Story}}
'''Enfys Nest''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|female]] resistance fighter who led the [[Cloud-Riders]], a band of [[pirate]]s and rebel group that fought against the crime syndicate [[Crimson Dawn]]. Nest's skills as a pirate earned her a reputation as an infamous marauder including in [[Crimson Dawn]], who Nest and her Cloud-Riders actively fought against in retaliation for the atrocities Crimson Dawn had committed against them. Nest, who wore a [[battle helmet]] passed down to her from her [[Enfys Nest's mother|mother]], had run-ins with Crimson Dawn operative [[Tobias Beckett]] and his [[Beckett's gang|gang]].

In [[10 BBY]], Nest and the Cloud-Riders sparred with Beckett and his crew, including [[Han Solo]], as they competed for a score of valuable [[hyperspace]] fuel called [[coaxium]]. After both groups [[Heist on Vandor|failed]] to steal a shipment on [[Vandor]], Nest and her lieutenant, [[Weazel]], tracked Beckett’s crew as they stole coaxium from [[Kessel]]. Nest and the Cloud-Riders found Beckett’s crew on [[Savareen]], where she revealed the group’s true purpose as allies fighting against Crimson Dawn. Solo sided with Nest and they teamed up to steal the coaxium from Crimson Dawn, dealing the syndicate a critical blow in the process. Nest intended to use the coaxium to help give life to a [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|rebellion]], so she gave the coaxium to [[Saw Gerrera]] of the [[Partisans]] and his young ward, [[Jyn Erso]].

==Biography==
===Early life===

===Raid on Gargon===
{{Quote|Nest is not in it for the money. I believe she's building an army and readying to go to war.|Andressa Divo|Star Wars: Scum and Villainy: Case Files on the Galaxy's Most Notorious}}
[[File:Gargon.jpg|thumb|left|235px|Enfys Nest and the Cloud-Riders during the raid on Gargon]]
In [[11 BBY]],<ref name="Date Explanation">''[[Star Wars: Scum and Villainy: Case Files on the Galaxy's Most Notorious]]'' Establishes that the raid on Gargon took place in 7966 [[C.R.C.]], and the [[Boonta Eve Classic]] of [[Neva Kee]]'s disappearance took place in 7945 C.R.C. 21 years earlier. Given that ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates this [[Podracing|Podrace]] to [[32 BBY]], it can be calculated that the raid on Gargon occurred in [[11 BBY]].</ref> about a year following her ascension to leader of the Cloud-Riders, Nest led a squad of six marauders on a raid of an Imperial [[spice]] [[Gargon spice cache|cache]] on [[Gargon]]. The raiding party approached the cache aboard their [[swoop]] bikes and [[thief|stole]] its stores of medicinally processed spice, kept in ready-for-use triage kits and emergency packs. Although pursued by Imperial forces that came near to closing in on them, the Nest and the Cloud-Riders successfully escaped with their quarry. In the ensuing [[Imperial Security Bureau]] investigation of the incident, [[Agent]] [[Andressa Divo]] observed how the raiding party took only the medicinally processed spice, forgoing the raw spice that could be refined into a lucrative narcotic form and sold for immense profit. While her compatriots attributed this curiosity to a hurried escape forced by Imperial pursuit, Divo judged it was a deliberate decision on Nest's part and reflective of the ideological motives behind her gang's activities. She suspected Nest was not simply out to make a profit but fostering an insurrectionist movement against the Empire and preparing an [[army]] to go to war.<ref name="Star Wars: Scum and Villainy">''[[Star Wars: Scum and Villainy: Case Files on the Galaxy's Most Notorious]]''</ref>

===Tricking Beckett===
{{Quote|If you died trying to recover the blank I.D. chips, then I'd have gotten rid of some competition, but if you succeeded&mdash;even better.|Enfys Nest, to Tobias Beckett|Star Wars: Beckett 1}}
[[File:Enfys and Beckett.jpg|thumb|right|234px|Enfys Nest confronting Tobias Beckett]]
In need of some blank [[identichip]]s, Nest decided to trick her rival [[Tobias Beckett]] into acquiring some for her. Nest sent a transmission to Beckett and his [[Beckett's gang|crew]], posing as [[Dryden Vos]] of the Crimson Dawn. Believing Vos wanted them to steal blank identichips, Beckett and his crew [[Heist on Hovun IV|stole]] a package of identichips from [[Dvorad]] on [[Hovun IV]].<ref name="Beckett">''[[Star Wars: Beckett 1]]''</ref>

Beckett's gang took their cargo to the [[space station]] [[Munt Ontdal]] on the ''[[Rampart (Tobias Beckett)|Rampart]]''. However, when they arrived, they discovered that it had been a setup when Nest and her [[Cloud-Riders]] confronted them, managing to take them prisoner. Beckett tried to intimidate them with the threat of Dryden Vos showing up, but [[Val]] had deduced that Nest had been the one to send them on their mission. Nest threatened Beckett with a [[blaster]], asking him where the identichips had been hidden. To prevent Nest from getting the cargo, Beckett destroyed the ''Rampart'', escaping with his crew during the explosion.<ref name="Beckett" />

===Train heist on Vandor===
Having been a thorn in the side of Tobias Beckett and Crimson Dawn for an extended period of time, the possibility of Nest and the Cloud-Riders interfering with Beckett's [[heist on Vandor]] was brought up by Val, whose advice fell on deaf ears; Beckett had been assured that only he and his inside men had the knowledge of the supply carried by a [[20-T Railcrawler conveyex transport]] in the mountains of [[Vandor]]. However, Val's fears were soon proven correct when Enfys Nest arrived with her Cloud-Riders, attempting to thwart an attempt by Beckett's gang to steal a large quantity of [[coaxium]] from the conveyex, wanting to take the coaxium for themselves. As Beckett and his gang detached the train car carrying the hyperfuel, Nest and the Cloud-Riders, flying swoops, attached tow cables to the car and attempted to wrest the fuel from Beckett's stolen [[Y-45 armored transport hauler]], flown by [[Rio Durant]] and [[Han Solo]]. In the ensuing struggle, the coaxium cargo fell into a mountainous ravine, resulting in a huge explosion.<ref name="Solo" />

===Showdown on Savareen===
Beckett and his gang regrouped and managed to steal a second load of coaxium, this time in unrefined form, from the mines of [[Kessel]]. The unrefined hyperfuel was highly unstable and needed to quickly be processed at the [[Bis Refinery]] on the planet [[Savareen]]. After the fuel was processed, Beckett and his crew planned to deliver it to Dryden Vos, but were once again ambushed by Enfys Nest and the Cloud-Riders, who had been tracking them since Vandor. One of Beckett's crew members, Han Solo, attempted to bluff that the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' was poised to dispatch the Cloud-Riders, only for its owner, [[Lando Calrissian]], to flee the planet.<ref name="Solo" />

[[File:Enfys Nest and company.png|thumb|left|333px|Enfys Nest and the Cloud-Riders on Savareen]]
After a confrontation, Nest revealed that the Cloud-Riders were not "marauders" as Beckett had believed, but freedom fighters trying to stop crime syndicates and the Empire from gaining more power. Solo was sympathetic to her cause, and hatched a plan to double-cross Crimson Dawn for the coaxium. The Cloud-Riders would then temporarily go into hiding and villagers would pose as the Cloud-Riders in order to lure away the Crimson Dawn's [[Hylobon Enforcers]] so Vos would be alone and easy to kill.<ref name="Solo" />

Solo's plan worked and the Hylobon Enforcers disarmed the "Cloud-Riders", securing the coaxium vault. Before they could take the coaxium back to Vos, Nest and the real Cloud-Riders appeared in the encampment, ambushing and quickly defeating all of the guards. After the deaths of both Vos and Beckett, Solo handed the coaxium over to Nest, who stated that such a large quantity of the valuable material would help fund a rebellion against the Empire. She gave one of the vials of coaxium, offering Han a chance to join her movement, which he politely refused, leaving Savareen.<ref name="Solo" />

===Meeting with Saw Gerrera===
{{Quote|Saw Gerrera.''"<br />"''Enfys Nest. I hope you have good news for me.''"<br />"''Refined coaxium, enough to power a fleet, I trust you will put it to good use.|Enfys Nest and Saw Gerrera|Solo: A Star Wars Story: Expanded Edition}}
Backed by her Cloud-Riders, Nest delivered the coaxium acquired on Savareen to the [[Partisans|Partisan]] leader [[Saw Gerrera]]. Meeting on the condition that Gererra come alone, Nest was vexed by sounds of another person from within his [[shuttle]] and the Cloud-Riders readied their weapons for a fight. Gererra diffused the situation by revealing the companion was his eleven-year-old ward, [[Jyn Erso]]. Jyn had wanted to accompany him, curious to observe the exchange; believing she needed to learn to survive the dangers of the Empire, Gerrera allowed it. While initially surprised by her presence, Nest saw much of her younger self in the young girl and sensed Jyn lost her innocence at a young age much as she had. Choosing to break with her custom of hiding her identity and age even from potential allies, she removed her mask to reveal she herself was very young. Nest asked Jyn if she thought her age protected her. When the girl said no, she warned Jyn that people would still underestimate her and advised she make them regret it. Redirecting their attentions to the true purpose of the meeting, Gerrera and Nest boarded his shuttle to negotiate the exchange of coaxium, leaving the Cloud-Riders behind to secure the [[starship|ship]]. As Nest walked in, Jyn quietly told her that Gerrera would underestimate her, impressing the older woman with how quickly she learned.<ref name="Expanded Edition" />

Though she thought after the first one that she had messed up, she was called again, so she did it better. In her third audition, she finally met Han Solo's portrayer [[Alden Ehrenreich]] and they did a screen test together. Kellyman was also tested on how well she fought, and went through some stunt tests just before her audition with Ehrenreich, though some of the stunts in the film were performed by Kellyman's stunt double [[Casey Michaels]].<ref name="Erin's Interview">{{SW|url=news/erin-kellyman-enfys-nest|text=Unmasking Enfys Nest: An Interview with Erin Kellyman|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20181002055355/https://www.starwars.com/news/erin-kellyman-enfys-nest|archivedate=2018-10-02}}</ref>
