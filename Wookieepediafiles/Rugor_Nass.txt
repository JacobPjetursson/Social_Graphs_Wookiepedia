'''Rugor Nass''' was a [[Gungan]] [[Sexes|male]] who served as the [[Boss]] of the Gungan people during the [[Trade Federation]]'s [[Invasion of Naboo|invasion]] of [[Naboo]]. Nass governed the Gungans from the [[city]] of [[Otoh Gunga]] within Naboo's [[ocean]]s, keeping a close eye on Gungan affairs and, for a [[time]], ensuring that the Gungans and the [[human]] [[Naboo (people)|population]] of Naboo did not interact. He initially refused to help the Naboo during the invasion, rejecting [[Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and [[Padawan]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] when they requested it, but ultimately had a change of heart when [[Monarch of Naboo|Queen]] [[Padmé Amidala]] knelt and pleaded her case before him in behalf of the Naboo and the Gungans, promising that administration the planet's affairs would be shared between the two races from that time forth. After the [[Battle of Naboo]], in which the Naboo and the Gungans were victorious over the Federation, Nass joined Queen Amidala in peace. Nass' tenure as Boss ended sometime before the [[Clone Wars]], and he attended Amidala's [[Funeral of Padmé Amidala|funeral]] after her [[death]] at the end of the war.

==Biography==
===Background===
[[Boss]] Rugor Nass was born on Naboo prior to the Invasion of Naboo. He became the ruler of the Gungans sometime later.<ref name="Episode I" /> He governed his people from the underwater city of [[Otoh Gunga]] beneath the planet [[Naboo]]'s [[Lake Paonga]]. Some time before the Invasion of Naboo, Boss Nass banished [[Jar Jar Binks]] for crashing his personal [[heyblibber]] [[submarine]].<ref name="SWAEYNTK">''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know]]''</ref> Due to the difficult relationship between the Gungans and the [[human]] [[Naboo (people)|Naboo]], Boss Nass thought the Naboo to be arrogant and condescending towards his people.<ref name="Episode I" />

===Invasion of Naboo===
Shortly after the Trade Federation invasion, Boss Nass held an audience with the [[Jedi]] ambassadors [[Jedi Master|Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]], his [[Padawan]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], and Jar Jar Binks. Binks had led the Jedi ambassadors to Otoh Gunga but had been arrested by [[Captain]] [[Roos Tarpals]] for breaking his banishment. Master Jinn had come to warn the Gungans about the threat posed by the Trade Federation to the entire planet. Believing this to be a matter between the Naboo and Federation, Nass refused to get involved. However, he told them that the speediest way to the Naboo people was through the planet's core.<ref name="Episode I" />

When Master Jinn asked what was to happen to Binks, Nass replied that he would be punished. Jinn came to Bink's defense by pointing out that he had saved the Gungan's life and that Binks owed him a [[life debt]]. Master Jinn's words convinced Boss Nass, who allowed Binks to leave as a guide for the two Jedi. Boss Nass provided Binks and the Jedi with a [[Gungan bongo submarine|bongo submarine]] to reach [[Theed]]. Despite the Gungans' refusal to get involved in the conflict, the Trade Federation soon turned its attention to the Gungan cities, leading to an evacuation of Otoh Gunga.<ref name="Episode I" />

Later, the [[Monarch of Naboo|Naboo Queen]] [[Padmé Amidala]] traveled to the [[Gungan sacred place]] to forge an alliance with Boss Nass and the Gungans. After Amidala's decoy [[Sabé]] initiated contact with Nass, Amidala revealed herself in order to gain his trust. She told Boss Nass that the Trade Federation had destroyed all that the Naboo and Gungans had built and fought for. If they did not work together, the Trade Federation would dominate the planet. Swayed by Amidala's appeal, Boss Nass decided to put aside his people's distrust of the Naboo and to be friends. As a result, the Gungans agreed to assist the Naboo and the [[Jedi]] in expelling the Trade Federation. To honor Binks for his role in bringing the two peoples together, Nass made him [[Bombad General]] of the [[Gungan Grand Army]] which diverted the Federation's army away from Theed and subsequently laughed loudly when Binks fainted in front of him.<ref name="Episode I" />

Boss Nass was later present at the joint victory celebrations held at Theed. There, he received a symbolic orb from Queen Amidala and vowed that the two peoples would live in peace.<ref name="Episode I" />

===The Clone Wars===
Rugor Nass' tenure as Boss ended at some time prior to the [[Clone Wars]]. He was succeeded by Boss [[Lyonie]], who served during that conflict.<ref name="Gungan Attack">{{TCW|Gungan Attack}}</ref> At the end of the Clone Wars, the former Queen Amidala died and Nass attended her funeral alongside Jar Jar Binks with a heavy heart, mourning the loss of both a dear friend and the woman who helped bring peace between their peoples.<ref name="Episode III">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref>

==Personality and traits==
Rugor Nass was a confident and proud ruler of the Gungan people. He was a pudgy and heavily-built Gungan who dressed in ornate robes befitting his status as a ruler. His personality was very loud and bombastic, though this was tempered somewhat when in formal circumstances, and he also had a considerable sense of humour, laughing uproariously when Jar Jar Binks fainted. He regarded the Human Naboo as arrogant and condescending towards his people and was initially reluctant to help them during the Trade Federation invasion of their planet.<ref name="Episode I" /> Nass also initially had a low opinion of Jar Jar Binks after the latter crashed his personal bongo submarine; leading the former to banish Binks into the swamps.<ref name="SWAEYNTK" />

While initially wary of the Naboo, Nass came to respect Queen Padmé Amidala after she urged the two people to put aside their differences in order to save their homeworld and civilizations from the Trade Federation. As a result, Nass buried his people's hatchet with the Naboo and committed the Gungan Grand Army to driving out the Federation. Following the expulsion of the Trade Federation, Nass publicly expressed his desire for the Gungans and Naboo to live in peace.<ref name="Episode I" />
