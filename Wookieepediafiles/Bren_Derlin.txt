{{Quote|Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight. The shield doors must be closed.|Major Bren Derlin|Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}
'''Bren Derlin''' was a [[Sexes|male]] [[human]] [[officer]] of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]]. Bearing the rank of [[Major]], Derlin served as the operations and [[Chief of Security|security chief]] at [[Echo Base]], the Alliance headquarters on the [[planet]] [[Hoth]], under the command of [[General]] [[Carlist Rieekan]]. In that post, Derlin had to order the closing of the base door to avoid putting the whole base in risk. By doing so, however, he risked the lives of [[Luke Skywalker]] and [[Han Solo]], two valuable Rebels. Soon after that event, Derlin served during the [[Battle of Hoth]], and later during the [[Battle of Endor]].

==Biography==
A [[Sexes|male]] [[human]] from the [[planet]] [[Tiisheraan]],<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" /> Bren Derlin was part of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]], a resistance group who [[Galactic Civil War|opposed]] the dictatorial [[Galactic Empire]]. He and his team were acquainted with fellow Alliance operative [[Nakari Kelen]], who taught them how to better handle a [[sniper rifle]].<ref name="HttJ">''[[Heir to the Jedi]]''</ref>

===Mission to Omereth===
{{Quote|We couldn't leave the family here on their own or it would have become a hostage situation, and if we tried to pick a fight, we'd have been outgunned.|Major Bren Derlin, explaining the stalemate between his team and the bounty hunters to Luke Skywalker|Heir to the Jedi}}
Following the [[Battle of Yavin]], Derlin was part of the mission to rescue [[Givin]] [[slicer]] [[Drusil Bephorin]] and her family from the Empire. He was ordered to escort her family to [[Omereth]] to await [[Lieutenant]] [[Luke Skywalker]]'s arrival with Bephorin. While extracting the family after receiving word that Skywalker had rescued Bephorin, Derlin and his team were discovered by [[bounty hunter]]s who had been attracted by a [[bounty]] placed by the Empire for the return of Bephorin and her family. Derlin and his team fought off the hunters and fled to Omereth in their ship, but three members of his team were [[Death|killed]] and the hunters followed them to the [[water]]y world. The bounty hunters trapped the Rebels into a stalemate at their rendezvous point, jammed their communications, and waited for Skywalker to arrive with Bephorin. Derlin and his team were unable to break free from the siege and were forced to place their hopes in Skywalker being able to defeat the hunters when he arrived.<ref name="HttJ" />

Derlin's hopes were well-placed, as Skywalker was able to eliminate the bounty hunters upon his arrival. After Skywalker landed at the rendezvouses point, Derlin explained to him what had happened and was saddened to hear that Kelen, who had been working with Skywalker, had been killed during the fight against the bounty hunters. Derlin then set up a dead drop site for Bephorin to contact the Alliance at and departed Omereth with his team and Skywalker to return Kelen's body to her [[Fayet Kelen|father]] on [[Pasher]] before rejoining the [[Alliance Fleet]].<ref name="HttJ" />

===Echo Base===
{{Quote|Okay. Everybody to your stations. Let's go!|Major Bren Derlin, to Rebel pilots|Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}
[[File:AlderDerlin-ESB.png|thumb|left|250px|Major Bren Derlin and the Deck Lieutenant at Echo Base]]
Around three [[Standard year|years]] later, the Alliance chose to have a presence on the frozen planet [[Hoth]], where they established [[Echo Base]]. Derlin was assigned there. One [[Standard day|day]], Skywalker, now a [[Commander]], and [[Captain]] [[Han Solo]] went on a patrol and failed to return to the base before the night. Derlin had to close the main doors of the Base, to protect the other people there from the cold night [[temperature]]&mdash;but at the same time, that meant leaving Skywalker and Solo outside for the night, with almost no chance of surviving. He waited at the main door, near [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Organa]], an important dignitary of the base and close friend to both Skywalker and Solo. The young deck lieutenant of the base reported to Derlin that Skywalker and Solo had failed to return. Derlin had the unenviable task to report Organa about the need of closing the doors. He waited for Organa to acknowledge his words, and then ordered the Deck Lieutenant to close the doors. The following day, Skywalker and Solo were rescued by the [[airspeeder]] searchers. Shortly thereafter, the Empire discovered Echo Base and organized [[Battle of Hoth|a ground attack]] against it. Imperial [[General]] [[Maximillian Veers]] commanded several highly-armored [[All Terrain Armored Transport|AT-ATs]] to raid the base. The commanders of the base assigned [[T-47 airspeeder|snowspeeders]] to the available [[Rebel pilot|pilots]] so that they could oppose the [[walker]]s, while the Alliance evacuated the planet in [[transport]]s. Organa and Derlin briefed the [[pilot]]s with their instructions, and they were quick to obey.<ref name="ESB" />

===The Endor Moon===
{{expandsect}}
Six [[Standard month|months]] after the Hoth debacle, Derlin was tasked to lead a [[commando]] team in the ground portion of the [[Battle of Endor]].<ref name="CL 2016">''[[Star Wars: Complete Locations (2016)|Star Wars: Complete Locations]]''</ref>
