{{Quote|But you can not stop the change, no more than you can stop the suns from setting.|Shmi Skywalker, to her son Anakin Skywalker|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace}}
'''Shmi Skywalker Lars''', formerly known as '''Shmi Skywalker''', was a [[human]] [[Sexes|female]] who lived in [[slavery]] on the [[planet]] [[Tatooine]] during the [[Fall of the Republic|last]] [[Standard year|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic]]. During her [[time]] as a slave, she gave [[Reproduction|birth]] to a [[Youngling|child]] called [[Anakin Skywalker]]. In [[32 BBY]] her son was discovered by [[Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]], who found the boy to be unusually [[Force-sensitive|strong]] with [[the Force]]. He learned through Shmi that there was no father involved in Anakin's conception, leading Jinn to believe that Anakin was conceived by the [[midi-chlorian]]s. With Shmi's support, Anakin was taken by Jinn to the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]] on [[Coruscant]] and presented to the [[Jedi High Council|leaders]] of the [[Jedi Order]] as the [[Chosen One]]&mdash;the one who was destined to restore balance to the Force, according to [[Jedi]] prophecy.

After Anakin left Tatooine to begin his [[Jedi training]], Shmi [[Marriage|married]] [[Cliegg Lars]]&mdash;a [[moisture farmer]] who freed her from slavery&mdash;and became a stepmother to his son, [[Owen Lars]]. In the waning [[Standard day|days]] of the [[Separatist Crisis]], Shmi was [[Prisoner|abducted]] and subjected to [[torture]] by a group of [[Tusken Raider]]s in [[22 BBY]]. By then, her son had returned to Tatooine as a Jedi [[Padawan]] but was unable to prevent his mother's [[Death|demise]]. As a result, Anakin massacred the Tusken Raiders, including their women and children, and buried his mother at the [[Lars moisture farm]]. Shortly after Shmi's death, her son went on to become a [[Jedi Knight]], as well as a [[Jedi General|general]] in the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] during [[the galaxy]]-wide conflict known as the [[Clone Wars]].

==Biography==
===Background===
[[File:Anakinandmom.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Shmi and her son Anakin parting ways]]
At some point, Shmi Skywalker was sold in a market like the [[Zygerrian slave market]] [[Sexes|her]] future son [[Anakin Skywalker|Anakin]] [[Mission to Zygerria|visited]] during the [[Clone Wars]].<ref name="SOTR">{{TCW|Slaves of the Republic}}</ref> Eventually, Shmi became a [[Slavery|slave]] and lived on the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] [[Planet|world]] of [[Tatooine]] during the [[Fall of the Republic|last]] [[Standard decade|decades]] of the [[Galactic Republic]]. About nine [[Standard year|years]] before the [[Battle of Naboo]], [[Sexes|she]] gave [[Reproduction|birth]] to a [[Force-sensitive]] son named Anakin. At one point, Shmi and Anakin were owned by the female [[Hutt]] [[crime lord]] [[Gardulla Besadii the Elder|Gardulla]] until she lost them in a [[Gambling|bet]] with the [[Toydarian]] [[junk dealer]] [[Watto]], who employed Anakin's services at his [[Watto's shop|shop]]. While Watto could be a harsh and demanding master, he still furnished them with a [[Skywalker home|home]] in [[Mos Espa]]'s [[Slave Quarters Row|slave quarters]]. In addition, Shmi and her son also owned a few personal possessions including an antiquated [[protocol droid]] named [[C-3PO]] and a [[Anakin Skywalker's Podracer|podracer]].<ref name="TPM" />

===Losing her son===
One [[Standard day|day]], Anakin returned home with several strangers including the [[Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]], the [[Naboo]] [[Monarch of Naboo|Queen]] [[Padm√© Amidala]], disguised as a [[Naboo Royal Handmaidens|handmaiden]], the [[Gungan]] [[Jar Jar Binks]], and the [[astromech droid]] [[R2-D2]], who were seeking shelter from a [[sandstorm]]. While Shmi and her son had initially believed that these offworlders had come to free slaves, they quickly learned that the strangers had become stranded on Tatooine after [[Naboo Royal Starship|their]] [[starship]]'s [[hyperdrive]] was damaged during a [[diplomat]]ic [[Invasion of Naboo|mission]] to [[The galaxy|the galactic]] [[capital]], [[Coruscant]]. When Anakin offered to help Jinn and his companions to obtain [[Currency|money]] for the [[T-14 hyperdrive generator|hyperdrive]] by winning the upcoming [[Boonta Eve Classic]] [[Podracing|podrace]], Shmi initially disagreed with the idea. However, she relented when Anakin recalled her words on helping others.<ref name="TPM" />

While Anakin repaired his [[podracer]], Shmi told Jinn about her son's birth. Later, Jinn tested Anakin and discovered that he was [[The Force|Force]]-sensitive. Due to his high concentration of [[Midi-chlorian]]s, Jinn believed that Anakin was the prophesied [[Chosen One]]. The following day, Jinn offered to sponsor Anakin for the upcoming Boonta Eve race in return for securing Shmi and her son's emancipation if Anakin won that race. However, Watto was unwilling to relinquish both slaves at the same [[time]]. Instead, they reached a compromise where Watto agreed to free Anakin if he won the race. The following day, Shmi along with the offworld visitors attended the Boonta Eve Classic. Despite great odds, her son Anakin won the race, and Watto was forced to honor his promise to emancipate Anakin.<ref name="TPM" />

Following the race, Shmi and her son embraced each other with Shmi expressing pride in her son's achievements. After securing Anakin's earnings from Watto, Jinn informed Shmi that he had secured Anakin's emancipation and offered to [[Jedi training|train]] him as a [[Jedi]]. With much difficulty, Shmi decided to part with her son. Realizing that Anakin would have a better future offworld, Shmi advised her son to grasp this new opportunity and told him to let her go on the rationale that her place and future was on Tatooine. Prior to leaving for his new life on Coruscant, Anakin made a solemn vow that he would return and free her.<ref name="TPM" />

===Emancipation, captivity, and death===
A few years before the [[Battle of Geonosis|outbreak]] of the [[Cloning|Clone]] Wars, Shmi met a [[moisture farmer]] named [[Cliegg Lars]], who bought her from Watto and emancipated her. The two subsequently fell in love, [[Marriage|married]], and lived together at the [[Lars moisture farm]] in Tatooine's [[Jundland Wastes]]. One [[Standard month|month]] before the Battle of [[Geonosis]], Shmi was out gathering [[mushroom]]s in the morning when a group of [[Tusken Raider]]s kidnapped her. Cliegg assembled a rescue party but lost most of his companions and his right [[Limb|leg]] during the rescue attempt. Believing Shmi to be [[Death|dead]] and unwilling to risk any more lives, Lars abandoned the rescue.<ref name="AOTC" />

However, Shmi was still alive but had been severely [[torture]]d and brutalized. Meanwhile, her son Anakin, who had become a Jedi [[Padawan]] under [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], sensed her distress through the Force. Anakin [[Mission to Tatooine (Separatist Crisis)|immediately]] set off to Tatooine to find and save her; he convinced [[Senator]] Amidala, to accompany him. After meeting with Watto, Anakin and Amidala arrived at the [[Lars family]] [[farm]] and learned about his [[Parent|mother's]] fate after Anakin left for Coruscant: freedom, marrying Cliegg and becoming stepmother to [[Owen Lars]], and her kidnapping. Despite Cliegg' warnings and advice, Anakin traveled into the wilderness to find her. He eventually stumbled on a [[Tusken Raider camp]].<ref name="AOTC" />

[[File:Shmidyng.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Shmi dies in the arms of her son]]
After infiltrating the camp, he found the [[tent]] where Shmi was being held. There, Anakin encountered a bound and emaciated Shmi, who was near death. Prior to her death, she managed to tell her son that she was proud of him and that she loved him. Shmi's death threw Anakin into a fit of rage, and he took his first step to the [[dark side of the Force]]. In his rage, Anakin avenged his mother by coldly killing every Tusken Raider in the encampment, including the women and [[Youngling|children]]. The following morning, Anakin returned to the Lars [[moisture farm]] with his mother's body. Shmi was mourned by both her son Anakin and Cliegg, as well as Amidala, Owen, and his girlfriend, [[Beru Whitesun Lars|Beru]], who all attended her [[Funeral of Shmi Skywalker Lars|funeral]].<ref name="AOTC" /> Beru served [[blue milk]] (and [[cheese]]) to everyone after.<ref name="Beru Whitesun Lars">{{Shortstory|story=Beru Whitesun Lars (short story)|sformatted=Beru Whitesun Lars|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>

===Legacy===
[[File:ShmiAnakinCloneWars.png|left|thumb|200px|The Son impersonating Shmi during a Force vision on Mortis]]
Shmi's death had a profound effect on influencing her son Anakin's journey to the dark side. Prior to his mother's [[burial]], Anakin told Amidala that he regretted not being strong enough to save his mother. He also vowed that he would one day become so powerful that he could learn to stop people from dying. Finally, Skywalker confessed to his role in murdering the Tusken Raiders to avenge his mother's death.<ref name="AOTC" /> Skywalker's guilt about not being able to prevent Shmi's death made him susceptible to [[Darth Sidious]]' efforts to win him over to the dark side.<ref name="ROTS">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref>

During the Clone Wars, Anakin experienced a [[Force vision]] of Shmi on the planet [[Mortis]], where he had been put through a series of tests by three powerful beings known as the [[Force wielder]]s who wanted to determine whether he truly was the Chosen One. In reality, the [[Son]], one of the Force wielders who embodied the dark side of the Force, had assumed the form of his late mother. The false Shmi told Anakin to give up his love for Amidala, whom he had secretly [[Wedding of Anakin Skywalker and Padm√© Amidala|married]] shortly after the Battle of Geonosis, saying that he did not truly love her and that she was [[poison]] to him before transforming into the Son.<ref name="Overlords">{{TCW|Overlords}}</ref>

By [[18 BBY]], Kenobi, who lived in [[Exile (punishment)|exile]] on Tatooine, had gone to Shmi's grave to apologize for losing her son.<ref name="Ahsoka">''[[Ahsoka (novel)|Ahsoka]]''</ref> Years later Kenobi left toys for [[Luke Skywalker]] next to Shmi's sandblasted tombstone for Beru to find.<ref name="Time of Death- From a Certain Point of View">{{Shortstory|story=Time of Death|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>

==Personality and traits==
Shmi Skywalker Lars was a peaceful, selfless and kind person. She loved her son Anakin and was willing to sacrifice herself in order to let Anakin to have the possibility of a better life.<ref name="TPM" />

Cliegg claimed that Shmi was the best partner a man could ask for, as he was deeply affected by Shmi's death at the hands of the Tusken Raiders.<ref name="AOTC" />

==Behind the scenes==
Shmi Skywalker was portrayed by Swedish actress [[Pernilla August]] in [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']] and [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]. She reprised her role as Shmi in the ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)| The Clone Wars]]'' [[The Clone Wars: Season Three|season 3]] episode "[[Overlords]]."

In [[1998]], it was announced that Anakin Skywalker's mother would be named Shmi and that August would portray her. When the [[original trilogy]] was [[The Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition|rereleased in theaters and VHS]] to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']] [[1997|the year before]], ''[[Star Wars Trivial Pursuit]]'' was released to coincide with this. The limited edition game contained a sequestered pack of questions that served as a preview of the first new trilogy installment, two of which divulged those bits of information.

In one of the first drafts of ''The Phantom Menace'', her name was Shmi Warka.
