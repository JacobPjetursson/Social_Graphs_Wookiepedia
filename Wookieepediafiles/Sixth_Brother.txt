The '''Sixth Brother''' was a [[Sexes|male]] member of the [[Inquisitorius]]. In the [[Standard year|year]] following the end of the [[Clone Wars]], the Sixth Brother, and the rest of the Inquisitors, hunted for [[Force-sensitive]] children as well as [[Jedi]] who survived [[Order 66]]. He [[Battle of Dac City|accompanied]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], the [[Ninth Sister]] and the [[Tenth Brother]] to the [[planet]] [[Mon Cala]] to [[Jedi Purge|hunt]] an [[Ferren Barr|enemy]] of the Empire. He was [[Death|killed]] by [[Ahsoka Tano]] during the [[Uprising on Raada|uprising]] on [[Raada]].

==Biography==
===Fallen Jedi===
[[File:Dismemberment Inquisitor.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Vader severs Sixth Brother's left forearm]]
The individual who became known as the Sixth Brother was originally a member of the [[Jedi Order]]. At some point after the [[Galactic Republic]] was reorganized into the [[Galactic Empire]], he was inducted into an Imperial agency of fallen Jedi assassins called the [[Inquisitorius]], which was tasked with hunting down and eliminating any [[Jedi]] who survived [[Order 66]]. To accomplish this, he and his [[Brother/Sister|colleagues]] were trained by [[the Grand Inquisitor]] in the [[Inquisitorius Headquarters]] located in [[The Works]].<ref name="Dark Lord 6" />

The Inquisitorious soon fell under the command of [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] when [[Darth Sidious]] first demonstrated the Inquisitorius to Vader, who continued their training in the ways of the [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]] of [[the Force]].<ref name="Dark Lord 6" /> Vader came to train them in an attempt to eliminate the more defensive strategy they earned in their [[time]] with the Jedi. The Sixth Brother faced off with Vader in a training session and the [[Sith Lord]] [[Dismemberment|cut]] off his lower left arm to teach him the lesson of loss. The Grand Inquisitor asked Vader why he trained the Inquisitors like this, to which he revealed his intention to make their fighting techniques more aggressive.<ref name="Dark Lord 7" />

===Mission to Mon Cala===
====Battle of Dac City====
{{Quote|Uh&hellip;we may have a problem here.|The Sixth Brother, to Darth Vader and the other Inquisitors|Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 14: Burning Seas, Part II}}
In [[18 BBY]], the Sixth Brother, [[Ninth Sister]] and [[Tenth Brother]] accompanied Vader and a squad of [[Inquisitor Trooper]]s to [[Mon Cala]] on a [[Battle of Dac City|mission]] to search for a rumoured Jedi who had been [[Advisor|advising]] the [[King of Mon Cala]] in negotiations with the Empire. Upon arrival, the Tenth Brother described the [[planet]] as smelling like [[fish]] and the Ninth Sister claimed it was merely Sixth Brother. Sixth Brother sarcastically complemented it and Ninth Sister stepped down to speak with the [[King]]'s [[Chief of Security|chief of security]] [[Gial Ackbar]]. Vader came down to take over from Ninth Sister and an [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle|Imperial shuttle]] exploded nearby. Vader took the three Inquisitors into [[Dac City]] to begin their search.<ref name="Dark Lord 13">''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 13: Burning Seas, Part I]]''</ref>

After a large battle broke out between the Empire and the Mon Cala at Dac City, the Sixth Brother and his fellow Inquisitors participated in the fight as they pursued the King [[Lee-Char]], to the [[Dac City palace]] in order to find the location of the Jedi who was advising him. They eventually made it into the palace after killing many [[Mon Calamari]] and [[Quarren]] defenders and Ninth Sister began interrogating Lee-Char. But before long, a swarm of [[Unidentified Mon Cala creature|large creatures]] arose to the surface and generated waves so large, it swept the surface of Imperials. Sixth Brother and the others attempted to hold off the waves but they weren't strong enough to do so, not even when Vader assisted them.<ref name="Dark Lord 14">''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 14: Burning Seas, Part II]]''</ref>

====Pursuing the Jedi====
{{Quote|You're ''dead'', Sixth! This won't stop me&hellip;and then you're ''dead''!''"<br />"''Keep the clones busy for a while, will you, Ninth Sister? Good luck. You were always my favourite.|The Ninth Sister and Sixth Brother, after he cut her right leg off|Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 17: Burning Seas, Part V}}
[[File:Vader_Inquisitors_Bel_City.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Darth Vader, the Sixth Brother, Ninth Sister and Tenth Brother accompanied by Inquisitor Troopers in Bel City.]]
Luckily, Sixth Brother and the other two Inquisitors survived and took an [[Imperial submarine]] to find Vader. After picking him up, Ninth Sister revealed to Vader that she'd found the Jedi's location and they took the submarine towards the location.<ref name="Dark Lord 15">''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 15: Burning Seas, Part III]]''</ref> The submarine took them to the location where the Jedi and his six acolytes were evacuating their [[Ferren Barr's cave refuge|refuge]]. The group of them immediately scattered except for [[Nipaltoo|one]] acolyte who attacked the submarine, only for Vader to crush his helmet. As the other ones swam away, the submarine made chase and [[Orvek|another acolyte]] sacrificed himself to slow it down.<ref name="Dark Lord 16">''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 16: Burning Seas, Part IV]]''</ref>

The submarine arrived at [[Bel City]] where another two acolytes were waiting to ambush them. Vader took them through the hallways where he received an order from [[Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]], redirecting him to capture Lee-Char. The other inquisitors continued the chase, back by the Inquisitor troopers. They found the Jedi and his last two acolytes and Sixth Brother cut [[Daren|one]] of them down with his lightsaber. He then asked the other two what Barr had said beforehand and Tenth Brother claimed his hearing was exceptional, saying that Barr had said there was no way out. Sixth Brother and the other two Inquisitors then surrounded the Jedi and his last acolyte, [[Verla]], backed by their Inquisitor troopers.

With no other choice, the Jedi confronted the inquisitors but then began stating their original names from when they were Jedi. The Ninth Sister knew who the Jedi was and revealed the his name, [[Ferren Barr]], stating that he was still a mere [[Padawan]] who lacked the training he needed to take them on. Barr ignored her insults and continued, explaining the role of the clones in order 66 and pointing out that the Inquisitor troopers had been mobilized after Order 66 was activated. After saying this Sixth Brother pointed his lightsaber at Barr but he claimed once again that they were still Jedi and used a [[mind trick]] on the Inquisitor troopers, telling them to "execute order 66".<ref name="Dark Lord 16" />

[[File:Once a Jedi Always a Jedi DV17.png|thumb|left|250px|The Inquisitor troopers turn on the Inquisitors]]
The troopers fell for Barr's trick and turned on the Inquisitors. Tenth Brother protested to them that they were not Jedi, but it was too late. The troopers [[Skirmish in Bel City|open fired]] at them and the Inquisitors were forced to deflect their shots. Tenth Brother was hit in the chest and killed. Barr and Verla then leaped over the battle and escaped. Keen to intercept them, Sixth Brother told Ninth Sister they should do the same. Ninth Sister recommended moving them out of the way instead and they both [[Force push]]ed the troopers to the side. However, Sixth Brother decided to slash Ninth Sister's knee, cutting her leg off and leaving her to fend off the last of the troopers. After his escape, Sixth Brother took a boat away with three [[stormtrooper]]s and passed many creatures that had been killed by the [[Occupation of Mon Cala|fighting]] on Mon Cala.<ref name="Dark Lord 17">''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 17: Burning Seas, Part V]]''</ref>

===Investigating Force-sensitives===
{{Quote|There was a shadow while you were away.|[[Hedala Fardi]], to Ahsoka Tano|Ahsoka (novel)}}
Sometime later, the Sixth Brother intercepted surveillance holos and reports indicating that there was a [[Hedala Fardi|Force-sensitive child]] on the planet [[Thabeska]]. He went to the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] world to investigate, but was unable to locate the child. While on Thabeska, the Brother received a message from a low-level district [[commander]] on the [[moon]] of [[Raada]]. The report indicated that a Force-sensitive being, old enough to have received [[Jedi training]], was active on the backwater moon. The Brother then proceeded to close his file on the child on Thabeska and head to Raada to investigate a possible Jedi.<ref name="Ahsoka" />

===Hunting Ahsoka Tano===
The Sixth Brother traveled to Raada to hunt down the Jedi spotted on the small agricultural moon. He learned from [[Jenneth Pilar]], an [[information broker]] working with the Empire on the moon, that a Jedi or Padawan had been involved in an [[Uprising on Raada|uprising]] by the local [[farm]]ing community. During the uprising, teenage farm worker [[Kaeden Larte]] had been captured and [[torture]]d for information. The Brother scoffed at the techniques used on Larte, which proved ineffective. He learned that Kaeden was then broken out of the [[Imperial base (Raada)|Imperial base]] by a [[Ahsoka Tano|Force-sensitive being]].<ref name="Ahsoka" />

The Brother tracked down Kaeden and the other farm workers, who had hidden in a set of [[mountain]] [[cave]]s not far the [[Unidentified settlement (Raada)|settlement]]. Kaeden surrendered herself to the Inquisitor, but her friends soon attacked him. The Brother deflected the [[blaster]] bolts shot by the farmers, [[Death|killing]] them. As a show of strength, the Brother threw [[Sixth Brother's lightsaber|his]] [[lightsaber]] at the [[Rodian]] farmer, [[Kolvin (Rodian)|Kolvin]], who was instantly cut in half.<ref name="Ahsoka" />

To lure the Jedi back to Raada, the Brother had footage of himself holding Kaeden prisoner leaked. Upon seeing it, Ahsoka Tano returned to Raada, having arranged for the evacuation of the moon's population. She was in the process of building a new [[Ahsoka Tano's white lightsabers|pair of lightsabers]], and heard the [[kyber crystal]]s in the Brother's [[Double-bladed lightsaber|double-bladed]] [[Double-bladed spinning lightsaber|lightsaber]] sing to her. During her battle with the Brother, Tano used the Force to pull the crystals from his lightsaber. The lightsaber became unstable and exploded, killing the Sixth Brother.<ref name="Ahsoka" />

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|I have a sense for power. And you do not have enough to resist me for much longer, weaponless as you are.|The Sixth Brother, to Ahsoka Tano|Ahsoka (novel)|Ahsoka}}
[[File:Sixth_Brother.png|thumb|right|125px|The Sixth Brother]]
The Sixth Brother was of a [[humanoid]] species which neither Kaeden Larte or Ahsoka Tano were able to identify. He was described as tall and broad-shouldered, with unnatural-looking gray skin, piercing ice-blue eyes, and scar-like uniform markings on his cheeks, nose, and chin. Like his fellow Inquisitors, he wore black and grey body armour and carried a double-bladed spinning lightsaber. He also wore a helmet with a blast shield that could be lowered to protect his face.<ref name="Ahsoka" />

The Sixth Brother had an uncertain relationship with his fellow Inquisitors, from whom he feared competition. Upon arriving on Mon Cala, Ninth Sister and Tenth Brother insulted him to which he sarcastically complimented as a response.<ref name="Dark Lord 13" /> When picking up Darth Vader under Mon Cala's oceans, Sixth Brother assumed Vader would be thankful for it, but Vader only said that he could handle himself.<ref name="Dark Lord 15" /> During the fight in Bel City, Sixth Brother was keen to make pursue Ferren Barr and attempted to jump to conclusions with what he and Ninth Sister would do. After pushing away the Inquisitor troopers, Sixth Brother betrayed Ninth Sister and cut off her leg so she could hold off the rest of the troopers. When Ninth Sister threatened to kill him, he mockingly told her good luck and that she was always his favourite.<ref name="Dark Lord 17" />

The Sixth Brother was ruthless, being completely comfortable with the idea of killing innocent beings&mdash;even children&mdash;and detesting the aspects of his mission that prevented him from acting in such a matter. He was known to have relished the idea of facing more challenging prey, which was his primary motivation of abandoning his task of tracking a Force-sensitive child in favour of hunting Ahsoka Tano. He was also arrogant, claiming himself to be "the future" and displaying overconfidence during his fight with Tano, which ultimately led to his demise.<ref name="Ahsoka" />

==Powers and abilities==
{{Quote|He's had some training. He mostly relies on brute strength. If he was going to be facing Jedi, or someone with my level of training, I'd say he wouldn't be much of a threat. I defeated him without my lightsabers.|Ahsoka Tano, to [[Bail Organa]]|Ahsoka (novel)|Ahsoka}}
The Sixth Brother was trained by the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] Darth Vader. Vader trained him to lose the defensive tactics he had developed as a Jedi and rely primarily on offensive tactics.<ref name="Dark Lord 7" /> His training came successful for him as he killed many Mon Calamari during the occupation of Mon Cala.<ref name="Dark Lord 14" /> His life surpassed the Tenth Brother, who failed to hold off the Inquisitor Troopers when they were turned against them.<ref name="Dark Lord 17" /> He showed very little in the way of his [[Force power|powers]] and abilities during his hunt for a Force-sensitive child on Thabeska, as well as his confrontation with Ahsoka Tano. Tano described him as "lacking finesse" and "relying mostly on brute strength," as well as being apparently unable to fight with his helmet's blast shield down. Despite this, he was able to both deflect blaster bolts back at their firers and throw his saber in order to chop Kolvin in half,<ref name="Ahsoka" /> when on Mon Cala he also did this to a disciple named Daren.<ref name="Dark Lord 16" />

==Equipment==
{{Quote|Was he talented? Or does he just carry the lightsaber for show?|Bail Organa|Ahsoka (novel)|Ahsoka}}
The Sixth Brother's lightsaber was a double-bladed spinning lightsaber which could be thrown like a boomerang. He wore a blue helmet which had a neck guard drooping down the back and a silver and black face shield that was always down to cover most of his face. The Sixth Brother's suit was silver and over it he wore black armor on the shins, upper chest and shoulders, and the forearms. He wore a black [[kama]] around his waist and his armor had red attachments around it.<ref name="Dark Lord 16" />

==Behind the scenes==
The Sixth Brother first appeared as the primary antagonist of the novel ''[[Ahsoka (novel)|Ahsoka]]''.<ref name="Ahsoka" /> He was first pictured in ''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 6: The Chosen One, Part VI]]'', although it was not confirmed that Inquisitor was him<ref name="Dark Lord 6" /> until ''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 7: The Dying Light, Part I]]''.<ref name="Dark Lord 7" /> In ''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 16: Burning Seas, Part IV]]'', the Sixth Brother and Ninth Sister's former names are revealed to be Bil Valen and Masana Tide, although the comic does not specify which character had which name.<ref name="Dark Lord 16" />
