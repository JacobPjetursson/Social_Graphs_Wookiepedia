[[File:Zev-hd.png|thumb|left|250px|Zev Senesca locates Han Solo and Luke Skywalker.]]
Zev Senesca was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] from [[Kestic Station]]. At some point, Senesca left Kestic Station<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" /> and resided on [[Uthura]], where he [[Hunting|hunted]] [[starwhale]]s.<ref name="SYWTBAJ">''[[The Empire Strikes Back: So You Want to Be a Jedi?]]''</ref> By the [[time]] of the [[Galactic Civil War]], Senesca had joined the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]], serving the [[Rebel Alliance Starfighter Corps]]. After joining the Alliance, he met [[Wedge Antilles]] and [[Derek Klivian|Hobbie]] whilst at one of [[General]] [[Hera Syndulla]]'s training exercises.<ref name="Star Wars 45">''[[Star Wars 45: Mutiny at Mon Cala, Part II]]''</ref>

Eventually Senesca became a [[pilot]] of [[Rogue Squadron]].<ref name="SYWTBAJ" />

In [[3 ABY]],<ref name="Galactic Atlas" /> Senesca was among the Rebels stationed at [[Echo Base]] on the [[Water|ice]]-[[planet]] of [[Hoth]], where he flew a [[T-47 airspeeder]] under the [[callsign]] of [[Rogue Two]]. When [[Rogue Leader]] [[Luke Skywalker]] went missing during a patrol, [[Captain]] [[Han Solo]] went in search of him. The following morning, Senesca led Rogue Squadron and located the two missing [[officer]]s.<ref name="ESB" />

Soon after, the [[Galactic Empire]] discovered Echo Base, and the Rebel Alliance began an evacuation. During the subsequent [[Battle of Hoth]], Senesca piloted his snowspeeder,<ref name="ESB" /> with [[Kit Valent]] serving as his [[gunner]].<ref name="Complete Locations">''[[Star Wars: Complete Locations (2016)|Star Wars: Complete Locations]]''</ref> While defending Echo Base from Imperial [[All Terrain Armored Transport]]s, Senesca's snowspeeder was shot down, and both he and Valent were [[Death|killed]].<ref name="ESB" />

==Behind the scenes==
Zev Senesca was created for the [[1980]] film [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']], in which he was portrayed by actor [[Christopher Malcolm]]. The film's credits identified the character as "Zev,"<ref name="ESB" /> and the surname of "Senesca" was later [[canon]]ized in ''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]'', a [[2015]] reference book.<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" />

According to ''Ultimate Star Wars'', Senesca hailed from Kestic Station.<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" /> However, the 2015 junior novel ''[[The Empire Strikes Back: So You Want to Be a Jedi?]]'' states that Uthura is his [[homeworld]],<ref name="SYWTBAJ" /> and a cohesive timeline from [[Lucasfilm Ltd.|Lucasfilm]] has yet to be determined.
