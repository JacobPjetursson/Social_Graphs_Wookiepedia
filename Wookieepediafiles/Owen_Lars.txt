{{Quote|I'm not ''stupid'', Kenobi. Just because I haven't flown across the galaxy like you have doesn't make me some sort of ignorant hick.|Owen Lars, to Obi-Wan Kenobi|Star Wars 15: From the Journals of Old Ben Kenobi}}
'''Owen Lars''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] [[moisture farmer]] from the [[desert]] [[planet]] [[Tatooine]]. He was the son of [[Aika Lars|Aika]] and [[Cliegg Lars]], and he became the stepbrother of [[Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker]] when Cliegg [[Marriage|remarried]] to Anakin's mother [[Shmi Skywalker Lars|Shmi Skywalker]], a former [[Slavery|slave]]. When Shmi was [[Death|killed]] by [[Tusken Raider]]s and Cliegg passed away soon after, Lars was left responsible for his [[Lars moisture farm|family's farm]]. Around that [[time]], Lars married his girlfriend, [[Beru Whitesun Lars|Beru Whitesun]], and they toiled to maintain the homestead.

Three [[Standard year|years]] later, Lars' stepbrother betrayed the [[Jedi Order]] and became the [[Sith Lord]] [[Darth]] Vader. At that time, Lars and his wife were given custody of Skywalker's son, [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]], by Skywalker's [[Jedi Master]], [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]. The Jedi told Lars that Skywalker had been killed, and the [[farm]]er grew to resent Kenobi, believing he was responsible for his stepbrother's death. Fearing that the younger Skywalker would share a similar fate, Lars forbade Kenobi from seeing the boy, and he kept his nephew busy with work on the farm.

Shortly after the start of the [[Galactic Civil War]], Lars and Skywalker purchased the [[droid]] [[R2-D2]], who, unbeknownst to them, possessed stolen [[Death Star plans|plans]] for the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]], an [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] [[superweapon]] capable of destroying planets. Seeking to retrieve the data, Imperial [[stormtrooper]]s tracked the droid to Lars' homestead, where they interrogated and murdered him and his wife. When Skywalker found his family had been killed, he left Tatooine with Kenobi to train as a [[Jedi]], joining the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] and destroying the Death Star in the [[Battle of Yavin]].

==Biography==
===Early life and tragedy===

Owen Lars was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] born to the kind-[[heart]]ed [[moisture farmer]] [[Cliegg Lars]]<ref name="SWE Cliegg Lars">{{SWE|characters|cliegglars|Cliegg Lars}}</ref> and his [[Marriage|wife]], [[Aika Lars|Aika]], after they met on a bustling [[Core Worlds|Core World]]. When Aika died, the [[Parent|father]] and son traveled to Cliegg's [[homeworld]], the [[desert]] [[planet]] of [[Tatooine]],<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" /> where they lived on the [[Lars moisture farm|Lars family's homestead]] near the [[City|township]] of [[Anchorhead]].<ref name="SWE Cliegg Lars" /> As a young man, Lars had a strong vision of who he wanted to become, believing that he should be rooted on Tatooine and focused on improving the homestead.<ref name="SWE" /> Sometime after the [[Standard year|year]] [[32 BBY]],<ref name="Galactic Atlas" /> Cliegg went to [[Mos Espa]] in search of a new farmhand, and he met [[Shmi Skywalker Lars|Shmi Skywalker]],<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" /> a [[Slavery|slave]] owned by the [[Toydarian]] junk dealer [[Watto]]. Cliegg fell in love with Shmi, so he purchased her, set her free, and married her. Lars loved his stepmother very much, but he saw her sadness whenever she thought of her son, [[Anakin Skywalker]],<ref name="SWE" /> who had left Tatooine to join the [[Jedi Order]] on [[Coruscant]].<ref name="Episode I">[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']]</ref> Seeing his mother's sadness made Lars wonder how anyone could have left her behind.<ref name="SWE" /> In the following years, the family lived quietly,<ref name="SWE Cliegg Lars" /> and at some point, during a trip to Anchorhead, Lars met [[Beru Whitesun Lars|Beru Whitesun]], a third-generation moisture farmer. The two fell in love and began dating.<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" />

[[File:Lars-family.png|thumb|left|300px|The Lars family tells Anakin Skywalker about Shmi's abduction.]]
However, the peace was broken in [[22 BBY]],<ref name="Galactic Atlas" /> when one morning, Shmi was attacked and abducted by [[Tusken Raider]]s. Furious,<ref name="SWE Cliegg Lars" /> Lars' father rallied 29 other moisture farmers to help search for her. When the group returned, there were only four survivors, including Cliegg, who had lost a [[Limb|leg]] and was confined to a [[repulsorlift chair]]. As [[time]] passed, Lars and his father had little hope for Shmi's survival. A [[Standard month|month]] later, Skywalker returned to Tatooine after a ten year absence to look for his mother. He found that she had been sold to Cliegg, so he, along with [[Senator]] [[Padmé Amidala]], visited the homestead. Lars introduced himself and Whitesun to the visitors, and when Skywalker asked about Shmi, Cliegg introduced himself, inviting the Jedi inside to talk. Cliegg told the [[Jedi]] about Shmi's kidnapping, telling the Jedi that she was [[Death|dead]].<ref name="Episode II" /> Refusing to believe his stepfather, Skywalker borrowed Lars' [[swoop]] and tracked the Tusken Raiders.<ref name="SWE" />

The next [[Standard day|day]], Skywalker returned with Shmi's corpse. The [[Lars family]] buried Shmi outside their home and held a quiet funeral.<ref name="SWE Cliegg Lars" /> Following the funeral, Skywalker and Amidala left, and Lars never saw them again. Lars' father was determined to continue the life he worked hard to create,<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" /> but the tragedy weakened Cliegg, and he died soon after<ref name="SWE Cliegg Lars" /> of a broken heart,<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" /> leaving his farm and traditions to Lars.<ref name="SWE Cliegg Lars" /> Soon after, Lars and Whitesun married, and together they toiled to maintain the farm.<ref name="SWE" /> Owen and Beru decided to have a child, but problems of infertility precluded them to have one, leading them to consider seeing one of the [[fertility droid]]s at [[Mos Eisley]].<ref name="BWL:FaCPoV">{{Shortstory|story=Beru Whitesun Lars (short story)|sformatted=Beru Whitesun Lars|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>

[[File:Owen-Beru-sunset.png|thumb|right|300px|Beru and Owen Lars hold the infant Luke Skywalker and watch Tatooine's binary sunset.]]
In [[19 BBY]],<ref name="Galactic Atlas" /> Lars and his wife were contacted by [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], the [[Jedi Master]] who had trained Skywalker. The Jedi claimed that Skywalker had been killed, and he tasked the couple with protecting Skywalker's orphaned son, [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]].<ref name="Star Wars 15">''[[Star Wars 15: From the Journals of Old Ben Kenobi]]''</ref> Although Lars was initially reluctant, Beru convinced him to adopt the child.<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" /> When Kenobi arrived at the moisture farm, the Jedi presented Lars and Beru with the infant Skywalker, and the couple held their newly adopted child, watching the [[Binary star|binary sunset]] of Tatooine. Although Kenobi had claimed Skywalker was dead, Lars' stepbrother was alive. Skywalker had turned to the [[dark side of the Force]], betraying the Jedi Order and becoming the [[Sith Lord]] [[Darth]] Vader.<ref name="Episode III">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref> After delivering the child, Kenobi went into exile,<ref name="Episode III" /> changing his name to "Ben" and keeping watch over the young Skywalker.

===Raising Luke Skywalker===
{{Quote|I told you, I'm not gonna let you warp the boy like you did his father. You brought him to me to protect, and that's what I'm doing. Protecting him from ''you''.''"<br />"''I'm not asking to train the boy. You've made yourself quite clear on that matter. But Luke has potential to be something&hellip;truly remarkable.

Haven't you murdered ''enough'' Skywalkers already, Kenobi?|Lars and Obi-Wan Kenobi|Star Wars 15: From the Journals of Old Ben Kenobi}}
Around [[11 BBY]],<ref name="Jordan White">{{Twitter|cracksh0t|status/626888339249991680|[[Jordan D. White]]|quote=he looks like 8ish to me.|image=File:From the Journals Tweet.png}}</ref> Tatooine was plagued by the [[Great Drought]], which halted [[water]] collection for moisture farmers. During the drought, [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]], the [[Hutt]] [[crime lord]] of Tatooine, declared a [[water tax]], and he had his enforcers take the farmers' harvests, sometimes by force. However, unknown to Lars, Kenobi was protecting the Lars homestead from Jabba's thugs, so the family was never forced to pay. Still, the drought continued to worsen, and one night, Skywalker left the moisture farm to steal water from the Hutt's thugs. When Lars and Beru realized that Skywalker was missing, they searched for the boy, but they were unable to find him. Kenobi, however, sensed that Skywalker was in danger, and the Jedi found and rescued the boy, bringing him back to the homestead. In the morning, Beru found Skywalker, and called for her husband. Lars rushed to Skywalker's side, asking if he was all right. Skywalker, was unharmed, but he was unable to recall any of the previous night's events. About a [[Standard week|week]] later, the drought lifted, and the [[moisture vaporator]]s began collecting water again.<ref name="Star Wars 7">''[[Star Wars 7: From the Journals of Old Ben Kenobi: The Last of His Breed|Star Wars 7: From the Journals of Old Ben Kenobi: "The Last of His Breed"]]''</ref>

[[File:Owen confronts Kenobi.png|thumb|left|300px|Fearing that Kenobi will lead to Skywalker's death, Lars tells the Jedi to stay away from the boy.]]
In [[10 BBY]],<ref name="Jordan White" /> a year after the Great Drought's end, Skywalker took interest in [[pilot]]ing his family's [[T-16 skyhopper]], and during one adventurous flight, Skywalker became overconfident in his abilities, wrecking the skyhopper in [[Beggar's Canyon]]. Lars grounded Skywalker, enraged that they were short a speeder and could not afford repairs. When Skywalker suggested entering a race at Anchorhead and using prize money, Lars rejected the idea, telling Skywalker that he would never fly again. In the following days, Lars and Skywalker went to a market to purchase an [[astromech droid]] and a [[droid]] capable of speaking [[Bocce]]. While Lars was looking at droids, Skywalker was approached by two [[Jawa]]s, who handed him a box filled with the parts needed to repair the skyhopper. Skywalker believed it was a gift from his uncle, and the boy thanked him and rushed off; in actuality, the parts were from Kenobi, who believed that Skywalker needed more practice piloting. However, Lars immediately realized that Kenobi had interfered, also recalling the unusual absence of Tusken Raiders and Hutt thugs at the homestead. Furious, Lars visited [[Ben Kenobi's home|Kenobi's home]], bringing the skyhopper parts with him. Reasserting that he did not want Kenobi's help, Lars told the hermit to leave Skywalker alone, saying it was his own job to protect Skywalker, and that the Jedi was whom Skywalker needed protection from.<ref name="Star Wars 15" />

Soon after, Lars purchased skyhoppper parts at [[Tosche Station]], hoping to fix the speeder with Skywalker and amend their strained relationship. However, when Lars returned home, the farmer was attacked by [[Black Krrsantan]], a [[Wookiee]] [[bounty hunter]] searching for the man who had defied Jabba's tax collectors the year before. Krrsantan took Lars to a clifftop near the [[Dune Sea]], where the Wookiee [[Stuncuffs|cuffed]] and beat the farmer with an electric baton, hoping to elicit a scream. Lars begged Krrsantan to stop, saying that he could not understand the [[Shyriiwook|Wookiee's language]] and was unable to answer his questions. The bounty hunter continued to attack until Kenobi appeared atop the cliff, revealing himself to be the man marked for [[bounty]]. Krrsantan immediately attacked Kenobi, quickly snaring the Jedi in a [[stun net]]. While Krrsantan's back was turned, Lars charged, but the Wookiee knocked him back, sending the farmer over the cliff edge. Lars caught himself on a protrusion from the cliff, hanging on as Kenobi summoned [[Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber (Jedi Master)|his lightsaber]], cutting the net and reengaging the Wookiee. Kenobi knocked the Wookiee over with [[the Force]] and turned his attention to rescuing Lars.<ref name="Star Wars 20">''[[Star Wars 20: From the Journals of Old Ben Kenobi]]''</ref>

[[File:Owen-and-Luke.png|thumb|right|300px|Safe from the bounty hunter, Lars is reunited with Skywalker.]]
However, Krrsantan quickly stood back up, grabbing a boulder and preparing to kill his target. Kenobi sliced the boulder in half, but one chunk fell and broke the rock which had been supporting Lars. The farmer began to fall, but he was saved by Kenobi, who held him through the Force. Kenobi struggled to concentrate on holding Lars and fending off the Wookiee, and the Jedi lost his grip on the farmer, who began to plummet toward the ground. As Lars fell, however, Skywalker&mdash;who had repaired the skyhopper and went in search of his captured uncle&mdash;arrived, catching him on one of the skyhopper's [[cannon]]s. Skywalker landed the skyhopper and apologized, and Lars embraced his nephew, looking up to see Kenobi standing victorious on the clifftop. After the event, Lars and Kenobi never spoke, and they both happily returned to their homes.<ref name="Star Wars 20" />

===Final days===
{{Quote|You know, I think that R2 unit we bought may have been stolen.''"<br />"''What makes you think that?''"<br />"''Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says that he belongs to someone named Obi-Wan Kenobi. I thought he might have meant old Ben.

Now, tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit to Anchorhead and have its memory erased. That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now.|Luke Skywalker and Lars|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}
[[File:Lars-buys-C3PO.png|thumb|left|300px|Lars and Skywalker purchase C-3PO from Jawas.]]
In [[0 BBY]], shortly after the start of the [[Galactic Civil War]],<ref name="Galactic Atlas" /> a company of Jawas came by the homestead to sell miscellaneous droids. Lars, requiring an astromech droid and a droid capable of programming moisture vaporators, settled on purchasing the astromech droid [[R5-D4]] and the [[protocol droid]] [[C-3PO]], respectively. With the droids selected, Lars told Skywalker to clean them, despite the boy's plans of going to Tosche Station with his friends. However, Skywalker discovered that the [[R5 unit]] had a bad [[motivator]], and he informed his uncle. At the suggestion of C-3PO, Lars bought the astromech droid [[R2-D2]] in place of R5-D4.<ref name="Episode IV" />

Later, while Skywalker was cleaning R2-D2, he discovered a [[Hologram|holographic]] message for "Obi-Wan Kenobi." Wondering if the droid was referring to Ben Kenobi, Skywalker asked his uncle during dinner. Lars replied that Kenobi was just a crazy old wizard, telling Skywalker to take the droid to Anchorhead and have its memory [[Memory wipe|erased]]. When Skywalker asked about the possibility of "Obi-Wan" coming to look for the droid, Lars denied the thought, telling Skywalker that the man had died around the same time as his father. The mention of his father piqued Skywalker's interest, and he asked if the man had known his father. Lars told Skywalker to forget it, telling his nephew to take care of the droids by morning. Thinking the droids would provide extra help on the farm, Skywalker, who desired to enroll in the [[Imperial Academy]] like his friends, asked Lars if he could join that year. Fearing that Skywalker was too much like his father, Lars denied his nephew's wish, stating that his help was still needed and that he could enroll in the following year. Disappointed, Skywalker left, leaving Lars and Beru to discuss if and when to let him join.<ref name="Episode IV" />

[[File:Owen-Beru-burned.png|thumb|right|300px|The deaths of Lars and Beru prompted Skywalker to join the Rebellion.]]
When the morning came, Lars could not find his nephew, so he asked his wife if she knew where he was. Beru believed that Skywalker was doing chores, but in actuality, Skywalker was searching for R2-D2, who had run off in search of Kenobi. Unknown to Lars, R2-D2 was carrying stolen [[Death Star plans|plans]] of the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]], the [[Galactic Empire]]'s recently completed [[superweapon]] capable of destroying entire planets. Imperial [[stormtrooper]]s, desperate to reclaim the data, traced the droid to the Lars homestead, where they proceeded to interrogate Lars and Beru. Failing to acquire the plans, the stormtroopers killed the couple, burning the home and leaving.<ref name="Databank Owen Lars" /> When Skywalker returned, finding his family murdered and home in ruins, he decided to leave Tatooine with Kenobi and train to become a [[Jedi Knight]] like his father. The pair traveled to the [[Mos Eisley]] [[spaceport]], where they met [[Han Solo]], a [[smuggler]] who agreed to take them to the planet [[Alderaan]] aboard the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''.<ref name="Episode IV" />

===Legacy===

The deaths of Lars and Beru prompted Skywalker to leave Tatooine with Kenobi and join the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. Upon joining the Rebels, Skywalker fought in the [[Battle of Yavin]], destroying the Death Star and becoming a Rebellion hero.<ref name="Episode IV" /> Even beyond the realm of the living, Owen's wife Beru speculated that perhaps if Owen had allowed to let Luke leave Tatooine sooner they could be still alive, but she ended up resting comfortably acknowledging what heroic actions Luke made after their deaths.<ref name="BWL:FaCPoV" /> Despite the recent loss of his family, Skywalker did not grieve until soon after the battle, when his love interest, [[Nakari Kelen]], was killed on the planet [[Omereth]]. Kelen's death provided Skywalker a moment to consider his losses, and he wept upon thinking of his aunt and uncle.<ref name="Heir to the Jedi">''[[Heir to the Jedi]]''</ref>

Skywalker later returned to Tatooine to recover [[The Journals of Ben Kenobi|Kenobi's journal]], which contained stories of the Jedi's few encounters with the Lars family.<ref name="Star Wars 7" /> In the weeks after the Battle of Yavin, Darth Vader searched for the pilot responsible for destroying the Death Star, discovering that the pilot was the son he never knew he had. Vader, accompanied by [[Doctor]] [[Chelli Lona Aphra]], revisited the abandoned homestead and followed Skywalker's trail. While assessing the destruction, Aphra speculated that Skywalker might have never left Tatooine, had his family been spared.<ref name="Darth Vader 7">''[[Darth Vader 7: Shadows and Secrets, Part I]]''</ref>

As Luke never liked Lars' moisture farm and didn't want to become a farmer, he eventually became a Jedi Knight like his father before him and eventually a Jedi Master following the [[Battle of Jakku|end]] of the Galactic Empire. However, after the [[Destruction of Luke Skywalker's Jedi Temple|destruction]] of his [[Jedi Order#A new generation|Jedi students]] at the hands of his nephew [[Kylo Ren|Ben Solo]], Luke went into [[Exile (punishment)|exile]] and temporarily became a farmer on the legendary planet of [[Ahch-To]].<ref name="TLJVD">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> In [[34 ABY]], before the Force-sensitive [[scavenger]] [[Rey]]'s coming to Ahch-To, Skywalker had a [[dream]] about an alternate life where he ignored Organa's message and never joined the rebellion, remaining in the moisture farming business with Owen and getting married to his friend [[Camie Marstrap]]. In his dream, Skywalker never went to search for Kenobi and stormtroopers came to take back C-3PO and R2-D2. Owen also was taken by the stormtroopers to be interrogated, but released three days later, though remained silent and pale during the long ride back from Mos Eisley.<ref name="TLJ:EE">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: Expanded Edition]]''</ref>

Lars was a male human with [[Color|light]] skin and blue [[eye]]s, and he stood at a height of 1.7 [[meter]]s (5 [[Foot|feet]], 7 [[inch]]es). He had dark brown [[hair]] in his youth, and it turned gray with age.<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" /> The son of Cliegg, Lars was raised in the traditions of discipline and hard work.

Feeling great disdain towards the Jedi Order, Lars believed that Kenobi had warped Anakin's mind<ref name="Star Wars 15" /> into leaving Shmi on Tatooine, an act he considered to be unimaginable.<ref name="SWE" /> Lars also held Kenobi responsible for the deaths of Shmi and Anakin (whom was believed to have died), believing that the Jedi's actions had torn the family apart.<ref name="Star Wars 15" /> When Kenobi left Skywalker under Lars' reluctant protection,<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" /> the farmer told the Jedi to stay away from them, fearing that Kenobi would create similar consequences with the boy.<ref name="Star Wars 15" /> Despite his feelings about Kenobi, Lars helped him fight the Wookiee Krrsantan, which the Jedi viewed as an act of bravery.<ref name="Star Wars 20" /> To keep Skywalker out of trouble, Lars kept his nephew's Jedi lineage a secret, claiming that Skywalker's father was simply a [[navigator]] on a [[spice]] [[freighter]].<ref name="SWE" /> When Luke desired to leave Tatooine, Lars found it difficult to ignore his gruff, protective attitude, which had become a habit over the years.<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" />

In [[2015]], a [[Wikipedia:Korea|Korean]] [[webcomic]] by [[Hong Jac Ga]] simply titled ''[[Star Wars (LINE Webtoon)|Star Wars]]'' adapted the [[original trilogy]], beginning with the events leading into ''A New Hope''. The comic features Lars in its first four chapters: "An Old Friend," "Meeting the Droids," "Beginning of an Adventure," and "Only Hope." Chapters one and two involve an original story set during Skywalker's childhood, beginning in [[12 BBY]] and jumping forward to [[6 BBY]]. The third, fourth chapters adapt early scenes from ''A New Hope''.<ref name="LINE Webtoon">[[Star Wars (LINE Webtoon)|''Star Wars'' LINE Webtoon]]</ref> Due to cultural leeway, the comic is canonically in a "grey area."<ref name="Jennifer Heddle">{{Twitter|jenniferheddle|status/604430151309365249|[[Jennifer Heddle]]|quote=It is approved but its canon status is grey area. We gave them leeway for cultural interpretation|image=File:LINE Webtoon Tweet.png}}</ref>

The story begins when Skywalker is seven years old, and Lars finds him alone, planning to watch a [[meteor shower]]. Fearing that Skywalker could have been attacked by Tusken Raiders, Lars scolds Skywalker and then argues with Beru, saying he'll keep the boy occupied with more chores. The following morning, Lars tells Skywalker that he cannot protect him all the time, and that he will teach him the safety basics of the farm. Then, to Beru and Skywalker's surprise, Lars says he will show him how to use a [[blaster]] rifle. Although Beru feels Skywalker is too young, Lars teaches his excited nephew.<ref name="An Old Friend">[[Star Wars (LINE Webtoon)|''Star Wars'' LINE Webtoon]]: Chapter 1&mdash;"An Old Friend"</ref>

Six years later, Lars is proud of Skywalker's hard work, and Beru compares the boy to his father. Refusing to discuss Skywalker's father any further, Lars tells Beru that the boy is like a son to him. Lars states that he does not want Skywalker to experience war in his lifetime, so he will not let him join the Imperial Academy. Later that day, Skywalker and his friend Windy get lost in a [[sandstorm]], and they encounter a [[krayt dragon]].<ref name="An Old Friend" /> The two boys are saved by Kenobi, who takes them back home. Lars thanks Kenobi for bringing Skywalker back safely, but tells the Jedi to stay away from the boy. In return, Kenobi says he is observing Skywalker, claiming that the Force is strong in him, and that he will leave the farm one day. Lars responds by saying that the Jedi went extinct with the [[Galactic Republic]], warning Kenobi to never visit the homestead again.<ref name="Meeting the Droids">[[Star Wars (LINE Webtoon)|''Star Wars'' LINE Webtoon]]: Chapter 2&mdash;"Meeting the Droids"</ref>
