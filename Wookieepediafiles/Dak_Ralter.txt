Before the battle, he was very excited to work with [[Luke Skywalker]], the hero he had heard so much about.<ref name="Lost Stars">''[[Lost Stars]]''</ref> He served as Skywalker's [[gunner]] and [[Death|died]] in the battle. Shortly after his death, their snowspeeder was shot down and crash landed in front of an AT-AT.
