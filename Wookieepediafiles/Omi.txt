{{Quote|Who will I be the next time around?|Omi's final thoughts|The Baptist}}
'''Omi''' was a [[Force-sensitive]] [[Sexes|female]] [[dianoga]] which lived inside [[garbage masher 3263827]] aboard the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]].

==Description==
Omi, like other [[dianoga]], was a [[Sentience|sentient]]<ref name="The Baptist" /> [[Diet|carnivorous]]<ref name="Databank" /> [[cephalopod]]<ref name="Join the Resistance">''[[Join the Resistance]]''</ref> which possessed multiple [[heart]]s,<ref name="The Baptist" /> seven suckered [[Limb|tentacles]], and a single [[eye]]stalk protruding from the center of their bodies.<ref name="Join the Resistance" /> She had purple skin which could change color to match her surroundings,<ref name="The Baptist" /> and a green eye with red sclera.<ref name="Episode IV" /> Omi was also 10.0 [[meter]]s tall.<ref name="Databank" />

==History==
{{Quote|There's something alive in here.|Luke Skywalker|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}
Sometime before the [[Battle of Yavin]], Omi got into an altercation with [[Iduna]], a [[Sexes|male]] member of her [[species]], who had wanted to exchange [[egg]]s. Because of her [[Force-sensitive|Force-sensitivity]] she was able to defeat Iduna.<ref name="The Baptist" />

Sometime later, she was captured on her [[Vodran|homeworld]] by the native [[Vodran (species)|Vodran]], who handed Omi to [[Galactic Empire|Imperials]] en route to the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]]. While en route to the DS-1 Orbital [[Battle station|Battle Station]], she received a [[Force vision|vision]] of [[Battle of Yavin|fiery destruction]] and was able to escape her containment. She attempted to flee the [[Starship|vessel]] by making use of her species' natural ability to camouflage, but was discovered by two Imperial [[stormtrooper]]s. Although she was able to dispatch the two stormtroopers, by surrendering herself to the power of what she could only describe as "[[The Force|It]]," she realised that there was nowhere to go, and retreated back into her containment, until finally arriving to the Death Star.<ref name="The Baptist" />

Once aboard, Omi once again received a vision of [[fire]], and was dumped into a [[Garbage compactor|garbage chute]], introducing her to [[garbage masher 3263827]], where she would feed on the organic materials that would fall in. After [[Rescue of Princess Leia|rescuing]] [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Organa]] aboard the [[Death]] [[Star]], [[Han Solo]], [[Chewbacca]] and [[Luke Skywalker]] were temporarily stranded<ref name="Episode IV" /> inside garbage masher 3263827,<ref name="Ep IV Read-Along">''[[Episode IV: A New Hope Read-Along Storybook and CD]]''</ref> along with the Princess<ref name="Episode IV" /> in the [[Standard year|year]] [[0 BBY]].<ref name="GA">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]''</ref> Enacting the belief of her people, Omi pulled Skywalker into the [[water]], "baptizing" him, after she felt that he too was in "submission to It," and letting him go shortly thereafter.<ref name="The Baptist" /> As the compression cycle was about to start, the dianoga disappeared deep underwater.<ref name="Episode IV" /> When Luke Skywalker was able to escape the trash compactor unharmed, Omi sensed that he would go on to do great things.<ref name="The Baptist" />

Before the Death Star's destruction, Omi would continue to develop in her submission to "It," being able to [[Telepathy|telepathically]] lift objects into the air. When her vision was fulfilled, and the Death Star was destroyed, she pondered what she would be in the next life.<ref name="The Baptist" />

==Behind the scenes==
Omi, and the dianoga [[species]], first appeared in the original [[1977]] film [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']], the first installment of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[original trilogy]].<ref name="Episode IV" /> [[Nnedi Okorafor]], writer of the short story "[[The Baptist]]" for the anthology ''[[From a Certain Point of View]]'', revealed Omi's name in a preview for her short story on [[September 16]], [[2017]].<ref name="Nnedi">{{Twitter|Nnedi|status/909083514196312064|[[Nnedi Okorafor]]|quote=This is out Oct 5th. I've given the trash compactor monster from a New Hope a story. ðŸ¦‘Now you'll know how she got there. #operationbluemilk|image=}}</ref> Okorafor stated that she named the dianoga Omi, as Omi means "water" in [[Wikipedia:Yoruba language|Yoruba language]].<ref name="Interview">{{SW|url=news/nnedi-okorafor-dianoga-from-a-certain-point-of-view|text=Nnedi Okorafor on Giving the Dianoga a Soul in ''From a Certain Point of View''}}</ref>

In [[George Lucas]]' revised fourth draft of ''A New Hope'', Omi, or more specifically the Dianoga, was referred as "Dia Nogu", in reference to the earlier drafts, in which the Jedi were called "Dai Nogas" or just "Dai". The early scripts of the film didn't always have Omi's presence nor the trash compactor scene. In the finished version of film, Lucas was reportedly less than impressed with the delivered Dianoga effect, having envisioned something bigger and more ominous.<ref name="Former DB">{{DB|creature|dianoga|Dianoga}}</ref>

In [[2015]], [[Chuck Wendig]], author of the novel ''[[Aftermath]]'', expressed interest in potentially writing stories about [[Malakili]], [[Chirpa|Chief Chirpa]] or Omi. However, he ultimately chose to write about Malakili instead in his sequel novel ''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]''.<ref name="Chuck Wendig's War">{{InsiderCite|160|Chuck Wendig's War}}</ref>
