==Behind the scenes==
Ruwee Naberrie was portrayed by [[Graeme Blundell]] in [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']] and [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']].<ref name="IMDb">{{Imdb|url=name/nm0089882/|text=Graeme Blundell}}</ref><ref name="Ruwee Databank" >[https://web.archive.org/web/20100209213438/http://starwars.com/databank/character/ruweenaberrie/index.html Ruwee Naberrie] in the [[Databank (original)|Databank]]</ref>

During the filming of ''Attack of the Clones'', Blundell traveled to [[Lake Como]], [[Wikipedia:Italy|Italy]] in order to shoot his scenes as Ruwee Naberrie,<ref name="Ruwee Databank" /> but all his scenes were deleted from the film's final cut. His scenes at the end of ''Revenge of the Sith'', however, remained unchanged and make it into the finished version of the film.

Ruwee's card from the digital card game ''[[Star Wars: Force Collection]]'' erroneously lists him as [[Qui-Gon Jinn]]'s father.<ref name="Force Collection" />
