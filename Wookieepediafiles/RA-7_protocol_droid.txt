{{Quote|I can't believe I'm the same model as that Imperial drone.|AP-5, on [[PZ-7]]|Double Agent Droid}}
The '''RA-7 protocol droid''', also known as the '''RA-7 [[inventory droid]]''', the '''RA-7 series protocol droid''' and nicknamed the "'''Death Star droid'''" due to its use aboard the first [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]], was a model of [[protocol droid]] manufactured by [[Arakyd Industries]]. Produced specially for the [[Galactic Empire]], RA-7s were almost always used as [[Spy|spies]].

==Characteristics==
{{Quote|There are some credits in it for you if you bring me the head of an Imperial RA-7 protocol droid. The optics on those are supposed to be ''magnificent''.|[[Sevox]], to [[Zarro]]|Chewbacca, Part IV}}

==RA-7 protocol droids in the galaxy==
{{Quote|RA-7s are Death Star droids.''"<br />"''Um...well, yes, that's what some call them, though many RA-7s find it a derogatory term. Only a small percentage of that model actually worked on the Death Star.|[[Caluan Ematt]] and [[C-3PO]]|Poe Dameron: Flight Log}}
An RA-7 designated [[4-A7]] was used as a [[spy droid]] by the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] during the [[Clone Wars]].<ref name="The Clone Wars" />

An RA-7 designated [[AP-5]] served as an [[analyst droid]] for the [[Galactic Republic]] during the [[Battle of Ryloth|Ryloth campaign]]. Later, [[Sexes|he]] became an [[inventory droid]] for the [[Galactic Empire]] before defecting to the rebellion after having his [[restraining bolt]] removed by the rebel [[astromech droid]] [[C1-10P]].<ref name="The Forgotten Droid" />

[[Arakyd Industries]] later produced RA-7s specially for the Empire.<ref name="Updated and Expanded" /> Due to their use aboard the first [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]], some called RA-7s "Death Star droids," though many of them found it a derogatory term as only a small percentage of the model actually worked on the [[battle station]].<ref name="Flight Log" />

==Behind the scenes==
{{Quote|A lot of the other bits of the costume were See-Threepio concept work that wasn't used.|Brian Muir|Star Wars Costumes: The Original Trilogy}}
The RA-7 protocol droid was created for the [[1977]] film [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]. The costume built for the film was taken directly from an "elevator scene" production painting and other pencil quick sketches [[Ralph McQuarrie]] had done of the character. Two versions of the RA-7 were seen in the film: it first appeared in the [[Jawa]] [[sandcrawler]] with a reflective Steinart finish ([[3B6-RA-7]]) and a quick repaint allowed the same costume to be used later in the Death Star with a black finish ([[5D6-RA-7]]). Its torso as it appeared in the production painting would later inspire the design of the [[2-1B surgical droid]].<ref name="Costumes">''[[Star Wars Costumes: The Original Trilogy]]''</ref>

The RA-7's head was sculpted by [[Brian Muir]] and, with its large, insect-like eyes and bulbous cranium, it was one of his favorite designs from ''A New Hope''. The torso of the character was almost exactly like McQuarrie's designs, though it may have been done as concept art for [[C-3PO]]'s costume. It eventually had shoulder epaulets installed, with a functional joint identical to C-3PO's. The arms and legs were likewise similar to C-3PO's, though the aluminium arms lacked the elbow pistons and other detailing. The fiberglass legs were stripped of their sculpted detail lines to give this protocol droid a slightly different appearance. The costume's hands were simple gloves with metal-colored pltes applied to them, to give them a mechanical look.<ref name="Costumes" />

For the RA-7 protocol droid's appearance in the ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' animated series, its animation model -whose geometry was later updated by [[Chris Glenn]] to better match its design in ''A New Hope-''<ref name="Concept Art Gallery">{{SW|url=tv-shows/clone-wars/the-jedi-who-knew-too-much-concept-art-gallery|text=The Jedi Who Knew Too Much Concept Art Gallery}} {{C|Slide 3}}</ref> was identical to that of C-3PO, barring its head.<ref name="The Clone Wars" /> In ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' animated series, its design and proportions better match early McQuarrie's sketches of the droid, particularly its rounded shoulders.<ref name="Trivia Gallery">{{SW|url=tv-shows/star-wars-rebels/the-forgotten-droid-trivia-gallery|text=The Forgotten Droid Trivia Gallery}} {{C|Slide 3}}</ref>
