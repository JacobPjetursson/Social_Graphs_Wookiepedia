'''Rune Haako''' was a [[Sexes|male]] [[Neimoidian]] official of the [[Trade Federation|Trade Federation and]] a high ranking member of the [[Separatist Council]].

==Biography==
===Invasion of Naboo===
Rune Haako was [[Viceroy of the Trade Federation|Viceroy]] [[Nute Gunray]]'s right hand [[Sexes|man]], [[Settlement Officer]] and [[lieutenant]] during the [[Invasion of Naboo]]. He, Gunray and [[Daultay Dofine|Dofine]] schemed with the [[Sith Lord]] [[Darth Sidious]] in order to achieve greater profits. On Sidious's orders, the three made a [[blockade]] on [[Naboo]], because of the new taxation of the formerly [[Free Trade Zone]]s, and later invaded the [[planet]]. The [[Neimoidian]]s attempted to make [[Queen]] [[Padmé Amidala]] sign a treaty to make the invasion legal by threatening to starve the people of the planet, but she successfully escaped the planet. To ensure all went according to his plan, Sidious sent his [[Sith apprentice|apprentice]] Darth Maul to oversee the occupation and to keep an [[eye]] on the [[Trade Federation]] leadership, which greatly unnerved the naturally cowardly Neimoidians. Gunray held [[Governor]] [[Sio Bibble]] prisoner and [[OOM-9]] informed Gunray that they would soon draw out the [[Gungan]]s and [[Death|kill]] them. Gunray, Haako and Maul assured Sidious that the Federation will win and that Amidala would soon be forced to return in order to save her people. As they predicted, Amidala [[Battle of Naboo|returned]]. Unfortunately, Dofine perished and Gunray, Haako and [[Senator]] [[Lott Dod]] were sent to [[Coruscant]] on trial, but because they had many supporters and powerful partners they retained their positions.<ref name="Episode I" />

===Clone Wars===
[[File:Haako on Geonosis.jpg|thumb|left|220x220px|Viceroy Gunray, Settlement Officer Haako and Count Dooku on Geonosis.]]
During the [[Separatist Crisis]], Gunray, Haako and their partners from planets and corporations were invited to [[Geonosis]] by [[Count]] [[Dooku]], Sidious's new apprentice. Gunray and Haako pledged the Trade Federation's support to the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] and asked that in return Dooku kill Amidala, the Federation's most hated enemy. Gunray, Haako, Dooku and [[Archduke]] [[Poggle the Lesser]] oversaw the failed execution of [[Jedi Knight]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], his [[Padawan]] [[Anakin Skywalker]] and Amidala in the [[Petranaki arena]], who were saved by the [[Jedi]] and the new [[Grand Army of the Republic]]. The two Neimoidians joined the other [[Separatist Council]] members in the war room and saw with their own eyes the [[Battle of Geonosis|First Battle of Geonosis]] via [[hologram]]. Haako declared it vital that the Federation starships be launched before retreating in a [[Sheathipede-class transport shuttle|''Sheathipede''-class shuttle]].<ref name="Episode II" />

[[File:Haako pray for mercy from vader.JPG|thumb|220x220px|Haako begs for mercy from Darth Vader, moments before his death.]]
At the end of the war, the Separatist Council was called by [[General]] [[Grievous]] to [[Utapau]], following the [[Battle of Coruscant|death]] of Dooku, and were sent to [[Mustafar]] where they resided up until the end of the war. Promised a great reward by Lord Sidious, Haako and the others waited greedily for it to arrive, unaware that they were in fact to be [[Mission to Mustafar|killed]] by [[Darth]] Vader, on Sidious's orders. When Vader arrived, he proceeded to do just that, cutting down all in his path. At one point, Haako pleaded with the Sith Lord to cease the massacre, to no avail, and retreated into the conference room with [[Wat Tambor]] as Vader cut down [[Rute Gunnay]] before his eyes. This, however, did little more than delay their deaths by a few seconds and Vader killed both Haako and Tambor in quick succession, leaving only Gunray to fall moments after.<ref name="Episode III" />

==Behind the scenes==
Rune Haako was played by [[Jerome Blake]] and voiced by [[James Taylor]] in ''[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]''.<ref name="Episode I" /> In ''[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'', he was played by [[Alan Ruscoe]] and voiced by [[Chris Truswell]] (despite the credits identifying him as [[Lott Dod]]),<ref name="Episode II" /> and played by [[Sandy Thompson]] in ''[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]''.<ref name="Episode III" />

After filming for ''The Phantom Menace'' wrapped, Haako's mask was lost, resulting in the production crew giving [[Daultay Dofine]]'s mask to Ruscoe instead, and for a time it was thought that this "new" Neimoidian would become a separate character named [[Gilramos Libkath]].<ref name="hcb">''[http://blogs.starwars.com/holocron/29 Keeper of the Holocron's Blog]''</ref>

Though Haako's death is never actually shown on screen, [[Ben Burtt]]'s editing places another character's death right after we see him on camera, leading the audience to believe that this character was him dying at that particular moment. The audience could see him saying "Stop, No!" (that was definitely him) but right after that the editing cuts to [[Rute Gunnay]] being struck down. Haako's body can later be seen in the conference room.<ref name="Episode III" />
