'''Morley''' was a [[Sexes|male]] [[Anacondan]] native to [[Lotho Minor]] who lived during the [[Clone Wars]]. Morley helped provide the former [[Sith Lord]] [[Maul|Darth Maul]] with food in his exile in return for the "leftovers." Morley later encountered Maul's brother, [[Savage Opress]], whom the Anacondan tricked into finding Maul without realizing that Opress intended to in fact find and help his brother. When Morley found that Maul had not [[Death|killed]] Opress, he retreated from the scene. However, before he could escape, Opress grabbed Morley by the neck and strangled him. He then threw Morley's corpse into a fire out of anger.<ref name="Brothers" />
