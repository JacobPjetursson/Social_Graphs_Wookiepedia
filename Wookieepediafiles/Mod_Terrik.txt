'''Mod Terrik''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Sexes/Legends|male]] [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Imperial]] [[captain/Legends|officer]] of the [[Desert Sands]] [[Desert stormtrooper|sandtrooper]] unit. Fearless and highly motivated, Terrik was willing to sacrifice as many troops as he felt necessary in order to achieve his objectives. He was a master tactician and was known for the [[Death/Legends|deaths]] of hundreds of rebels.

==Biography==
When he was assigned to [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]] in search of missing [[Droid/Legends|droids]] [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]], Terrik was [[Captain/Legends|captain]] of the Desert Sands [[Zeta Squadron]]. He ordered and supervised attacks on a [[Jawa/Legends|Jawa]] [[Sandcrawler/Legends|sandcrawler]]. Following the tracks of sandcrawler, they soon moved to the [[Lars homestead]]. His troops captured [[Owen Lars/Legends|Owen Lars]] and [[Beru Whitesun Lars/Legends|Beru Whitesun Lars]], and [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] himself ordered them to be executed. They carried out this order and left shortly before [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] arrived at the Lars homestead.

Later Terrik was contacted by [[Garindan]], a spy working for the Imperials who had tracked C-3PO and R2-D2 to [[Docking Bay 94/Legends|Docking Bay 94]]. Terrik and his men arrived at Docking Bay 94 and engaged [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] outside the ''[[Millennium Falcon/Legends|Millennium Falcon]]'', but were unsuccessful in preventing his escape with his passengers. Amid the crossfire, Terrik was shot in the back and [[Death/Legends|killed]] by one of his own troopers, [[Davin Felth]].
