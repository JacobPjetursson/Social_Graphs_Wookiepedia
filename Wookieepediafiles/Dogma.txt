{{Quote|You ever think that maybe the General knows what he is doing?|Dogma, on General Pong Krell|Darkness on Umbara}}
"'''Dogma'''" was the nickname of a [[clone trooper]] who served in the [[501st Legion]] of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] during the [[Clone Wars]]. He was known to always follow orders. After being manipulated by [[Jedi Master]] and secret [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist]] agent [[Pong Krell]] during the [[Battle of Umbara]], Dogma [[Death|executed]] Krell to prevent him from revealing [[Galactic Republic|Republic]] military secrets.

==Biography==
[[File:JesseOnUmbara-DOU.jpg|left|thumb|202x202px|Dogma (right) with Jesse (left) and Tup (center) on Umbara]]
Around [[20 BBY]], Dogma was sent along with the [[501st Legion]] to [[Battle of Umbara|retake]] the planet [[Umbara]], whose [[Umbaran|native species]] had sided with the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. During the invasion, the republic forces were able to land, while suffering heavy casualties. Dogma and the 501st were commanded by General [[Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Captain Rex]]. Dogma, however, was only interested in completing the mission. However, after the 501st Legion had established a foothold in Umbaran soil and was permitted some time to rest, command was transferred from General Skywalker to General [[Pong Krell]], because Skywalker was called back to [[Coruscant]] at the request of both the Supreme Chancellor and the Jedi Council.<ref name="Darkness on Umbara" />

Like most other clone troopers, Dogma was absolutely obedient and willing to accept any order without question. Hence, he was as loyal to Krell's command as he was to Skywalker. A few of the clones however, like Rex and [[ARC-5555]], were skeptical of Krell's decision to conquer the [[Umbaran capital]] with a full-forward assault. Then, Umbaran forces ambushed the clones, forcing them to retreat from the path.<ref name="Darkness on Umbara" />  After that, the 501st under the command of Krell continued to engage the Umbarans in a heavy firefight. Just then, [[General Kenobi]] had contacted Krell, telling him that a nearby [[Umbaran airbase|airbase]] was resupplying the Umbarans. Krell then led the 501st Legion to take the base.<ref name="General">{{TCW|The General}}</ref>

After arriving at their destination, Captain Rex readied his platoons to attack the airbase. However, most of the clone troopers did not believe that Krell's plan would work, but Dogma insisted that it would work out. The plan did succeed at the end, as Fives and [[Hardcase]] hijacked two Umbaran starfighters from the airbase, and used them to destroy several [[Umbaran mobile heavy cannon]]s harassing the troopers.<ref name="General" /> General Krell then ordered the airbase placed under their complete control.<ref name="PoD">{{TCW|Plan of Dissent}}</ref>

Later that night, Fives, [[CT-5597|Jesse]], and Hardcase sneaked out and boarded several Umbaran starfighters to destroy a [[DH-Omni Support Vessel]] resupplying the Umbaran defenses. Dogma went with fellow trooper [[CT-5385|Tup]] to inform General Krell. However they were stopped by Rex. When Fives and Jesse returned, with Hardcase having sacrificed himself to destroy the supply ship, Krell told them that although their actions were heroic, they would be found guilty and executed, because they had disobeyed his direct order.<ref name="PoD" />

[[File:DogmaArrogant-CoK.png|left|thumb|220x220px|Dogma was all too eager to execute his brothers.]]
During the execution of Fives and Jesse, Dogma was in charge of the execution squad, which included Tup and [[CT-6116|Kix]]. However, Fives appealed to his brothers, resulting in the squad purposely missing their target and dropping their blaster rifles. Shocked, Dogma tried to restore order, but Rex told him that the squad did not share his point of view. After that, Krell received a transmission that Umbarans had stolen clone trooper equipment. As a result, Krell temporarily put aside the execution of Fives and Jesse. Dogma accompanied the 501st to engage the enemy, and the resulting firefight resulted in a [[Waxer's platoon|platoon]] of the [[212th Attack Battalion]] and the 501st Legion firing on one another. After successfully breaking the battle, Rex questioned the platoon leader, [[Waxer]], about who had given the orders to attack the 501st Legion. Just before he died, Waxer revealed it was Krell who had given the order. Rex was able to convince the clones to arrest General Krell. However, Dogma remained loyal to Krell, and refused to help them prevent Krell from escaping. Dogma tried to prevent Rex from pursuing the fleeing Krell, but after some convincing, Dogma lowered his blaster, and was taken to the brig.<ref name="Carnage of Krell">{{TCW|Carnage of Krell}}</ref>

[[File:Rexecutioner-CoK.png|thumb|right|220x220px|Dogma watches as Krell taunts Rex.]]
After the clones had subdued Krell, he was detained in the brig and placed in a holding cell right next to Dogma's cell. As Krell revealed his betrayal to Rex, Dogma was shocked by the fact that his loyalty was just a key pawn in Krell's plan to undermine the Republic's efforts. Later, Fives released Dogma, and Rex decided to execute Krell after [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] alerted him that the Umbarans would soon attack the captured airbase. When Rex pointed his pistol at Krell, the fallen Jedi taunted him, turning his steady hand into an unsteady trigger. Dogma then stole one of Fives' pistols and fatally shot Krell in the back, ending the fallen Jedi's life. Dogma stated that he had to shoot Krell, because "he betrayed us." After the battle ended, Dogma was taken into custody for killing a Jedi, but as he was led away, Rex gave him a reassuring nod to let him know that he did the right thing.<ref name="Carnage of Krell" />

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|I...I had to...he betrayed us.|Dogma after killing Pong Krell|Carnage of Krell}}
Dogma, a [[clone trooper]] of the [[501st Legion]], was a described as a loyal soldier, in which he never questioned or disobeyed the order from a commanding officer. During the [[Battle of Umbara]], he was the most loyal of the clone troopers to [[Pong Krell]], and agreed with all his tactics and strategies. He refused to listen to the other clones who said that different strategies other than full-forward assault would accomplish the same mission with much less loss of life.<ref name="Darkness on Umbara" /><ref name="General" /> Like his fellow clones, Dogma was horrorstruck and shocked during the realization that the 501st Legion and the [[212th Attack Battalion]] had engaged each other, which was a deception by General Krell. Dogma was called a "fool" by Krell because of his blind loyalty. When his fellow clones tried to arrest Krell, who had turned to the dark side, Dogma attempted to stop them, calling them traitors. When Pong Krell revealed his betrayal, Dogma was shocked and angered, since he was Krell's most loyal soldier. Eventually, Krell was shot to death by his most loyal soldier.<ref name="Carnage of Krell" />

Dogma shaved his head and sported a tattoo across his face. His helmet, uniquely, had a triangular design that reflected his tattoo.<ref name="Darkness on Umbara" />

==Equipment==
Dogma wore [[phase II clone trooper armor]] with blue markings and used a [[DC-15A blaster|DC-15A]] [[blaster]]. As a soldier of the 501st Legion, Dogma's armor sported blue markings and a red triangle on his helmet.<ref name="Darkness on Umbara" />
