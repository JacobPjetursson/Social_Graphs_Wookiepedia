'''Lott Dod''' was a [[Neimoidian]] [[Sexes|male]] [[Politics|politician]] who served as the [[senator]] of the [[Trade Federation]] during the [[Invasion of Naboo]] and the [[Clone Wars]].

==Biography==
Lott Dod represented the [[Trade Federation]] in the [[Galactic Senate]] during the twilight [[Standard year|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic]]. During the Federation's [[Invasion of Naboo|occupation]] of [[Naboo]], Dod used his position to object to Naboo's claims about the Federation, and attempted to force a delay in any action on the Senate's part.<ref name="Episode I" />

===Clone Wars===
Over [[Standard decade|ten years]] later, during the [[Clone Wars]], the Federation and its leader, [[Viceroy of the Trade Federation|Viceroy]] [[Nute Gunray]], were allied with the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]].<ref name="Ep.II">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]</ref> Dod again used his position in the Senate in an attempt to claim that the Federation as a whole was not a member of the Separatist Alliance,<ref name="SoS">{{TCW|Sphere of Influence}}</ref> and that Gunray was a fanatic who did not represent the Federation.<ref name="Supply Line">{{TCW|Supply Lines}}</ref> Dod also conspired with Senator [[Rush Clovis]] and Separatist Council member [[Poggle the Lesser]] to build a [[Geonosis primary droid foundry|droid factory]] on Poggle's home world of [[Geonosis]].<ref name="SS">{{TCW|Senate Spy}}</ref>

Sometime later during the conflict, Dod was [[Death|killed]].<ref name="Poe Dameron 20" />

==Behind the scenes==
Lott Dod first appeared in the [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (novelization)|novelization]] of the [[1999]] film [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']] by [[Terry Brooks]],<ref name="novelization">[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (novelization)|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'' novelization]]</ref> and then in the film itself.<ref name="Episode I" /> He was played by [[Silas Carson]] and voiced by [[Toby Longworth]] in the film.<ref name="Episode I" /> Dod later appeared in the television series ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'', where he was voiced by [[Gideon Emery]].

Lott Dod was named after then-[[Wikipedia:Republican Party (United States)|GOP]] [[Wikipedia:Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate leader]] in [[1997]] [[Wikipedia:Trent Lott|Trent Lott]], in an attempt to directly connect the Trade Federation's characterization and motives with that of the [[Wikipedia:Republican Revolution|Republican Revolution]] that occurred in [[1994]].<ref name="Republican Revolution's ties to Trade Federation and TPM's plot">''[[How Star Wars Conquered the Universe: The Past, Present Future of a Multibillion Dollar Franchise]]''</ref> Originally, for his appearance, Dod and the Neimoidians were designed as organic versions of the Federation's B1 battle droids to suggest that the Neimoidians had modeled the battle droids after their own image. For this to work, the Neimoidians would have had to been produced by [[Wikipedia:Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated imagery]]. During production, [[Lucasfilm Ltd.]]'s Art Department opted to use animatronic masks to bring the Neimoidians to life. Consequently, the Neimoidians' appearances changed dramatically and Dod's senatorial miter, which first appeared in rough sketches of the Neimoidian, later took the shape of fellow Separatist [[Rune Haako]].<ref name="db">{{DB|character|lottdod|Lott Dod}}</ref>

In the [[2002]] film [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']], a Neimoidian wearing clothing similar to that of Dod appears alongside Nute Gunray on Geonosis, spawning a debate as to who the Neimoidian was. The end credits for the film identify the Neimoidian as Lott Dod (as portrayed by [[Alan Ruscoe]]), but the Neimoidian does not resemble Dod.<ref name="AotC">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]</ref>
