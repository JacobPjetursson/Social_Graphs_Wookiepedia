'''Gregar Typho''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] and a [[captain]] of the [[Royal Naboo Security Forces]] during the [[Separatist Crisis]] and the [[Clone Wars]]. He served as [[Senator]] [[Padmé Amidala]]'s head of security, ensuring her safety at all costs. Typho followed in the footsteps of his uncle, [[Quarsh Panaka]], who was a Naboo Royal Security Forces captain during the [[Invasion of Naboo]].

==Biography==
===Separatist Crisis===
During the [[Separatist Crisis]], [[Captain]] Gregar Typho accompanied [[Senator]] [[Padmé Amidala]] on a diplomatic mission to the [[The galaxy|galactic]] [[capital]] [[Coruscant]] to vote against the upcoming [[Military Creation Act]]. A growing [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist movement]] led by the charismatic former [[Jedi]] [[Count]] [[Dooku]] was challenging the ailing [[Galactic Republic]]. In response, [[Loyalist Committee|loyalist]] elements led by [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]] had introduced legislation to create a [[Grand Army of the Republic]].<ref name="Episode II" />

Due to Amidala's high profile, the Senator and Captain Typho had traveled to Coruscant disguised as [[starfighter]] [[pilot]]s. One of Amidala's [[Naboo Royal Handmaidens|handmaidens]], [[Cordé]], had posed as Amidala and traveled on her [[J-type diplomatic barge|diplomatic barge]]. This ruse enabled Amidala to escape an [[Plot to assassinate Padmé Amidala|assassination attempt]] which claimed the life of her decoy and several members of her entourage. While Amidala was grieving over the fallen Cordé, Typho comforted her by assuring Amidala that the handmaiden had died in the line of duty.<ref name="Episode II" />

Later, Typho went to Amidala's apartment on Coruscant to establish security there. The Senator's security detail was further augmented by two [[Jedi]]: the [[Jedi Knight]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and his [[Padawan]] [[Anakin Skywalker]], who had a crush on Amidala. Following a second assassination attempt against Amidala by the [[Clawdite]] assassin [[Zam Wesell]] involving two poisonous [[Indoumodo kouhun|kouhuns]], Amidala returned to Naboo accompanied by Skywalker. Following these events, Typho remained on Coruscant to protect the [[Gungan]] Representative [[Jar Jar Binks]], who took Amidala's place on the Senate. Binks sponsored the creation of the Grand Army, which foreshadowed the outbreak of the [[Clone Wars]].<ref name="Episode II" />

===Blue Shadow Virus crisis===
Captain Typho and his men shot down and captured three [[B1 battle droid]]s and a [[T-series tactical droid]]. In response, the reigning [[Queen]] [[Neeyutnee]] summoned Senator Amidala and Representative Jar Jar Binks back to Naboo to request for military assistance from the Galactic Republic. Captain Typho was present when Amidala, Binks, and C-3PO interrogated the captured tactical droid. Tricking the droid into thinking that it was on a Separatist warship, C-3PO managed to glean that there was a secret Separatist research installation on Naboo, producing a virus.<ref name="Blue Shadow Virus">{{TCW|Blue Shadow Virus (episode)|Blue Shadow Virus}}</ref>

When the tactical droid realized that it was not on a Separatist warship, Typho raised a blaster at the droid and demanded that it cooperate. Before he could proceed, Binks accidentally destroyed the droid by knocking over some shelves while trying to catch a [[slug-beetle]]. Despite this setback, Amidala and Binks deduced that the droid came from Naboo's [[Eastern swamps]] due to the presence of mud on its chassis and the slug-beetle, which Binks recognized as originating from those swamps. While Amidala and company traveled to the Eastern Swamps to investigate, Captain Typho and Threepio remained behind to examine the other battle droids.<ref name="Blue Shadow Virus" />

While examining a B1 battle droid's head, Typho and C-3PO discovered a [[hologram]] of a Separatist [[scientist]] named [[Doctor]] [[Nuvo Vindi]] and quickly relayed this information to Amidala. Meanwhile, Amidala and her companions discovered [[Trade Federation laboratory|Dr Vindi's laboratory]] in the Eastern Swamps. Vindi was developing a deadly bioweapon called the [[Blue Shadow Virus]] for use by the Separatists.<ref name="Blue Shadow Virus" />

Following a dangerous struggle, Amidala and her companions with the help of the Jedi Kenobi, Skywalker, his Padawan [[Ahsoka Tano]] and several [[Clone trooper]]s managed to apprehend Vindi and stop him from releasing an airborne strain of the virus. Despite being exposed to the Blue Shadow Virus, Amidala and Binks survived due to Skywalker and Kenobi's efforts to obtain an antidote, the [[Reeksa|root of a reeksa plant]] from the planet [[Iego]].<ref name="Mystery of a Thousand Moons">{{TCW|Mystery of a Thousand Moons}}</ref>

===Final days of the war===
In [[19 BBY|the last year]] of the Clone Wars, the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]] was [[Jedi Purge|attacked]] and many Jedi were [[Order 66|wiped out]]. Almost immediately after, Amidala was visited by Kenobi, who told her impacting news about her husband. After Kenobi departed, Amidala decided to travel to the planet [[Mustafar]] despite Typho's recommendations of otherwise. This turned out to be the last time Typho saw Amidala alive, as she died after [[Reproduction|giving birth]] to [[Luke Skywalker|her]] [[Leia Organa|children]] two days later on [[Polis Massa]].<ref name="Episode III">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref>

Gregar Typho was portrayed by [[Jay Laga'aia]] in both the [[2002]] film [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']] and the [[2005]] film [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']].<ref name="Episode II" /><ref name="Episode III" /> He was voiced by [[James Mathis III]] in ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' TV series, which aired from [[2008]] to [[2013]].
