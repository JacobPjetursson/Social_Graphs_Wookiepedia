[[File:MinaBonteriSpeaks-HOBS.png|thumb|left|280px|Mina Bonteri addresses the Separatist Senate.]]
By the [[time]] the [[Cloning|Clone]] Wars broke out, Bonteri had joined [[Count]] [[Dooku]]'s [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] as a member of the [[Separatist Senate]]. She and her son relocated to the Confederacy's [[Capital]], [[Raxus]] where they had a [[Mina Bonteri's house|home]] in [[Raxulon]]. By then, Bonteri's [[Marriage|husband]] had been [[Death|killed]] by [[clone trooper]]s during a [[Battle of Aargonar (Clone Wars)|battle]] on [[Aargonar]].<ref name="HOBS" />

Bonteri was later contacted by Amidala who wished to discuss a [[Confederate–Republic peace initiative|peace initiative]] between the [[Galactic Republic]] and Confederacy. During a session of the Confederate Senate, Bonteri called for a vote to open the peace talks with Republic. However, Bonteri's efforts were thwarted by [[General]] [[Grievous]]'s [[Bombing of Coruscant's central power distribution grid|terrorist attack]] on [[Coruscant]] on the orders of Dooku.<ref name="HOBS" />
