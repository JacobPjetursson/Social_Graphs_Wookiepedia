{{Quote|To those who act as agents of chaos, I say this: I stand resolute and unyielding. And if you strike my voice down, know that a chorus of thousands shall rise up in its place, for you have no dominion over the righteous. We are the defenders of truth.|Padmé Amidala|Assassin (episode)}}
'''Padmé Amidala''', also known as '''Padmé Amidala Naberrie''', was a [[human]] [[Sexes|female]] [[senator]] who represented the [[Naboo (people)|people]] of [[Naboo]] during the [[Fall of the Republic|final years]] of the [[Galactic Republic]]. Prior to her career in the [[Galactic Senate]], Amidala was the [[Politics|elected]] [[Monarch of Naboo|ruler]] of the [[Royal House of Naboo]]. A political idealist, she advocated for the preservation of [[democracy]] as well as a peaceful resolution to the [[Clone Wars]]. However, her secret [[marriage]] to the [[Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker]] would have a lasting effect on the future of [[the galaxy]] for [[Standard decade|decades]] to come.

[[Reproduction|Born]] in [[46 BBY]] during the [[Republic Era|Age of the Republic]], '''Padmé Naberrie''' was raised by her [[parent]]s, [[Ruwee Naberrie]] and his wife [[Jobal Naberrie|Jobal]], on the peaceful [[Mid Rim]] [[Planet|world]] of Naboo. Despite the humble background of the [[Naberrie family]], Padmé was identified early for her potential in public service. Devoting her life to civic duty, she was elected [[queen]] and, therefore, adopted the regal name "Amidala" in [[32 BBY]]. Due to the machinations of her [[advisor]], Senator [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]], Amidala's reign was put to the test by the [[Trade Federation]]'s [[blockade]] and subsequent [[Invasion of Naboo|invasion]] of Naboo. Unable to fight the Federation's [[army]] of [[battle droid]]s without assistance, the queen beseeched the [[Galaxy|Galactic]] Senate on [[Coruscant]] for help, only to see her efforts hampered by [[Bureaucrat|bureaucracy]] and procedure. Although she ultimately [[Battle of Naboo|liberated]] her [[homeworld]] with the help of the [[Jedi Order]] and the [[Gungan Grand Army]], her decision to cast a [[Vote of No Confidence]] against [[Finis Valorum]] enabled Palpatine to become the [[Supreme Chancellor]].

Following her reign, Amidala joined the Senate and struggled to resolve the [[Separatist Crisis]] through diplomacy, becoming a leading voice in the [[Loyalist Committee]] by [[22 BBY]]. After surviving an [[Plot to assassinate Padmé Amidala|assassination attempt]], she was removed from the [[capital]] and sent back to Naboo under the protection of [[Padawan]] Anakin Skywalker. Though the [[Jedi Code]] forbade personal relationships, deeming attachment and possession unbecoming of a [[Jedi]], the two gradually became closer as their feelings for each other grew. In the aftermath of the [[Battle of Geonosis]], Amidala secretly married her Jedi [[Bodyguard|protector]] despite her own reservations about their relationship and the consequences they would face if the truth ever came to light. Their subsequent interactions were limited throughout the [[Cloning|Clone]] Wars, with Amidala continuing to advocate peaceful solutions in the Senate while Skywalker served on the frontlines as a [[Jedi General]] in the [[Grand Army of the Republic]]. In the waning [[Standard month|months]] of the pan-galactic conflict, Amidala revealed to her husband that she was pregnant. As a result of Skywalker's fear of loss, he was seduced by the [[dark side of the Force]], believing that by becoming a [[Sith Lord]] he would gain the [[Force power|power]] to prevent his wife from [[Death|dying]] in childbirth. Amidala, who learned of her husband's transformation into a [[Sith]], ultimately died of a broken [[heart]] after giving birth to the [[twin]]s [[Luke Skywalker]] and [[Leia Organa|Leia Amidala Skywalker]]. With her dying breath, she claimed that there was still [[Light side of the Force|good]] in the former Anakin Skywalker, who embraced the persona of [[Darth]] Vader throughout the [[Imperial Era|reign]] of the [[Galactic Empire]].

Amidala's children played a major role in the [[Galactic Civil War|fragmentation]] of the Empire and the redemption of her husband. Like her mother, Leia entered public service and became a flag-bearer for the democratic ideals of liberty and justice as a leader in the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] and its successor, the [[New Republic]], before becoming the founding [[general]] of the [[Resistance]] against the [[First Order]]—a successor state to the Galactic Empire. Luke, on the other hand, was trained in the ways of the Jedi like his father before him and was a celebrated war hero of the Rebel Alliance. Through Luke's efforts to redeem his father back to the light, Amidala's last words proved true when Anakin killed the Emperor during the [[Battle of Endor]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
A [[human]] [[Sexes|female]] of the [[Naberrie family]], the woman best remembered as Amidala was [[Reproduction|born]] Padmé Naberrie on the bountiful [[planet]] of [[Naboo]] in [[46 BBY]].<ref name="BioGal1" /> She was the younger daughter of [[Ruwee Naberrie|Ruwee]] and [[Jobal Naberrie]]<ref name="Star Wars Card Trader">[[Star Wars: Card Trader|''Star Wars'': Card Trader]]</ref> and the sister of [[Sola Naberrie]]. Her father, Ruwee Naberrie, was a friend of [[Senator]] [[Onaconda Farr]], who represented the [[Star system|solar system]] of [[Rodia]] in the [[Galactic Senate|Senate]] of the [[Galactic Republic]]. Amidala was very fond of the [[Rodian]], whom she referred to as "Uncle Ono."<ref name="Bombad Jedi">{{TCW|Bombad Jedi}}</ref>

===Rise to queenship===
{{Quote|I wasn't the youngest Queen ever elected. But now that I think back on it, I'm not sure I was old enough. I'm not sure I was ready.|Padmé Amidala|Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones}}
Although her [[parent]]s were of modest origins, Naberrie was identified as a gifted and brilliant young girl at an early age. As a [[Youngling|child]], she devoted herself to public service,<ref name="BioGal1" /> joining the [[Apprentice Legislature|Apprentice Legislators]] at the tender age of eight, and she eventually became a junior senatorial adviser.<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" /> At age twelve, Naberrie participated in the [[Legislative Youth Program]], in which she met a slightly older boy named [[Palo Jemabie]]. The two fell in love, but their relationship did not last, as they parted ways when Palo left [[politics]] and chose to become an [[artist]].<ref name="Episode II" /> At the same age, she started a two-[[Standard year|year]] mandate as supervisor of [[Theed]], the [[capital]] city of Naboo.<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" />

Two years later, Padmé Naberrie [[Coronation of Queen Amidala|was]] [[Democracy|elected]] [[Monarch of Naboo|Queen of Naboo]], and she adopted Amidala as her name of office.<ref name="BioGal1" /> When in danger, Amidala would disguise herself as one of her staff of five loyal handmaidens and would introduce herself as "Padmé" while her decoy [[Sabé]] assumed the persona of Queen Amidala.<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" /> Although she was not the youngest sovereign ever elected, she would later question her own maturity at the [[time]] of her election.<ref name="Episode II" />

===The Invasion of Naboo===
{{Quote|I was not elected to watch my people suffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee!|Queen Amidala, to the Galactic Senate|audio=IWasNotElected-TPM.ogg|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace}}
Shortly after her election, the young [[queen]] was faced with a major crisis when the [[Trade Federation]] decided to lay siege to her [[Homeworld|home planet]]. The Federation's devious leader, [[Viceroy of the Trade Federation|Viceroy]] [[Nute Gunray]], intended to force her to sign a treaty that would legitimize the invasion in the [[eye]]s of the Galactic Republic. However, Amidala refused to submit to the Federation. The [[Viceroy]] then sent her to [[Camp Four]]. However, Amidala was rescued in the eleventh hour by two [[Jedi]], [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and his [[Padawan|apprentice]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]. The two had been charged with negotiating a truce with the Trade Federation, but Gunray had tried to [[Death|kill]] them as soon as they had arrived. The Jedi freed Amidala and her entourage from the clutches of the Federation's [[battle droid]]s, and the group fled the [[blockade]]d Naboo aboard the queen's [[Naboo Royal Starship|royal starship]].<ref name="Episode I" />

[[File:Queenamidala.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Queen Amidala of Naboo]]
However, the royal [[starship]] was damaged in combat while trying to break through the blockade of [[battleship]]s the Federation had deployed around the Naboo star system. The [[hyperdrive]] generator needed to be repaired, which prompted the crew to make an emergency landing on [[Tatooine]]. The queen, who was curious about the [[desert]] world, disguised as one of her [[Naboo Royal Handmaidens|handmaidens]]&mdash;using her birth name of Padmé Naberrie&mdash;so she could accompany the Jedi on the planet's surface. With her companions, Amidala ventured into the [[spaceport]] of [[Mos Espa]], which Qui-Gon Jinn described as a haven for "those who do not wish to be found." While trying to negotiate for spare parts with the [[junk dealer]] [[Watto]], the party met [[Anakin Skywalker]], a nine-year-old human [[Slavery|slave]]. The boy was immediately fascinated by Amidala's aura of beauty, asking her whether she was an [[angel]] from the [[moon]]s of [[Iego]]. In turn, the queen thought the boy was a bit odd, yet charming.<ref name="Episode I" />

Since the Jedi and the queen could not raise the [[Currency|money]] needed to purchase the repair parts for the royal ship, Skywalker offered to compete in the incoming [[Boonta Eve]] [[Boonta Eve Classic|Classic]] [[Podracing|Podrace]] so he could earn the required funds for them. Master Jinn promptly accepted the offer, but Amidala criticized his actions; although she did like Skywalker, she thought it was unwise to place the fate of Naboo in the [[Limb|hands]] of a nine-year-old boy. However, Skywalker managed to win the race, beating the reigning champion [[Sebulba]] against all odds, and Amidala joined the scenes of jubilation that followed the boy's victory in the [[Mos Espa Grand Arena|Grand Arena]] of Mos Espa. Thanks to a bargain Qui-Gon Jinn had made with Watto, Skywalker was now freed from slavery and allowed to accompany the Jedi in their travel. On the way to the galactic capital of [[Coruscant]], Amidala, still in the guise of the handmaiden Padmé, helped Skywalker cope with the loss of his mother [[Shmi Skywalker Lars|Shmi]], whom Watto had refused to let go.<ref name="Episode I" />

===The fight for Theed===
{{Quote|Now, Viceroy, we will discuss a new treaty!|Queen Amidala after capturing Nute Gunray|audio=ANewTreaty-TPM.ogg|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace}}
Once the group arrived on Coruscant, Amidala resumed her role as queen. In preparation for her public appearance before the Republic Senate, she met with [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]], who represented the Naboo system in that governing body. While she wished to plead for the Senate to rescue her homeworld, Palpatine informed her that the assembly was too corrupt to care about their situation. The senator then encouraged Amidala to move for a [[Vote of No Confidence]] in the leadership of [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Finis Valorum]], ruler of the Republic. Valorum was a well-meaning politician, and the queen initially refused to move against him. However, upon witnessing the problems of politics during the Senate session in which she pleaded, Amidala ended up following Palpatine's advice, asking for Valorum's ousting from office. An election was decided, and Palpatine himself emerged as a likely candidate to succeed the disgraced Valorum. Although the senator asked to stay on Coruscant until the end of the elective process, Amidala decided to return to Naboo, intent on retaking her world without the Senate's help.<ref name="Episode I" />

[[File:Panaka Amidala.png|thumb|right|300px|Amidala and the Naboo Security Forces fight for control of the palace.]]
En route, the queen revealed to a concerned Master Jinn that she planned to unite with the [[Gungan]]s, the [[Sentience|sentient]] [[amphibian]]s native to Naboo. However, Jinn and his apprentice Kenobi had met the Gungans at the beginning of their adventure, and the natives had expressed their lack of interest for the fate of the Naboo humans. Having once again assumed the identity of a handmaiden, the queen journeyed through the [[swamp]]s of Naboo with her party. They managed to locate the sacred place where the Gungans had taken refuge after evacuating their [[city]] of [[Otoh Gunga]]. Initially, the decoy queen Sabé tried to negotiate herself with [[Boss]] [[Rugor Nass|Nass]], leader of the Gungans, but to little avail. As a sign of trust, the real Amidala decided to reveal her identity, which surprised not only the Gungans, but also all of her companions. The queen then kneeled in front of Boss Nass, asking for help in battling the Federation troops. Impressed by the queen's respectful attitude, Nass heartily agreed.<ref name="Episode I" />

Though the queen's plan ended up working perfectly, it did not come about without loss. On the [[Great Grass Plains|grassy plains]] of Naboo, there were Gungan casualties until Anakin Skywalker destroyed the Federation's [[Lucrehulk-class Battleship|Droid Control Ship]]. Additionally, Master Qui-Gon Jinn was killed during his duel with the [[Sith Lord]] [[Maul|Darth Maul]]. Now that Naboo was freed, Amidala greeted Palpatine, who came to announce to her that he had been elected Supreme Chancellor, since many had voted for him in an outpouring of sympathy. In the immediate aftermath of the invasion, Amidala attended Qui-Gon Jinn's [[Funeral of Qui-Gon Jinn|ritual cremation]] in a funeral temple of Theed to pay her respects. Finally, a huge parade was held in the Naboo capital to celebrate the official unification of the humans and Gungans. During the ceremony, which was attended by Chancellor Palpatine, the members of the [[Jedi High Council|Jedi Council]], Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Anakin Skywalker, Amidala handed over a symbolic orb to an overjoyed Boss Nass as a symbol of peace between the long-warring peoples. As the square erupted with applause, Amidala shared an unseen smile with Anakin.<ref name="Episode I" />

===Separatist Crisis===
{{Quote|Wake up, Senators&hellip; you must wake up! If we offer the Separatists violence, they can only show us violence in return! Many will lose their lives. All will lose their freedom.|Padmé Amidala, before the Galactic Senate, after the first of many attempts on her life|Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones}}
At the conclusion of her two terms as queen, Amidala stepped aside for her elected successor, [[Jamillia|Queen Jamillia]]. In the time of her rule, the Naboo had grown so fond of Amidala that there was widespread talk that the constitution should be amended to allow her another term. Amidala declined this, however, since popular rule was not democratic and she was relieved to have done her part. Not long after her coronation, Queen Jamillia asked Amidala to serve as Naboo's representative in the Galactic Senate, a request that Amidala ultimately accepted.<ref name="Episode II" /> Amidala entered the Senate in the same year as Senator [[Rush Clovis]] of [[Scipio]]. The pair served on several Senate committees together and became close; Amidala ultimately ended the relationship however, something which Clovis did not take very well.<ref name="Senate Spy">{{TCW|Senate Spy}}</ref> Ten years after the Invasion of Naboo, former Jedi [[Count]] [[Dooku]] became the public face of a [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] that had withdrawn from the Republic in opposition to the corruption they believed had enveloped the Senate. In response to the threat posed by this Separatist Alliance, the Republic Senate debated the proposed [[Military Creation Act]] that would allow Supreme Chancellor Palpatine to formally commission a [[Grand Army of the Republic]]. During this time, Amidala became a member of the Chancellor's [[Loyalist Committee]] and was regarded as the leader of the opposition to the Military Creation Act.<ref name="Episode II" />

[[File:Loyalist Committee-AOC.png|thumb|left|250px|Amidala and the Loyalist Committee meet with Chancellor Palpatine.]]
On the eve of the vote in the Senate over the Military Creation Act, Amidala arrived on Coruscant. Upon landing, her [[J-type diplomatic barge|cruiser]] was hit in an [[Plot to assassinate Padmé Amidala|assassination attempt]] by [[bounty hunter]] [[Zam Wesell]], who had been hired to kill Amidala by [[Jango Fett]], himself under the employee of Count Dooku. The explosion killed several of her [[Royal Naboo Security Forces|guards]] as well as Amidala's double, [[Cordé]]. At the request of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, the Jedi Council assigned [[Jedi Knight]]s Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker to protect Amidala and investigate the incident, though Amidala objected to the added security. That evening, Amidala met with Kenobi and Skywalker in her [[Padmé's Apartment|penthouse apartment]]. With several years having passed, Skywalker was nervous to meet Amidala and while she hid her feelings, Kenobi noted that the senator was pleased to see Skywalker as well. That night, Zam Wesell tried again to kill Amidala by releasing two deadly [[Indoumodo kouhun|kouhuns]] into her apartment using a [[ASN-121|droid]]. Kenobi and Skywalker sensed the attack and rushed into the bedroom. Skywalker managed to kill the Kouhuns as Kenobi jumped through the bedroom window and grabbed on to the droid as security officers rushed into the apartment. Kenobi and Skywalker, after a chase through the Coruscant skylanes, were able to capture Zam Wesell. Before she could reveal the plot behind the assassination attempts on Amidala, Wesell was killed by Jango Fett using a [[Kamino saberdart|Kamino dart]].<ref name="Episode II" />

In the aftermath of continued attacks, Amidala was convinced to leave Coruscant and to return to Naboo. While Skywalker went with her to continue protecting her, Kenobi continued the investigation into the assassination attempts. Upon arriving on Naboo, Amidala and Skywalker grew closer in their relationship and Skywalker told her of his love for her. However, since Skywalker was committed to the [[Jedi Order]] and Amidala to the Senate, they both agreed to forgo pursing a more romantic relationship. While on Naboo, Skywalker started experiencing [[Force vision]]s of his mother in danger. Convinced he had to save her, he determined to travel to Tatooine. Amidala traveled with him and upon their arrival at the [[Lars moisture farm]], Skywalker discovered that his mother had been taken by [[Tusken Raider]]s. He was able to track them down, but was too late and his mother died in his arms. Angered, he slaughtered the entire [[Tusken Raider camp|village]] including the women and children. He returned to the homestead to bury his mother. Later, Skywalker confessed to Amidala his despair and anger and what he had done and she attempted to comfort him.<ref name="Episode II" />

===War and marriage===
{{Quote|You call this a diplomatic solution?''"<br />"''No, I call it aggressive negotiations.|Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala|audio=AggressiveNegotiations-AOTC.ogg|Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones}}
Meanwhile, Kenobi had traced Jango Fett to the planet [[Geonosis]] and discovered that Count Dooku was behind the assassination attempts. He also learned that the Separatists had built a droid army to attack the Republic and that the Republic had at its disposal an army of [[clone trooper]]s supposedly commissioned by the long deceased [[Jedi Master]] [[Sifo-Dyas]]. Requesting that Skywalker relay his message to Coruscant, Kenobi informed the Jedi and the Senate what he had discovered, just before he was [[Prisoner|captured]]. The Jedi decided to send an [[Jedi assault team|assault team]], while Skywalker was ordered to stay with Amidala. Torn over the desire to rescue his master but yet also protect the senator, Amidala came to the decision to help Skywalker by traveling to Geonosis, forcing Skywalker to accompany her. However, their rescue was a failure and they were captured. Before they were led to the [[Petranaki arena|arena]] to be executed, Amidala confessed her love for Skywalker, reasoning that there was no point in denying it before they died.<ref name="Episode II" />

[[File:Husband and wife.png|thumb|right|250px|Amidala and Skywalker are married.]]
The execution of Amidala, Skywalker, and Kenobi was to be carried out by several creatures brought into the arena, a [[reek]], an [[acklay]], and a [[nexu]]. As they were released and attacked, Jedi Master [[Mace Windu]] arrived and the Jedi revealed themselves. A [[Battle of Geonosis|full out battle]] erupted, and though Amidala had been wounded by one of the creatures, she also grabbed a [[blaster]] and fought side-by-side with the Jedi. Of the original two hundred Jedi who had arrived, only a few were left and the situation seemed lost. At that point, Master [[Yoda]] arrived with the newly christened Grand Army of the Republic and the Battle of Geonosis began in earnest. Skywalker, Kenobi, and Amidala pursued Count Dooku in a [[Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry|Republic gunship]], but Amidala and the trooper were knocked from the troop bay by a [[cannon]] blast. They were able to call backup, but arrived too late to stop Dooku who had fought against Skywalker and Kenobi before being defeated by Yoda. After the battle, Skywalker and Amidala returned to Naboo where they were secretly [[Wedding of Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala|married]].<ref name="Episode II" />

===The Clone Wars===
====Negotiations with the Hutts====
[[File:Padme talks to Jabba.png|thumb|left|250px|Amidala pleads with Jabba.]]
Sometime after the Battle of Geonosis, Amidala spoke with the Chancellor about Naboo's new security measures due to several new battles in the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]]. Amidala was then informed that [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the [[Hutt]] believed Skywalker had kidnapped his son, [[Rotta]], and that he was refusing to negotiate with the Republic. Amidala then offered to negotiate with Jabba through his uncle, [[Ziro Desilijic Tiure|Ziro]], who lived on Coruscant at his [[Ziro's Palace|palace]]. Amidala went there to speak to him, but he refused to listen to her. Amidala sneaked back into his palace where she overheard Ziro speaking with Count Dooku, promising that Rotta, Skywalker, and his apprentice would be eliminated, that the Jedi would bring Jabba to justice and Ziro would become head of the [[Hutt Clan]]. Amidala was discovered and captured by Ziro's droids and was promised to Dooku as his prisoner. Amidala was taken to the palace dungeon where she was able to trick the droids into activating her communicator, alerting her assistant C-3PO to her predicament before the [[IG-86 sentinel droid|droids]] destroyed it. Ziro, seeing that Amidala was too dangerous to be kept alive, decided to execute her knowing his powerful friends in the Senate would protect him. Amidala was then rescued by C-3PO, who brought in Coruscant Guard Commander Fox and his troopers. Amidala then subdued one of her guards, took its weapon and held Ziro at gunpoint. She contacted Jabba, informed him of his uncle's treachery, and ensured a treaty between the Republic and the Hutts.<ref name="TCW film">[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' film]]</ref>

====Trap on the ''Malevolence''====
[[File:Padme's yacht captured.png|thumb|right|270px|Amidala's ship is caught by the ''Malevolence''{{'}}s tractor beam.]]
Amidala was then sent on a mission by Palpatine to negotiate with a representative of the [[InterGalactic Banking Clan|Banking Clan]] about withdrawing from the war. She, along with [[C-3PO]], traveled to the rendezvous. However, Amidala learned that it was all a trap when she came out in the middle of a battle between the Republic fleet and the Confederacy's heavy cruiser, the ''[[Malevolence]]''. She tried to move away from the heavy cruiser, but was pulled in by the ''Malevolence''{{'}}s [[tractor beam]]. Though she urged the Republic fleet to continue their attack, refusing to allow herself to become a bargaining chip, her husband ordered them to stop. As her [[H-type Nubian yacht|ship]] set down in the hangar bay, Amidala rigged it to blow in the hopes that it might take Grievous with it. The ship did indeed explode with the general aboard, taking several battle droids with it but he survived. She and C-3PO then managed to make their escape from General Grievous into the bowels of the ''Malevolence''. She was able to contact Skywalker and Kenobi, who had boarded the ship to rescue her.<ref name="Destroy Malevolence">{{TCW|Destroy Malevolence|Destroy ''Malevolence''}}</ref>

The two groups met at a point halfway between them, though Skywalker and Amidala soon became separated from Kenobi, Threepio and Artoo. While Kenobi was forced to delegate the rescue of 3PO to R2, to ensure that the hyperdrive stayed offline, Skywalker and Amidala made their way to the bridge to make adjustments to the navicomputer that would cause the ''Malevolence'' to pilot itself into a moon. Both missions proved a success, and the group managed to escape the ''Malevolence''.<ref name="Destroy Malevolence" />

While Grievous personally took his starfighter, the ''[[Soulless One]]'', and several other fighters that attacked the group as they attempted to dock with the Republic fleet, the ''Malevolence'' began to move towards a near moon, before colliding with it, destroying the heavy cruiser instantly. With the loss of the ''Malevolence'', Grievous fled the battle, and Amidala and her companions reached safety.<ref name="Destroy Malevolence" />

====Crisis on Rodia====
[[File:Mission to Rodia.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Amidala on Rodia]]
Amidala then traveled to Rodia with C-3PO and Representative Jar Jar Binks in an effort to persuade her old friend, Onaconda Farr to remain loyal to the Republic. Unfortunately, when she arrived, Amidala learned that Farr had already pledged his system to the Separatists as Viceroy Nute Gunray could provide them with supplies and protection, unlike the Republic. Amidala was imprisoned to await Gunray's arrival, while Threepio was scheduled to be scrapped and Binks managed to evade arrest.<ref name="Bombad Jedi" />

Wearing a discarded Jedi [[robe]] he found within Amidala's cruiser, Binks mistakenly caused his pursuers to believe he was a Jedi. After hearing word of a Jedi being near by, Amidala managed to outsmart the battle droids and escape her cell. Amidala then proceeded to rescue Threepio; and was dismayed to learn that the Jedi she had heard about was merely Jar Jar in disguise. Amidala found herself in trouble once again, after Gunray arrived on the planet and captured her. However, Binks and a [[Kwazel Maw]] called "[[Bogey (Kwazel Maw)|Bogey]]" happened to cause chaos among the Viceroy's guard; forcing him to attempt to escape, only to find himself at gunpoint. Gunray was confident Farr would rescue him from Amidala; however, he soon learned that the two Senators had planned to capture him the entire time.<ref name="Bombad Jedi" />

A Republic cruiser subsequently arrived and Gunray was taken into custody. While Farr requested that Amidala accept his apology for his brief betrayal, she remained adamant that it was the Republic that owed him an apology for forgetting that just because Rodia was not a particularly powerful ally did not make it any less important than any other system.<ref name="Bombad Jedi" />

Following the Gunray's capture and escape, Amidala was with Palpatine when he received word from Hondo Ohnaka's pirate gang that they had managed to capture the leader of the Separatists, Count Dooku. Being that Dooku was a powerful Sith Lord, the Jedi Council, the Chancellor and Amidala found it difficult to believe that mere pirates could capture him. Amidala counseled Palpatine, advising him to have the Council send two Jedi to confirm the validity of Hondo Ohnaka's claims before sending diplomats to deliver the ransom that he demanded.<ref name="Dooku Captured">{{TCW|Dooku Captured}}</ref>

====The Blue Shadow Virus crisis====
[[File:Clones and Padme in the CIS lab.png|thumb|right|250px|Amidala destroying battle droids before they can break out of Vindi's laboratory.]]
Amidala and Binks were then recalled to Naboo by Queen [[Neeyutnee]]. The queen revealed that a squad of battle droids had been found and destroyed onworld, and requested that Amidala petition the Senate or the Jedi Council to help protect Naboo. Unfortunately, Amidala knew that more evidence would be needed to warrant action by the Senate or the Jedi. She then took it upon herself to search the swamplands for signs of a greater Separatist presence on her homeworld; as had been indicated by a captured [[Unidentified T-series tactical droid (Naboo)|tactical droid]] and a bug on it.<ref name="Blue Shadow Virus">{{TCW|Blue Shadow Virus (episode)|Blue Shadow Virus}}</ref>

After following a tainted [[water]] stream, Amidala and Binks came across a hatch which they proved unable to open. Amidala was able to contact [[Captain]] [[Gregar Typho|Typho]] to give him the location of the [[Trade Federation laboratory|lab]]. During their attempts to open the hatch they became surrounded by battle droids and were swiftly captured. The pair was then taken before Separatist scientist, [[Doctor]] [[Nuvo Vindi]], who revealed that he had perfected the long thought eradicated disease, the [[Blue Shadow Virus]], which he planned to release into [[the galaxy]]. Fortunately, her Jedi allies Skywalker, Kenobi, and [[Ahsoka Tano]] arrived on Naboo to aid her. Tano, with the help of Gungan native [[Peppi Bow]], located the secret lab of Doctor Vindi.<ref name="Blue Shadow Virus" />

When Skywalker and his troops came to rescue her, Vindi threatened to kill Amidala and Binks. Following a struggle, Skywalker was able to rescue them. When Skywalker pursued Vindi, Amidala and Binks went with him and his troops. When they joined Tano and [[Rex]], Kenobi told them that Vindi had activated the bombs and that one of the bombs was missing. Amidala then remembered that Vindi had given a little [[LEP-86C8|droid]] the bomb. When everyone split up, the Naboo senator and Binks found the droid. At first, Amidala tried to get the bomb nicely back from the droid, but the droid growled at them and tried to run away with it. Luckily Jar Jar grabbed the droid and secured the bomb. Tano then brought the bomb squad and the bomb was deactivated. The Jedi and a squad of [[Cloning|clones]] were then able to captured Vindi for trial.<ref name="Blue Shadow Virus" />

Unfortunately as the Jedi prepared to take the mad scientist to trial on Coruscant, Amidala and the clones discovered that one of his virus bombs was missing the vial that contained the virus; meaning that it may have found its way into the wrong hands and could still be released.
As they had suspected, the virus had fallen into Separatist hands, Vindi's assistant droid, who released it within the laboratory, causing the facility to lockdown with Tano, Amidala, Binks, and several clones trapped inside. The few remaining battle droids then started slicing the exits, hoping to release the virus into Naboo's [[atmosphere]]. The remaining Republic forces in the lab began to pick off the droids before they could break out. While being attacked by droidekas, Amidala's biohazard suit was breached and she became infected with the virus.<ref name="Mystery of a Thousand Moons">{{TCW|Mystery of a Thousand Moons}}</ref>.

However, she persevered and eventually the remaining droids were destroyed. Amidala and Tano contacted Skywalker and Kenobi on the surface, telling them not to open the lab, so as to prevent the virus escaping. The transmission was cut off before Amidala could say her last goodbye to her husband, but Skywalker refused to abandon his wife to her fate. After the skirmish, two clone troopers died because of the virus. Subsequently Amidala said she that she hoped that their sacrifice would help bring peace to the [[galaxy]], a sentiment agreed to by Tano. Soon after, Tano herself lost consciousness, due to the virus. However, before the virus could kill Amidala and Tano, Skywalker and Kenobi arrived with the cure, freeing the survivors from the contaminated compound and ensuring that Naboo, and the galaxy itself, was safe from the virus.<ref name="Mystery of a Thousand Moons" />

====The Zillo Beast incident====
[[File:AmidalaZilloBeast.png|thumb|left|270px|Skywalker and Amidala on the roof of the Senate building]]
Following the [[Battle of Malastare]], Amidala spoke with Kenobi about the [[Zillo Beast]] that had been brought to Coruscant. Amidala hoped that she would be able to use her relationship with Skywalker and Palpatine to bring about the release of the creature. Although she was able to secure a meeting with Skywalker and Palpatine, she was cut short when the Zillo Beast escaped its confines, rampaging towards the [[Senate Building|Senate building]] to settle a personal vendetta against Palpatine after witnessing him order its death sentence.<ref name="The Zillo Beast Strikes Back">{{TCW|The Zillo Beast Strikes Back}}</ref>

Amidala, Skywalker and Palpatine, along with droids C-3PO and R2-D2, evacuated to Palpatine's personal escape shuttle, although they were grabbed by the beast's claws. Skywalker was able to cut the shuttle in half, releasing himself, Amidala and the droids out onto the sloped roof of the Senate building. Although Amidala had no means to stop her descent while sliding down the roof, she was soon caught by Skywalker. With the help of Yoda and [[Aayla Secura]], Skywalker then withstood the fatal toxin-attack against the Zillo Beast. Amidala and her companions survived the incident largely unscathed.<ref name="The Zillo Beast Strikes Back" />

====Spying on Senator Clovis====
[[File:DinnerForTwo-SS.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Amidala dining with Clovis.]]
Later, Amidala welcomed her secret husband home for a rare moment away from their duties, but was embittered when Anakin had to leave her for an urgent meeting with the Jedi Council. The Council had previously asked her to spy on her old friend Rush Clovis, who was suspected of working with the Separatists, but she had refused since she found the idea of spying on a colleague and an old friend unsettling. The Council neglected to tell her about the Separatist involvement, however, and she was left shocked when Anakin revealed these details whilst trying to steer her away from reconsidering. Still a bit angry over the previous night, and annoyed that Anakin was acting in a jealous manner, Amidala retracted her previous decision and accepted the mission to spy on Clovis. As part of her mission, Amidala befriended Clovis and agreed to accompany him on a trip to [[Cato Neimoidia]] to negotiate with the Trade Federation. She was accompanied by R2-D2 and Skywalker, who was aggressive towards Clovis during the trip for flirting with his wife. On one occasion, he damaged the seat beside Amidala's seat to prevent Clovis from sitting next to her. On takeoff, Skywalker even jerked the [[J-type Naboo star skiff|ship]] to prevent Clovis from kissing Amidala again.<ref name="Senate Spy" />

Upon arriving on Cato Neimoidia, Amidala and Clovis were greeted by the Trade Federation Senator [[Lott Dod]], who arranged for his servants to show Amidala to her quarters. While Skywalker and R2-D2 stayed on the ship to await further instructions, Amidala spied on Clovis, Dod, and the [[Geonosian]] [[Archduke]] [[Poggle the Lesser]], who were meeting in the garden. Clovis refused to lend anymore credits for the Separatists to build a new droid foundry on Geonosis. Amidala was unable to view their holographic blueprints since the Separatists had taken precautions to shut it down. Realizing that Clovis was infatuated with Amidala, Dod and Poggle connived to poison her in order to extract leverage from Clovis.<ref name="Senate Spy" />

During a formal dinner that night, Lott Dod tricked Amidala into sharing his drink, which had been contaminated with poison. Once dinner had finished, Clovis took Amidala on a tour of the palace. During the tour, Amidala began to succumb to the effects of the poison including thirst and head-throbbing. While Clovis went away to fetch her a drink, Amidala took the opportunity to access the palace's files and download the blueprints for the Separatist factory on Geonosis. She then contacted Skywalker and arranged for him to meet her in her quarters. Amidala also managed to steal a [[holodisc|hologram disc]].<ref name="Senate Spy" />

After making her way back to her quarters, Amidala passed the disc to Skywalker. Shortly later, she passed out in her chamber. Meanwhile, Clovis realized that Amidala was a [[spy]] after discovering that his holodisc was missing. Clovis strode into Amidala's quarters to confront her only to discover that she was unconscious and to encounter a furious Anakin Skywalker. Realizing Skywalker's love for Amidala, Clovis agreed to get the antidote in exchange for the holodisc. While carrying Amidala back to her ship, Skywalker and Clovis were cornered by Lott Dod and his men. After Clovis forced Dod at gunpoint to hand over the antidote, the three fled. However, Skywalker purposely left Clovis behind to face the wrath of Dod. Having escaped Dod, Skywalker injected the antidote into Amidala.<ref name="Senate Spy" />

====The Mandalorian crisis====
[[File:SKASOWKPAPMA-DoM.png|thumb|left|300px|Amidala (center), surrounded by Satine Kryze, Skywalker, Kenobi, Palpatine, and Mas Amedda.]]
Following her near-death encounter on Cato Neimoidia, Amidala took an interest in the growing instability on the planet [[Mandalore]]. While the [[New Mandalorians]]-led government wished to remain neutral, a hardline faction known as the [[Death Watch]] wanted to side with the Separatists. Following an assassination attempt on the Mandalorian [[Duke|Duchess]] [[Satine Kryze]], Amidala informed her friend the Duchess that the Galactic Senate had recently voted to occupy Mandalore and that warships were preparing to depart at sunrise. The Senate's decision had been influenced by a tampered holo-recording from the deceased [[Deputy Minister]] [[Jerec (Deputy Minister)|Jerec]], claiming that the planet was in crisis. In reality, Jerec had rejected Republic military intervention and stressed that it was an internal matter for the Mandalorians to handle alone.<ref name="Duchess of Mandalore">{{TCW|Duchess of Mandalore}}</ref>

Despite the Death's Watch efforts to stop Duchess Kryze from delivering the [[datacard]] containing Jerec's real recording to the Senate, the Duchess managed to delivered the card to Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, who then passed it to Amidala. When Chancellor Palpatine asked if any Senators objected to the Republic intervention on Mandalore, Amidala took the opportunity to present Jerec's real recording before the Galactic Senate. As a result, the Galactic Senate voted to recall the occupation force from hyperspace before it could land on Mandalore. Due to her efforts, Amidala won the praise and goodwill of Duchess Kryze.<ref name="Duchess of Mandalore" />

====Mission to Mandalore====
[[File:New Mandalorian ministry council.png|thumb|right|250px|Amidala speaks with the New Mandalorian Ruling Council.]]
Later, Amidala traveled to Mandalore, which was facing an economic crisis due to the disruption to trade caused by the Clone Wars. Due to the shortage of goods, smuggling had become a problem on that planet. During her visit to the Mandalorian capital of [[Sundari]], she did her best to assure Duchess Satine Kryze of aid from helpful factions in the Galactic Senate. Amidala's mission was complicated by the inability of the [[Ruling Council (New Mandalorians)/Legends|New Mandalorian Ruling Council's]] to adopt a common position on seeking aid from the Galactic Republic. Her visit also coincided with the arrival of a group of [[Moogan]] [[smuggler]]s imported a shipment of [[tea]] with a [[Poison|toxic]] chemical called slabin.<ref name="Corruption">{{TCW|Corruption}}</ref>

While visiting a [[Sundari Mandalorian hospital/Legends|hospital]], Amidala and Kryze were horrified to discover that a large number of children had been poisoned by an unknown substance. Since all of these students had attended the [[Sundari Mandalorian school/Legends|same school]], the two Senators quickly deduced that the poisoning had been caused by some contaminated foodstuffs. Amidala and Kryze decided to visit the school to investigate the poisoning. There, they discovered that the school's [[Ardees Beverage tea|tea drinks]] had been contaminated with slabin. After interrogating the [[Unidentified Sundari school superintendent|school's superintendent]], they learned that the school had sourced the tea from a middleman named [[Siddiq]], who was employed by a shipping company.<ref name="Corruption" />

[[File:PadmeSatineInvestigation-Corruption.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Amidala helping Duchess Satine to investigate the poisoning.]]
From Siddiq, Amidala and Kryze learned that the tea shipment had come from [[Mooga]] and that another shipment was due to arrive that night. That night, Amidala, Satine, and one of the Ducal guards infiltrated the pier in question and witnessed the shipment's arrival and the complicity of a customs officer. While the police captain initially denied that any criminal activity occurred in his jurisdiction, he changed his mind when he visited the dock warehouse where the tea was stored and saw the operation with himself. Following a skirmish with the Moogan smugglers, during which Amidala personally dispatched two of the smugglers after the police chief was injured, Satine had the warehouse and its contents burned down. Following the raid, Amidala and Kryze reported to [[Prime Minister]] [[Almec]], who was reluctant to acknowledge the corruption within the Mandalorian government but promised to investigate the matter. Before Amidala left, Satine suggested sending an undercover Jedi agent to investigate the [[Imperial Academy of Mandalore|Royal Academy of Government]], and Amidala promised to bring the matter before Master Yoda.<ref name="Corruption" />

====Brush with death on Alderaan====
Amidala later attended a [[Alderaan Conference on the Clone War Refugee Crisis|conference]] on the planet [[Alderaan]] that had been convened by Senator [[Bail Organa]] to address the plight of wartime refugees. Amidala was accompanied by Skywalker's Padawan Ahsoka Tano, who had been experiencing visions that the supposedly-dead bounty hunter [[Aurra Sing]] was planning to kill the Naboo senator. Prior to the conference, Amidala tried to assure Tano that she had felt the same sense of insecurity when she was Queen of Naboo. During the conference, Tano's fears proved founded when Aurra Sing shot Amidala while she was about to open her speech. Ahsoka's timely intervention prevented Sing from killing the Senator, who only sustained a shoulder wound. However, Sing managed to escaped capture.<ref name="Assassin">{{TCW|Assassin (episode)|Assassin}}</ref>

Following the failed assassination attempt, Tano devised a plan to capture Aurra Sing by having a [[BD-3000 luxury droid|luxury droid]], wreathed in a robe, take Amidala's place at the conference. Meanwhile, the real Amidala cast her speech through the droid via telecommunications from the safety of her private quarters. However, Sing saw through the plan and attempted to ambush Amidala. However, Tano sensed Sing's intentions through her precognitive abilities and intercepted her before the bounty hunter could carry out her second attempt. During a brief struggle, Sing managed to wound the Padawan, but was stunned by Amidala with a concealed blaster. Due to Tano's efforts to rescue her, Amidala developed a warm friendship with her. Later, Tano used her precognitive abilities to expose the imprisoned Hutt crime lord Ziro as the individual who had hired Sing to assassinate Amidala.<ref name="Assassin" />

====The blockade of Pantora====
Amidala was later present when Ahsoka Tano informed her master, Anakin Skywalker, that the newly elected [[Chairman]] of [[Pantora]] [[Baron]] [[Papanoida]]'s daughters [[Chi Eekway Papanoida|Chi Eekway]] and [[Che Amanwe Papanoida|Che Amanwe]] had been kidnapped. The kidnapping had coincided with a Trade Federation blockade of Pantora under the pretext that the planet had outstanding debts to pay. However, the blockade was merely a shadow-play by Count Dooku to force the [[Pantoran]]s to join the Separatist Alliance. With the consent of Skywalker, Tano traveled to Pantora with Senator [[Riyo Chuchi]] and succeeded in rescuing the girls and exposing the Trade Federation's links to the Separatists. Amidala herself had been supportive of Chuchi's efforts to get the Senate to intervene on Pantora's behalf, as the struggle reminded her of her own homeworld's similar plight.<ref name="Sphere of Influence">{{TCW|Sphere of Influence}}</ref>

====The Senate hostage crisis====
[[File:PadmeSenateHostageCrisis.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Amidala facing Cad Bane during the Senate hostage crisis.]]
While Amidala and Skywalker were arranging a party for her colleague Senator [[Aang]], they discovered that they were short on [[jogan fruit]], an essential ingredient in [[jogan fruit cake]]. Skywalker sent R2-D2 and C-3PO to buy jogan fruit from the market place in Coruscant. However, the two droids were then kidnapped by the bounty hunter [[Cad Bane]], who was working for the Separatists. Bane had been hired by the [[Grand Hutt Council]] to rescue Ziro from prison and had devised a plan which involved taking the Galactic Senate hostage. After extracting a layout of the Galactic Senate building from Artoo's databanks, Bane had the two droids [[memory wipe|mind-wiped]] and returned to their original places. Ignorant of Bane's plans, the two droids returned to their masters with the jogan fruit.<ref name="Evil Plans">{{TCW|Evil Plans}}</ref>

Shortly later, Bane and his associates, including the newly-freed Aurra Sing, put their plans into action. They infiltrated the Senate and overpowered the [[Senate Commando]]s guarding the entrance. Meanwhile, Amidala was talking with Skywalker in her [[Padmé's office|office]]. Her husband proposed taking her to somewhere in the galaxy for a few [[Standard week|weeks]] where no one would recognize them. Amidala declined since she was too focused on her work as a Senator. During their conversation, Skywalker even gave [[Skywalker's lightsaber|his lightsaber]] to Amidala to show her that he trusted her with his life. However, Skywalker was forced to hide when Organa and C-3PO entered Amidala's office. Organa had invited Amidala to attend a meeting of senators who were concerned about the new [[Enhanced Privacy Invasion Bill]]. Before she departed, Amidala hid Skywalker's [[lightsaber]] under her sleeve.<ref name="Hostage Crisis">{{TCW|Hostage Crisis}}</ref>

While Amidala and her colleagues were making their way to their meeting room, they were ambushed by Bane and his associates in the lobby. After securing the Senators, Bane issued an ultimatum to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and demanded the release of Ziro the Hutt. When Palpatine refused, Bane retaliated by locking down the entire building and severing all communications with the outside world. He took everyone's [[comlink]]s. Before he could search Amidala, Bane spotted Skywalker in the upper levels and sent his henchmen to pursue the Jedi. Following a protracted pursuit throughout the Senate Building's corridors, Bane's associates managed to capture the Jedi Knight. Amidala was present when Sing and [[Shahan Alama]] delivered an unconscious Skywalker to the lobby.<ref name="Hostage Crisis" />

Meanwhile, Chancellor Palpatine backed down and agreed to release Ziro. Prior to leaving, Bane and his bounty hunters planted several explosives in the lobby of the Senate building. Amidala tended to the wounded Skywalker and managed to rouse him. Skywalker then used his lightsaber to carve a hole around the senators and dropping everyone one floor down. This enabled Amidala and her colleagues to narrowly escape Bane's explosives, which exploded shortly after. Having achieved their objectives, Bane and Ziro departed offworld.<ref name="Hostage Crisis" />

====Meeting Madam Synata====
Following the hostage crisis, Amidala and Skywalker decided to take some time off. Thus, Amidala accepted an invitation from the legendary actress, Madam [[Risha Synata]].<ref name="SWA 12.1">{{IDWAdventuresCite|12|[[Intermission, Part I]]}}</ref>

====Peace mission to Raxus====
[[File:Palpatine and Padme HoBS.png|thumb|left|250px|Padme informs the Chancellor of the proposed peace accord. ]]
When the Galactic Senate began debating a [[Republic financial reform bill|bill]] that would eliminate government oversight of the InterGalactic Banking Clan in order to fund the Republic's military efforts, Amidala suggested opening negotiations with the Separatists to find a peaceful solution to the Clone Wars. Amidala's efforts were opposed by the war profiteering Senate representatives of the Trade Federation, the [[Techno Union]], and the InterGalactic Banking Clan: Lott Dod, [[Gume Saam]], and [[Nix Card]]. These senators conspired to sabotage Amidala's efforts by arranging for a Separatist attack on Coruscant.<ref name="Heroes on Both Sides">{{TCW|Heroes on Both Sides}}</ref>

Accompanied by Ahsoka, Amidala traveled behind enemy lines to the planet [[Raxus]] to meet her old friend and mentor Senator [[Mina Bonteri]], who had joined the Separatist cause. After a tense but cordial reunion, Amidala and Bonteri agreed to initiate a motion to petition the Galactic Senate and the [[Separatist Senate]] to discuss a diplomatic solution to the Clone Wars. The Separatist Parliament approves of the motion by a majority vote with the exception of a few dissenting votes including the [[Corporate Alliance]].<ref name="Heroes on Both Sides" />

While Count Dooku publicly supported the motion, he gave secret orders for [[General]] [[Grievous]] to deposit a [[Demolition droid|group of droids disguised as sanitary units]] on Coruscant to commit acts of sabotage. These droids managed to [[Bombing of Coruscant's central power distribution grid|blow up]] the [[Federal District|Senate District's]] [[central power distribution grid]]; creating a massive power outage which coincided with the Senate's hearing on the Separatist peace proposal. This terror attack succeeded in hardening the Senate's stance towards the Separatists and it passed a bill deregulating the banks. As a result, Amidala's diplomatic efforts to end the Clone Wars came to naught.<ref name="Heroes on Both Sides" />

====Murders in the Senate====
Subsequently, [[Kamino]]an senator [[Halle Burtoni]] proposed a [[Republic military enhancement bill|bill]] for the creation of five million more clone troopers. Amidala and Organa argued against the proposal in the Senate; it was then Dooku sent them a message informing them Bonteri had been killed during an [[Attack on Confederate people|attack]] he attributed to the Republic. Opponents to the bill were dissuaded to vote by threats, while she, Farr and Organa were attacked by the bounty hunters [[Robonino]] and [[Chata Hyoki]]. Organa was injured, so Amidala made an impassioned speech against taking away any more credits from social services in his stead, which was broadcast on the [[HoloNet]].<ref name="Pursuit of Peace">{{TCW|Pursuit of Peace}}</ref>

At a subsequent toast, Farr suddenly died. After his [[Funeral of Onaconda Farr|funeral]], Palpatine summoned her and Farr's [[aide]] [[Lolo Purs]] to his office, where [[Inspector]] [[Tan Divo]] revealed Farr had been poisoned. Amidala suspected [[Umbaran]] senator [[Mee Deechi]], but after he was murdered too, suspicion fell on Burtoni. Amidala deduced Purs murdered Farr when Divo stated the poison, which only affected Rodians, had been in all their drinks, and realized she did not drink at the toast. After she got Purs to confess, she apprehended her with a punch to the face. Afterwards, Burtoni's bill was approved.<ref name="Senate Murders">{{TCW|Senate Murders}}</ref>

====Later wartime activities====
Amidala and her husband participated in the [[Battle of Mon Cala]],<ref name="Water War">{{TCW|Water War}}</ref><ref name="Gungan Attack">{{TCW|Gungan Attack}}</ref><ref name="Prisoners">{{TCW|Prisoners}}</ref> and then a [[skirmish on Naboo]].<ref name="Shadow Warrior">{{TCW|Shadow Warrior}}</ref> Meanwhile, she sent C-3PO and R2-D2 on a humanitarian mission to [[Aleen]].<ref name="Mercy Mission">{{TCW|Mercy Mission}}</ref><ref name="Nomad Droids">{{TCW|Nomad Droids}}</ref>

She then attended a [[Confederate–Republic peace conference]] on Mandalore. Present was Mina's son [[Lux Bonteri]], who had followed her into the Separatist Senate, who accused Dooku of being behind his mother's death. Amidala feared a reprisal, and asked Ahsoka Tano to protect him.<ref name="A Friend in Need">{{TCW|A Friend in Need}}</ref>

Amidala attended Obi-Wan Kenobi's [[Funeral of Obi-Wan Kenobi|funeral]] after he was believed killed by [[Rako Hardeen]], which was actually a scheme to infiltrate a planned kidnapping of Palpatine by having Kenobi impersonate Hardeen.<ref name="Deception">{{TCW|Deception}}</ref> Amidala welcomed Palpatine when he came to Naboo for the [[Festival of Light]]. As the [[Skirmish in Theed|attack]] got underway, Ahsoka escorted Amidala and the other delegates to safety. The next morning, Amidala thanked the Jedi on the Naboo's behalf for protecting the Chancellor. When Dooku made another attempt to kidnap the Chancellor, she arrived with the [[Palace Guard (Naboo)|Palace Guard]] to protect him.<ref name="Crisis on Naboo">{{TCW|Crisis on Naboo}}</ref>

====Defending Ahsoka Tano====
{{Quote|Look at the facts. Letta Turmond called Ahsoka to her cell to reveal the name of the true mastermind behind the bombing of the Jedi Temple. Letta told Ahsoka she was afraid. She told her that the mastermind was a Jedi, and before she could reveal the Jedi's name, Letta Turmond was strangled to death by way of the Force. Why would Ahsoka kill Letta with a method that would so obviously tie the murder to her? A Jedi may be responsible for the murder, but that Jedi is not Ahsoka Tano. Members of the court, you are prosecuting the wrong Jedi!|Padmé Amidala, before the Republic court|The Wrong Jedi}}
[[File:AmidalaTanoLegalCouncil-TWJ.png|thumb|right|260px|Amidala represents Ahsoka Tano in her trial.]]
After Ahsoka Tano was expelled from the Jedi Order for her alleged role in a [[Bombing of the Jedi Temple hangar|bombing]] and the subsequent murder of [[Letta Turmond]], Padmé Amidala agreed to defend the former Padawan during her trial before the Senate. During the court proceedings, she argued that if Tano had really been the culprit, she would not have left a lot of incriminating material behind nor have committed the murder of Turmond in a way that would so easily implicate her. Admiral [[Wilhuff Tarkin]], the prosecutor, was unconvinced and pointed out that Tano was seen collaborating with a known Separatist&mdash;Asajj Ventress. As the court's judge Chancellor Palpatine was about to read the verdict, Anakin Skywalker burst in with some [[Jedi Temple Guard]]s and revealed that the real culprit was in fact [[Barriss Offee]]. Offee finally confessed her crimes and all charges against Tano were dropped.<ref name="The Wrong Jedi">{{TCW|The Wrong Jedi}}</ref> However, Tano refused an offer to rejoin the Jedi Order and sought to discover a new path for herself.<ref name="Tano DB">{{Databank|ahsoka-tano|Ahsoka Tano|archivedate=20170806140940}}</ref>

====Mission to Batuu====
[[File:Thrawn Alliances Padmé poster.png|left|thumb|281x281px|Amidala on Batuu]]
Later, Amidala received a message from one of her former handmaiden, [[Duja]]. Duja's message came from [[Batuu]], a world at the edge of the Outer Rim near the [[Unknown Regions]].<ref name="Thrawn Alliances">''[[Thrawn: Alliances]]''</ref>

====Mission to Scipio====
Later, Amidala went on a diplomatic [[mission to Scipio]], where she reunited with Clovis and uncovered corruption at the InterGalactic Banking Clan. They were targeted by [[Embo]], but Anakin saved them.<ref name="An Old Friend">{{TCW|An Old Friend}}</ref> Clovis became head of the Banking Clan,<ref name="The Rise of Clovis">{{TCW|The Rise of Clovis}}</ref> but she discovered he had done it on Dooku's behalf, raising interest rates for the Republic before Separatist forces came to occupy Scipio. Amidala warned Anakin, and the Republic [[Invasion of Scipio|attacked]], seizing control of the banks, while Clovis committed [[suicide]].<ref name="Crisis at the Heart">{{TCW|Crisis at the Heart}}</ref>

====Vos and Ventress====
{{Quote|Ventress isn't capable of anything as selfless as love. And Vos couldn't possibly have cared about a murderess like her. Besides, she's the one who took him to the dark side in the first place.''"<br />"''Stranger things have happened. And maybe, if she loves him, she's his way back from it.|Skywalker and Amidala discuss Vos and Ventress' relationship|Dark Disciple}}
After Dooku's former [[Sith apprentice]] [[Asajj Ventress]] was formally pardoned of her crimes after helping to [[Rescue of Quinlan Vos|rescue]] Master [[Quinlan Vos]] from Dooku, Anakin Skywalker discussed details about their involvement in the Jedi Council's mission to assassinate Count Dooku. Knowing that Amidala would not approve of such an action, he claimed that it was merely a mission to capture Dooku. Anakin also voiced his concerns that the Jedi had not informed the Supreme Chancellor about the operation. When Amidala asked Skywalker about his thoughts on the mission, he expressed his discomfort with Ventress.<ref name="Dark Disciple">''[[Dark Disciple]]''</ref>

When Amidala queried about Ventress' claims that Vos had turned to the [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]], Skywalker theorized that she had seduced the Jedi Master. Skywalker then went on to criticize Vos and Ventress for pursuing a romantic relationship; something that was forbidden under the [[Jedi Code]]. When Skywalker realized that he too was embroiled in a romantic relationship with Amidala, she reassured him that they were genuinely in love. After Skywalker remarked that Ventress was incapable of love due to her dark side background, Padmé responded that Ventress's love for Vos could lead him back to the light side.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

====Pregnancy====
{{Quote|Something wonderful has happened. Ani, I'm pregnant.|Padmé Amidala revealed to Anakin Skywalker she's pregnant|Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith}}
[[File:PregnancyRevealed.png|thumb|right|300px|Padme reveals her pregnancy to Anakin shortly after the Battle of Coruscant.]]
As the [[Outer Rim Sieges]] raged on, Amidala had fewer opportunities to see her husband. While she did become pregnant, she was unable to share this news with Skywalker until after the [[Battle of Coruscant]]. The news, while exciting for both parents, placed them in a bind as it threatened to reveal their [[marriage]]. Meanwhile, Skywalker began suffering from nightmares foreshadowing the death of Amidala. Not wanting to risk this and suffer the same pain when his mother died, Skywalker turned to Jedi Master Yoda for advice without revealing too much of his fears. Yoda advised that to overcome his nightmares and fears, Skywalker had to learn to let go to those close to him, something that did not sit well with Skywalker. His fears for Amidala increasing, Skywalker turned to his close friend, Chancellor Palpatine, who revealed to him that the Sith Lord [[Darth Plagueis|Plagueis the Wise]] had come close to learning the power of [[immortality]]. Meanwhile, Amidala became increasingly concerned with the events of the war and power held by Palpatine and the increasing rift this was causing between herself and Skywalker.<ref name="Episode III" /> Padmé then joined a [[Delegation of 2,000|group]] of senators that were wary of Palpatine's policies and discussed ways of stopping him.<ref name="Seeds of Rebellion">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars: ''Episode III'' Revenge of the Sith'']] [http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Scenes_cut_from_Star_Wars#Revenge_of_the_Sith deleted scene]—"Seeds of Rebellion" This deleted scene was canonized in such sources as Padmé Amidala's Databank entry and ''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''.</ref>

When the Jedi discovered Palpatine's identity as the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, they attempted to arrest him. Palpatine killed three of them before being defeated by Mace Windu. However, Skywalker interfered, slicing off Windu's hand, giving Sidious the opportunity to kill the Jedi. Skywalker, seeing Sidious as the only way to save his wife, pledged himself to the dark side. Sidious then initiated [[Order 66]] declaring the Jedi to be traitors to the Republic. Across the galaxy, Jedi were murdered by their own soldiers, while on Coruscant Skywalker led the 501st to the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]] where they slaughtered everyone within, setting the ancient structure ablaze in the process. Knowing that her husband was in the Temple, but unaware of the true circumstances of why he was there, Amidala watched fearfully and horror-stricken from her apartment as the Jedi Temple burned. When Skywalker arrived at her apartment unharmed, he informed her that the Jedi had become traitors but that his loyalties stayed with the chancellor. He then left for the planet [[Mustafar]] to put an end to the leaders of the Separatist Alliance. Amidala meanwhile attended a meeting of the Senate where the chancellor [[Proclamation of the New Order|declared]] the formation of the [[Galactic Empire]] and himself as [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]]. While thousands of her colleagues applauded, Amidala was despondent; she remarked, with tears in her eyes that, "this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause".

===Meeting on Mustafar===

[[File:PregnantDyingPadme.PNG|thumb|left|230px|The heavily-pregnant Amidala lies unconscious after being choked by Vader.]]
After the birth of the Empire, Amidala was visited by Obi-Wan Kenobi who revealed to her that Skywalker had turned to the dark side and that he needed her help in stopping him. Amidala refused though, and Kenobi correctly identified Skywalker as the father of the baby she was carrying. He then left, but later followed Amidala into her starship as she left Coruscant for Mustafar to meet Skywalker. Upon her arrival, she was horrified to find that Obi-Wan had been correct: Skywalker had succumbed fully to the dark side and was now the Sith Lord Darth Vader. She tried to convince him to simply leave and help raise their child, but he instead went on an intense speech of how he could overthrow the Emperor and they could rule the galaxy together. Now sobbing with fear and horror, Amidala backed away from the man who wore her husband's face but no longer seemed to be him and implored that he was breaking her heart. As she begged for him to stop going down this dark path, Skywalker's eyes burned and he screamed out that she was lying. Unbeknownst to Amidala, Obi-Wan had stowed away on her ship knowing she would go to verify the truth of his claims, but this proved to be fatal for her. Under the impression that his wife had turned against him and brought the Jedi to kill him, Vader seized her with the [[the Force]] and began to [[Force choke|choke]] her. After one more desperate plea, Vader released her and she fell unconscious.<ref name="Episode III" />

After Kenobi defeated Vader in a brutal lightsaber [[Lightsaber combat|fight]], he retrieved the unconscious Amidala and brought her to a medical facility on [[Polis Massa]] where she would give birth two days later.<ref name="Siege of Lothal Recon" />  According to the [[GH-7 medical droid|medical droid]], Amidala had lost the will to live - despite the fact that she was completely healthy, the medics stated that her body began to shut down, for reasons they couldn't explain. However, she held on long enough to give birth to twins, whom she named as [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]] and [[Leia Organa|Leia]]. Despite all what happened on Mustafar, Amidala still believed that Skywalker held some good in him, a belief she shared with Kenobi before she died. Obi-Wan then had her corpse returned to Naboo so she could be laid to rest. Her [[Funeral of Padmé Amidala|funeral]] was attended by hundreds of people who mourned the loss of their beloved Senator and former Queen. Darth Vader, upon being rescued by Darth Sidious and then placed in a [[Vader's armor|life supporting suit]], asked after his wife. Sidious informed him that in his anger, it appeared that he had killed Amidala. This fueled Vader's anger even more to a destructive level.<ref name="Episode III" />

===Legacy===
{{Quote|Terex, you know those gowns belonged to one of the great heroes of galactic history, no? Padmé Amidala.|[[Lor San Tekka]], to Terex|Poe Dameron 24: Legend Found, Part V}}
Amidala's death haunted Vader for the rest of his life. Despite the supremely brutal and ruthless being the Sith Lord became, he could never let go of the emotional agony caused by his wife's passing.<ref name="Beware">''[[Return of the Jedi: Beware the Power of the Dark Side!]]''</ref>

[[Standard decade|Decades]] later, Leia Organa would remember an impression she had of her mother as being very beautiful, kind, but sad.<ref name="RotJ">[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]</ref> However, Organa was unsure if she really did ever see her mother or just invented these memories to fill the hole in her life.<ref name="Beware" />

[[File:Anakinredeemed.png|thumb|left|250px|The good Anakin, after his return, and shortly before his death]]
The fact that Amidala had given birth to twins was a secret known only to a few after her death: the [[mortician]] [[Commodex Tahn]] used a hologram to make her still appear pregnant during her funeral.<ref name="DarthVader10">''[[Darth Vader 10: Shadows and Secrets, Part IV]]''</ref> Nineteen years later, her children met for the first time during the [[Galactic Civil War]]—they did not, however, know that they were siblings.<ref name="ANH">[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]</ref> Vader later learned that Luke was his son and that Amidala had indeed given birth,<ref name="DarthVader10" /> and he attempted to seduce Luke to the dark side of the Force. Luke remained true, however, and ultimately learned that Leia was his sister from Obi-Wan Kenobi. During the [[Battle of Endor]], Luke set out to redeem his father from the dark side of the Force. During their duel, Vader searched Luke's thoughts and discovered Amidala had also given birth to a daughter. Luke's efforts were eventually successful; Sidious attempted to kill Luke with a barrage of Force lightning, but Vader stepped in to rescue his son and kill the Emperor. Vader, once again Anakin Skywalker, died as a result of the injuries he sustained in killing the Emperor, but not before proving Amidala's final words correct: there was still good within Darth Vader.<ref name="RotJ" />

The [[Padmé Amidala's wardrobe|gowns]] owned by Amidala were kept on Naboo for many years after her death. Eventually, the gowns found their way to Organa. Because Organa only knew Amidala from the things she owned and the stories told to her by people who had known her, the gowns meant a lot to her and she kept them stored in a safe location.<ref name="Poe Dameron 21">''[[Poe Dameron 21: Legend Found, Part II]]''</ref> The gowns, however, were thrown into hyperspace by [[Terex]] of the [[First Order]] after he [[Mission to Cato Neimoidia (Resistance)|kidnapped]] [[Leia Organa's ship|Organa's ship]] on Cato Neimoidia.<ref name="Poe Dameron 24">''[[Poe Dameron 24: Legend Found, Part V]]''</ref>

==Personality and traits==
Amidala was compassionate to other people and stood her ground firmly for what she believed in.<ref name="Episode II" /> Amidala was very persuasive and empathetic speaker during her time as Senator,<ref name="Episode III" /> especially when she opposed the escalation of the Clone Wars.<ref name="Heroes on Both Sides" /> She even started to doubt the Republic when the Senate gave Palpatine more executive powers near the end of the Clone Wars.<ref name="Episode III" /> Amidala could not ignore her people need and accepted Queen Jamillia's offer to become senator after two terms as queen. Due her reputation as a beloved former monarch, Amidala kept several privileges such as her wardrobe and a chrome-plated ships when she became Senator.<ref name="Episode II" />

Amidala was both responsible and strong willed who did what she believed to the right course of action despite objections from those closest to her. She spoke her mind to the Senate and was able to convince the Gungan to unite against the Trade Federation.<ref name="Episode I" /> Amidala could be seen as fearless when she refused additional security to protect herself from assassins. She also did not like the idea of leaving during the vote on the Military Creation Act. When Skywalker came back into her life, Amidala knew that their future together would endanger ther lives. However, she gave and married Skywalker in secret.<ref name="Episode II" />

Always at the center of the galaxy, Amidala was a determined and brave survivor.<ref name="Padmé's Card">{{ForceCollection|Padmé Amidala [In Disguise]|star=3}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:PadmeconceptMustafar.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Concept art for Padmé Amidala]]
Padmé Amidala was first mentioned in the [[1983]] film [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']].<ref name="RotJ" /> Amidala eventually appeared onscreen for the first time in the [[1999]] film [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']], played by actress [[Natalie Portman]].<ref name="Episode I" /> [[Catherine Taber]] voiced Amidala in the [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' film]] and subsequent [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|TV series]].

In her interview on the "[[Wikipedia:Inside the Actors Studio|Inside the Actors Studio]]" program, Portman admitted that, when her agent first mentioned the new ''Star Wars'' trilogy to her, she didn't know the difference between ''[[memoryalpha:Star Trek|Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]''. Portman also missed the first screening of ''The Phantom Menace'' due to exams.<ref name="bbc">{{Cite web |publisher=BBC |title=Natalie Portman interview|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2004/12/03/natalie_portman_garden_state_interview.shtml|accessdate=January 18, 2013}}</ref>

Amidala's first appearance was not actually in ''The Phantom Menace'', rather in ''[[The Last Command 5]]'',<ref name="Last Command 5">''[[The Last Command 5]]''</ref> the fifth issue of the comic book adaptation of [[Timothy Zahn]]'s [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] [[1993]] novel ''[[The Last Command]]''.<ref name="Last Command">''[[The Last Command]]''</ref>

According to concept artist [[Iain McCaig]], Padmé was meant to make an attempt on Darth Vader's life on Mustafar: the scene as originally storyboarded had her embracing him with a knife, but finding herself unable to actually kill him (her role in the ''Revenge of the Sith'' script also reflected that she realized Anakin was becoming a monster).<ref name="Original fate">{{cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/hitfix/star-wars-padme-original-revenge-sith-ending/|title=Padme's Original Fate In 'Star Wars' Was Much More Badass|work=Uproxx|date=2017-05-15|first=Donna|last=Dickens|accessdate=2017-05-15}}</ref>

===Name origin===
"Padmé" is [[Wikipedia:Sanskrit|Sanskrit]] for "lotus flower", while "Amidala" is a variant of "Amitabha", which means a spiritual manifestation.<ref name="Sanskrit Wikipedia page">[[Wikipedia:Sanskrit|Sanskrit]]</ref> In [[Wikipedia:Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian Arabic]], the name "Nabirye" means "Mother of Twins". Padmé's own surname, Naberrie, appears to be a homonym, considering that she eventually gives birth to Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa.<ref name="Egyptian Arabic Wikipedia page">[[Wikipedia:Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian Arabic]]</ref>
