{{Quote|Zeb is the muscle of the group. He's great at smashing things, including things he doesn't mean to smash.|Ezra Bridger|A New Hero}}
'''Garazeb Orrelios''', commonly known as '''Zeb''', was a [[Sexes|male]] [[Lasat]] rebel who manned the [[starship]] ''[[Ghost]]''. Prior to joining the [[Spectres]] rebel cell, Zeb was a [[Captain]] of the [[Lasan High Honor Guard|Lasan Honor Guard]] and was trained to fight with a [[bo-rifle]]. He was one of the few Lasat to survive the devastation of his homeworld of [[Lasan]] and as a result developed a deep hatred towards the Empire. As a member of the Lothal rebel cell led by the [[Twi'lek]] [[Hera Syndulla]] and the [[Jedi]] [[Kanan Jarrus]], Zeb took part in numerous raids and mission against the Empire. While temperamental and volatile, Zeb was compassionate and had a strong moral compass.

Zeb was affected by the trauma of witnessing the destruction of his homeworld Lasan. Despite his skepticism towards spiritual matters, Zeb took a leap of faith when he at the urging of his fellow Lasat compatriots [[Chava]] and [[Gron]] used his bo-rifle to guide the ''Ghost'' through a collapsed star cluster to the original Lasat homeworld of [[Lira San]]. Zeb regained his confidence by discovering that he was not the last Lasat. Later, Zeb developed an unlikely friendship with his nominal enemy the [[Imperial Security Bureau]] [[Agent]] [[Alexsandr Kallus|Kallus]] when the two were forced to work together to survive on the icy moon of [[Bahryn]]. Due to Zeb's friendship, Kallus later joined the Rebellion.

After learning they were part of a larger rebel network, Zeb and his fellow rebels would continue fighting against threats such as [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], the [[Inquisitorius|Inquisitors]], the former Sith [[Maul]], and [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]]. At times, Zeb and his fellow rebels worked with criminal elements such as the [[pirate]] [[Hondo Ohnaka]] and the [[crime lord]] [[Azmorigan]]. While Zeb did not get on with the droids [[C1-10P|Chopper]] and [[AP-5]], the three gained a better respect for each other when they joined forces to defeat the [[E-XD infiltrator droid]] [[EXD-9]].

Zeb remained a member of the Spectres as the rebel groups formed the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]]. Following the [[Battle of Atollon]], Zeb contributed to Ezra's [[Liberation of Lothal]]. After the [[Battle of Endor]], Zeb and his former adversary Kallus traveled to Lira San together as friends.

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Quote|I was there when Lasan fell. I know why you fear those disruptors. I gave the order to use them.|Agent Kallus taunting Zeb about the destruction of his homeworld|Droids in Distress}}
When Zeb was a child, he had [[Garazeb Orrelios' friend|a friend]] that was attacked by a [[Unidentified creature (Garazeb Orrelios)|a creature]] in a underground [[cave]]. His friend's [[Garazeb Orrelios' friend's brother|brother]] later saved this friend from the creature, and was never seen again.<ref name="Becoming Hunted">{{SWRMCite|10|Becoming Hunted}}</ref> Later Zeb was recruited as a member of the [[Lasan High Honor Guard|Honor Guard of Lasan]], in which he received combat and military training, as well as his [[Bo-rifle]], the weapon of the Honor Guard. He held the rank of Captain and was charged with protecting the [[royal family (Lasan)|Lasan royal family]] and his people.<ref name="Legends of the Lasat">{{Rebels|Legends of the Lasat}}</ref>. All that came to an end when the [[Galactic Empire]] devastated Lasan with [[T-7 ion disruptor rifle]]s and utterly wiped out nearly all of his people including his family, save for his [[Garazeb Orrelios's grandmother|grandmother]]. Due to these events, Zeb harbored a deep hatred for the Empire.<ref name="Rebels Visual Guide" /> Zeb had nightmares about the Imperials disintegrating his people.<ref name="SW:AEYNTK">''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know]]''</ref> By the age of 39, he had joined the [[Spectres]] rebel cell in their fight for freedom against the Empire. This small rebel band, which operated primarily on [[Lothal]] by the year [[4 BBY]], consisted of the Twi'lek ship captain [[Hera Syndulla]], the undercover [[Jedi]] [[Kanan Jarrus]], the [[Mandalorian]] teenager [[Sabine Wren]], and the [[astromech droid]] [[C1-10P]]. The Spectres operated from the ''[[Ghost]]'', a [[VCX-100 light freighter]] which had an auxiliary ship called the ''[[Phantom]]''.<ref name="Rebels Visual Guide" /> At some point, Orrelios also befriended [[Mindiz]], a young girl whose [[parent]]s had been taken away for trying to prevent the Empire from seizing their land.<ref name="Sabotaged">{{SWRMCite|7|Sabotaged Supplies}}</ref>

===Age of the Empire===
====The Spectres====
{{Quote|Zeb, are you embarrassing the Imperials again?''"<br>"''Honestly, Kanan, it's hard not to.|Kanan and Zeb discussing the latter's diversionary attack|Rise of the Rebels}}
[[File:Zeb stormtrooper nightmare.png|thumb|left|220px|Zeb enjoyed beating up stormtroopers.]]
During one mission on Lothal, Garazeb Orrelios was required to rendezvous with the former Jedi Kanan Jarrus in an alleyway in Lothal's [[Capital City]]. Zeb arrived at the wrong alley, and found two [[Stormtrooper]]s harassing an [[Ugnaught]] vendor and his astromech [[droid]]. Protecting the Ugnaught, Zeb found himself in a brawl with several stormtroopers and a [[TIE fighter pilot]] named [[Flight baron|Baron]] [[Valen Rudor]]. In their haste to take Zeb down, they accidentally destroyed a [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighter]]. Zeb strolled out of the wreckage to meet the grateful Ugnaught vendor who offered Zeb [[credit]]s as a reward, which he refused in lieu of one of the vendor's [[Jogan fruit|fruits]]. Zeb's brief entanglement with the Imperials annoyed Kanan, who was unhappy with Zeb for being late and stirring up unnecessary trouble with the Imperials.<ref name="Entanglement" />

====Enter Ezra Bridger====
{{Quote|First you ditch me, then you hit me?''"<br>"''How was I supposed to know it was you? You were wearing a bucket!|Ezra and Zeb|Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion}}
Later, Zeb along with fellow rebels Kanan Jarrus and Sabine Wren stole several Imperial crates containing [[blaster]]s in Lothal's Capital City. However, a young [[human]] street urchin named [[Ezra Bridger]] stole their goods and fled on a stolen [[speeder bike]]; prompting Zeb and Kanan to pursue him. Under Kanan's orders, he evaded the pursuit and was left with the stolen crates, saying he would end Ezra if Kanan caught him. Zeb and his fellow Rebels regrouped aboard the ''Ghost'' and picked up Ezra as he was being chased by TIE fighters. From the start, Zeb did not get on well with the young stowaway and had him tossed into the ship's closet after Ezra made fun of his body odor.<ref name="Spark of Rebellion">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion]]''</ref>

Zeb and the Rebels were able to escape their Imperial pursuers and returned to Lothal where they landed near [[Lothal re-settlement camp 43]], known by the locals as "Tarkintown," named after [[Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]] and the home to farmers who lost their farmlands to the Empire. After selling the stolen blasters to the [[Devaronian]] [[crime lord]] [[Cikatro Vizago]], the rebels used the proceeds to buy food for the residents of Tarkintown. From Vizago, the rebels also acquired the flight plan for an Imperial [[Gozanti-class cruiser|''Gozanti''-class cruiser]] full of [[Wookiee]] prisoners. When Ezra gatecrashed their meeting by falling through the ship's air duct, Zeb and the ship's astromech droid C1-10P voted to get rid of the boy, whom the former labeled a "[[Loth-rat]]." However, the other crew members disagreed and Ezra was permitted to stay.<ref name="Spark of Rebellion" />

[[File:Rare Hairless Wookiee.png|thumb|220px|Zeb pretending to be a "rare hairless Wookiee".]]
As planned, Zeb and the rebels managed to dock with the Imperial ''Gozanti'' cruiser using the ruse that [[Governor]] Wilhuff Tarkin had ordered them to transfer a Wookiee captive. As part of the mission, Zeb posed as a hairless Wookiee in order to allow the rebels to board the ship. However, Zeb was unwilling to give the Imperials a chance to buy his ruse and instead knocked them unconscious. Unfortunately, Zeb and the Rebels had no idea they were walking into a trap until Ezra came to warn them. When Ezra got captured by [[Agent]] [[Alexsandr Kallus|Kallus]], Zeb regretfully abandoned him so they could escape, but not before telling Ezra he did good. However, Zeb's rebel companions were displeased with his actions towards Zeb and voted to rescue the young human.<ref name="Spark of Rebellion" />

Zeb and his rebel companions infiltrated the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|Imperial Star Destroyer]] ''[[Lawbringer]]'' and succeeded in rescuing Ezra, who had already managed to escaped his detention cell. During their reunion in the Star Destroyer's hangar bay, Zeb mistook Ezra for a stormtrooper due to his stolen Imperial helmet and punched him in the head. After a brief blaster skirmish with Agent Kallus and his stormtroopers, the rebels managed to escape aboard the ''Ghost''. Following their escape from the Star Destroyer, Zeb informed his fellow rebels that the Wookiees were being transported to the mining world of [[Kessel]]. The rebels then traveled to Kessel to rescue the Wookiees.<ref name="Spark of Rebellion" />

The ''Ghost'' managed to slip through Kessel's orbital security and land at the mining platform where the Wookiee slaves were disembarking. While Hera and Chopper remained aboard the ''Ghost'' and dodged TIE fighters, Zeb and the other rebels landed on the platform and proceeded to free the slaves. The rebels were quickly attacked by stormtroopers led by Agent Kallus, who had followed them to Kessel. During the skirmish, Kanan revealed his Jedi identity by using his [[lightsaber]] to deflect blaster bolts. Meanwhile, Zeb and Sabine herded the Wookiees into an empty shipping container while Ezra rescued the Wookiee cub [[Kitwarr]], the son of the Wookiee leader [[Wullffwarro]]. The ''Ghost'' managed to extract the shipper container with the freed Wookiees and the rebels. Following their mission, the ''Ghost'' traveled to Lothal to return Ezra. Prior to Ezra disembarking, Ezra stole Kanan's lightsaber with the intention of keeping it as a souvenir. However, Kanan managed to convince Ezra to become his Jedi [[Padawan]] and to join their crew.<ref name="Spark of Rebellion" />

====Stealing the T-7 disruptors====
{{Quote|Maybe you can cut Zeb a little slack today. Do you know what a T-7 disruptor is? What it does to an organic being?''"<br>"''Uh, no...''"<br>"''Well, Zeb knows. Because it's what the Imperials used on his people when they cleared his homeworld. Very few Lasat survived. And none remain on Lasan.|Hera explaining Zeb's predicament to Ezra|Droids in Distress}}
[[File:Kallus bo-rifle.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Zeb duels Kallus on Lothal.]]
Running low on supplies and [[fuel]], Zeb and the crew of the ''Ghost'' reluctantly accepted a [[Mission to steal Imperial weapons|mission]] from the Devaronian crime lord Cikatro Vizagoto to steal a cargo shipment from the Imperial [[Minister]] [[Maketh Tua]]. During this mission, Zeb and his rebel companions Kanan, Ezra, Sabine, and Chopper boarded [[Star Commuter 2000]] [[shuttle]] [[ST-45]] to the nearby planet of [[Garel]]. Traveling undercover, Zeb pretended to be Sabine's ward. Aboard the shuttle was the Imperial Minister Tua herself, who was negotiating the arrangement with [[Aqualish]] arms dealer [[Amda Wabo]]. With Wabo only able to speak in his [[Aqualish (language)|native tongue]], Lothal's minister borrowed [[Senator]] [[Bail Organa]]'s [[protocol droid]] [[C-3PO]], along with his counterpart astromech, [[R2-D2]] to translate the deal.<ref name="Droids in Distress">{{Rebels|Droids in Distress}}</ref>

As the ship entered hyperspace, Bridger and Chopper started a ruckus, causing Jarrus to request that the astromech droid be moved to the back of the shuttle. The [[RX-24|pilot]] complies, but in retaliation Bridger demanded that Tua's droids be sent to the back as well. Despite her protest, the droids were ordered to go back, leaving the minister without an interpreter. Zeb then offered Sabine's services as a translator which Tua gladly accepted. Sabine found out from Wabo that the cargo shipment was located on Garel's Hangar Bay Seven but misled Tua into believing that it was in Hangar Bay Seventeen. After disembarking on Garel, Zeb and his rebel companions headed to Bay Seven where they found their cargo shipment. <ref name="Droids in Distress" />

Much to Zeb's horror, the shipment turned out to be T-7 ion disruptor rifles: weapons that were banned by the [[Imperial Senate]] because they were capable of short circuiting an entire ship or a vehicle. However, Zeb disputed the official reason for the ban; knowing that these weapons had contributed to the near-destruction of his species. Before the Spectres could load the dangerous contraband into the ''Ghost'' which was parked in nearby Hangar Bay Eight, the rebels were confronted by Minister Tua, Wabo, C-3PO, R2-D2, and several stormtroopers. While Zeb held back the Imperials with his bo-rifle, Ezra, Kanan, and Sabine loaded the T-7 rifles into the ''Ghost''. During the skirmish, the two droids C-3PO and R2-D2 fled aboard the ''Ghost'' and became unwilling passengers for a short period.<ref name="Droids in Distress" />

While traveling through hyperspace, Zeb was despondent due to the role that the T-7 ion rifles had played in the destruction of his homeworld Lasan. Kanan's plan to sell the rifles to Vizagoto did little to mollify the Lasat, who retreated to his cabin and locked the door. While Ezra was initially angry at Zeb for locking out of his shared room, he came to understand the Lasat's despondency when Hera told him about the role that these weapons had played in the destruction of Lasan. Unknown to Zeb, his actions on Garel had attracted the attention of an old adversary: Agent Kallus, the Imperial officer who had ordered the deployment of T-7 rifles on Lasan. The crew of the ''Ghost'' traveled to Lothal with the intention of selling the T-7 rifles to Vizagoto. Not knowing that the Spectres were friends of his master, C-3PO inadvertently revealed their location to Agent Kallus, who assembled a force to apprehend the rebel band.<ref name="Droids in Distress" />

Before Zeb and his companions could complete their transaction with Vizagoto, Agent Kallus arrived with a platoon of stormtroopers and two [[All Terrain Defense Pod|AT-DP]] walkers. During the ensuing battle, Zeb was challenged by Agent Kallus, who unveiled a stolen bo-rifle. Zeb was enraged as the hallowed weapon was a badge of honor for members of the Lasan Honor Guard, who were also the only ones permitted to carry them, and viciously attacked the Imperial. Kallus revealed that not only had he personally murdered the [[Unidentified Lasat Honor Guard|Honor Guardsman]] whose bo-rifle he held, he had also taken part in the genocide of the Lasat species and given the order for the disruptors to be used, if possible making Zeb even more furious. Utilizing his emotion-laden attacks, Kallus soon gained the upper hand over the Lasat. Before Kallus could finish him off, Zeb was saved by Ezra who used the Force to push Kallus away from him. As a result of Ezra's actions, Zeb developed a better rapport with the young human. During the fighting, the rebels managed to destroy the T-7 disruptors and escape their Imperial pursuers. Following their escape, the crew of the ''Ghost'' rendezvoused with Senator Bail Organa and returned C-3PO and R2-D2 to their rightful owner. In return for destroying the T-7 disruptors, Senator Organa paid Spectres several credits to help them cover their living expenses.<ref name="Droids in Distress" />

====The Meiloorun Hunt====
[[File:Fighter Flight Thumb.png|thumb|220px|Zeb and Ezra flying a stolen TIE fighter.]]
Following the T-7 disruptors incident, Ezra and Zeb got into a fight. Hera punished them by sending them into town to pick up supplies and told them not to come back without at least one [[Meiloorun fruit]]. They found some but they had already been sold to the Empire. After failing to acquire them with the [[Force-attunement|Force]], Ezra tried to steal them up only to be spotted by troopers. While fleeing, the two rebels were separated and Zeb found himself cornered by two stormtrooper and a TIE fighter piloted by Baron Valen Rudor, whom he had encountered earlier. During a brief skirmish, Zeb leaped into the TIE fighter and tossed the pilot out, taking it for his own. He saw Ezra running from troopers on the rooftops and allowed him to board the starfighter in return for Ezra saving him from Agent Kallus earlier. Zeb and Ezra then flew the TIE fighter into the surrounding countryside.<ref name="Fighter Flight">{{Rebels|Fighter Flight}}</ref>

Once onboard the vessel, the two contacted Syndulla and Jarrus, who ordered them to destroy the small ship and proceed to the rebel rendezvous point. Before doing so, Bridger asked Orrelios to check on [[Morad Sumar]]'s freshly-destroyed farm and to help him free the prisoners. After a [[Attack on Imperial Troop Transports|small confrontation]], the pair managed to save Sumar and two other prisoners from [[Yogar Lyste]], and retrieve a meiloorum fruit. Afterwards, they hid the stolen TIE fighter,<ref name="Fire Across the Galaxy">{{Rebels|Fire Across the Galaxy}}</ref> but claimed to have destroyed to Jarrus and Syndulla's approval. Back onboard the ''Ghost'', Wren shows them her new work of art, depicting Chopper's prank.<ref name="Fighter Flight" />

====Mission to Stygeon Prime====
{{Quote|Maintain comm silence. And whatever you do, hold this lift.|Kanan's instructions to Zeb and Sabine|Rise of the Old Masters}}
[[File:Rise of the Old Masters thumb.png|thumb|left|250px|Zeb and his rebel companions planning their mission to rescue Luminara Unduli.]]
Later, Zeb and Chopper were present during one of Ezra Bridger's Jedi training lessons on the hull of the ''Ghost'' high above Lothal's atmosphere. Both were assigned the job of hurling [[blue milk]] cartons and rocks for Ezra to deflect with Jarrus Kanan's lightsaber. Distracted, Ezra was unable to pay attention to Kanan's lesson and fell from the ''Ghost''. Ezra was rescued by Kanan who used the Force to hold him place in mid-air while Zeb fastened a hook and pulled him back into the ship. Following Ezra's lesson, Zeb and the other ''Ghost'' crew heard a broadcast by the dissident Senator [[Gall Trayvis]] that the [[Jedi Master]] [[Luminara Unduli]] was imprisoned in the [[Stygeon system]]. Unknown to the rebel band, Trayvis was working for the Empire and had planted the information to lure the rebels into a trap.<ref name="Rise of the Old Masters">{{Rebels|Rise of the Old Masters}}</ref>

While Chopper and Hera waited aboard the ''Ghost'' and its auxiliary vessel the ''Phantom'', Zeb, Sabine, Ezra, and Kanan infiltrated the [[Spire (Stygeon Prime)|Spire]], the Imperial prison where Luminara was reputed to be held. Part of the infiltration plan involved Ezra riding piggyback on Zeb as they leapt onto the sentry's platform in order to avoid arousing the Imperial stormtrooper sentries. Seeking to prove his abilities, Ezra disobeyed Kanan's orders and jumped onto the platform and collided with the heavy blast door in the process. This aroused the Imperial sentries and the rebels were forced to fight them. During this skirmish, the Lasat warrior knocked two stormtroopers unconscious by smashing their heads together. Kanan eliminated the other two troopers by using the Force to hurtle them into the door.<ref name="Rise of the Old Masters" />

After incapacitating the sentries, Zeb and the other three rebels headed down a [[turbolift]] to Luminara's isolation cell, which was situated at the bottom of the prison complex. On the way, they encountered two more stormtrooper sentries whom Zeb quickly knocked unconscious and dragged into the turbolift. While Zeb and Sabine guarded the lift, Kanan and Ezra entered the detention block complex to look for Master Luminara. They managed to find Luminara's cell only to discover that she was already dead and were subsequently attacked by [[the Grand Inquisitor]], a [[Force-sensitive]] agent of the Empire tasked with hunting and destroying Jedi. While the Jedi were gone, Sabine discovered that they had stumbled into a trap. To delay Imperial reinforcements, Zeb and Sabine jammed the turbolifts.<ref name="Rise of the Old Masters" />

After a brief duel, Ezra and Kanan managed to reunite with Zeb and Sabine. Together, the four rebels made their way to their new escape point: the Spire's landing platform. During their escape, Zeb and his rebel companions were forced to dodge closing blast doors and the pursuing Inquisitor, who was armed with a double-bladed lightsaber. Zeb himself narrowly escaped death at the hands of the Inquisitor's lightsaber blade. The rebels then fled into an empty hangar bay and Zeb managed to delay the Inquisitor by jamming the hangar bay's blast doors. Before the Inquisitor could catch up with them by hacking through the blast door, Ezra and Kanan managed to use the Force to open the hangar bay's outer doors. However, the rebels were then trapped between the Inquisitor and several stormtroopers and TIE fighter pilots who were waiting outside the hangar bay.<ref name="Rise of the Old Masters" />

During the ensuing skirmish, Zeb threw a [[thermal detonator]] at the Imperial troops which enabled Hera to land in the ''Phantom'' and extract them. The rebels' escape from The Spire was also aided by the arrival of a large swarm of [[tibidee]]s, broad-winged creatures that resembled kites. Hera had been able to win over these winged creatures by using the Phantom's signal jammer to mimic their mating call. These tibidees made it hard for the Imperial cannons to target the ''Phantom''. During their flight, Zeb also fired on an Imperial gun turret. The Inquisitor also attempted to stop the rebels by hurling his lightsaber at them but Kanan deflected its blow. After the Inquisitor retrieved his weapon, Zeb asked Kanan whether his lightsaber could spin in the same way as the Inquisitor's one. Zeb and his rebel companions managed to return to the ''Ghost'' and escape into space. Despite their failure to rescue Luminara, Zeb conceded that the rebels had made sure that no other Jedi fell into the Inquisitor's trap.<ref name="Rise of the Old Masters" />

====Assaulting the Lothal Imperial Academy====
[[File:Imperial Academy Lothal.png|thumb|200px|Zeb took part in a mission to extract Ezra from the Imperial Academy.]]
Later, Ezra Bridger infiltrated Lothal's [[Academy for Young Imperials]] in order to steal a decoder containing the location of a powerful [[kyber crystal]]. During the mission, Zeb along with Sabine and Chopper kept a watch over him. While Chopper infiltrated the Academy disguised as an Imperial astromech droid, Zeb and Sabine waited outside the Academy to evacuate Ezra once he had accomplished his mission. With the assistance of fellow [[Cadet]] [[Zare Leonis]], Ezra succeeded in stealing the decoder from Agent Kallus' office. This intelligence enabled Hera and Kanan to intercept and destroy an Imperial convoy transporting the crystal.<ref name="Breaking Ranks">{{Rebels|Breaking Ranks}}</ref> After the rebels had finished using the decoder, they made arrangements to pass it onto Leonis' girlfriend [[Merei Spanjaf]], who needed the decoder to hack into the Imperial data network to find Zare's sister [[Dhara Leonis]].<ref name="Rebel in the Ranks">''[[Servants of the Empire: Rebel in the Ranks]]''</ref>

However, their plans to evacuate Ezra were delayed when Ezra and Zare discovered that another cadet [[Jai Kell]] had shown an affinity for the Force and attracted the attention of the [[Inquisitorius|Inquisitor]]. After convincing Jai to escape with them, Ezra convinced Zeb and the other rebels to stage a diversionary attack on the Academy the following day. As planned, Zeb along with Sabine and Chopper attacked the academy, allowing Ezra and Kell to escape using an AT-DP.<ref name="Breaking Ranks" /> However, Zare opted to stay behind in order to discover the whereabouts of his sister Dhara, whom he later learnt had been abducted by the Inquisitor for a secret Imperial project called [[Project Harvest]].<ref name="Rebel in the Ranks" />

====Exploits at Fort Anaxes====
While the ''Ghost'' was traveling in space, Zeb got involved in a little spat with Ezra and Chopper. This argument distracted the three of them from the task of running a diagnostic scan on the ''Ghost''{{'s}} auxiliary vessel, the ''Phantom''. Thus, they did not detect a fuel leak on the ''Ghost''{{'s}} engine. This mishap stranded Hera Syndulla and Sabine Wren on [[Fort Anaxes]], a remote asteroid base once used by the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] during the [[Clone Wars]]. During their trip to Fort Anaxes, Hera and Sabine were attacked by [[Fyrnock]]s, a species of silicon-based predators. After much difficulty, Hera and Sabine managed to escape the Fyrnocks with the help of the rest of the ''Ghost''{{'s}} crew.<ref name="Out of Darkness">{{Rebels|Out of Darkness}}</ref>

====Empire Day====
[[File:Zeb fires at Kallus.png|thumb|left|250px|Zeb escaping Agent Kallus' clutches again.]]
On Empire Day, Zeb and his rebel companions visited a [[cantina]] in Lothal's Capital City. Around that time, the [[Rodian]] [[Tseebo]], who worked for the [[Imperial Information Office]] had gone missing and the Imperial authorities had launched a manhunt. Zeb was present at the cantina when three TIE fighter pilots visited the building and briefly accosted a Rodian customer, whom they later released after determining that he was not Tseebo. During the Empire Day celebrations that night, the ''Ghost''{{'s}} crew decided to destroy a new [[TIE Advanced v1]] prototype that was displayed to the Lothalian public. While Kanan planted a thermal detonator on the TIE's [[repulsorlift]] platform, Zeb and Sabine distracted the Imperials by lighting colorful fireworks.<ref name="EDWD">''[[Ezra's Duel with Danger]]''</ref>

After destroying the TIE Advanced fighter, Zeb hid in Capital City's old market while his rebel companions hid in Ezra's former family home. Due to his physique, Zeb was unable to fit into Ezra's former home. While hiding in Zeb's former home, his companions discovered the hidden Tseebo, who had known Ezra's parents and had decided to defect from the Empire. He was wearing a cybernetic headset which contained valuable intelligence on Imperial military products and the Empire's five-year plan for Lothal. Later, Zeb linked up with Hera and Chopper and they took off in the ''Ghost''. They then rendezvoused with Kanan and the other rebels who had escaped with Tseebo in a hijacked [[Imperial Troop Transport]]. The rebels were pursued by another troop transport piloted by Agent Kallus, who was determining to recover Tseebo and to capture the rebels.<ref name="EDWD" />

During a brief ground skirmish, Zeb fired his bo-rifle at Agent Kallus, causing him to lose his balance and fall of his transport. Having successfully extracted their comrades and Tseebo, the ''Ghost'' fled into space. The ''Ghost'' was pursued by a force of TIE fighters led by the Inquisitor, who was piloting his own TIE Advanced fighter. During this pursuit, Chopper was hit by laser fire and Zeb was forced to take his place at the rear gun turret. After a lengthy pursuit, the ''Ghost'' managed to flee into hyperspace. However, the Inquisitor succeeded in implanting an [[XX-23 S-thread tracker]] on the ''Ghost''{{'s}} auxiliary vessel, the ''Phantom''. Later, Zeb remained aboard the ''Ghost'' with the other crew and Tseebo while Kanan and Ezra departed on the ''Phantom'' for the asteroid base [[PM-1203]] in order to lure the Inquisitor away from the ''Ghost''. Zeb was present when Tseebo was picked up by an [[Alderaan]]ian [[CR90 corvette|blockade runner]] that whisked him away into hiding. After Ezra completed his [[Jedi Trials|Jedi trials]], Zeb and the other crew were present when the young Jedi apprentice presented his new lightsaber.<ref name="EDWD" />

====Saving Mindiz====
One day, Orrelios and the Spectres went to Tarkintown to distribute crates of fruits. The Lasat was glad to see his friend Mindiz again, but after the girl took a bite of Jogan fruit, she suddenly collapsed. When it turned out that the crates had been poisoned, Orrelios decided to raid the medical facility of the Imperial Complex on his own. However, it all turned out to be a trap set by Agent Kallus, and the Lasat found himself at the mercy of his archenemy. Fortunately, the other Spectres both came to his rescue in the nick of time and obtained an antidote for the Tarkintown settlers.<ref name="Sabotaged" />

====Enter Lando Calrissian====
[[File:Wren and Zeb fight Azmorigan.png|thumb|250px|Zeb and Wren fighting the crime lord Azmorigan.]]
Later, Zeb along with Kanan and Chopper visited [[Old Jho's Pit Stop]] on Lothal where they met the "galactic entrepreneur" [[Lando Calrissian]]. Short on funds, Zeb decided to bet on Chopper during a game of [[sabacc]] with Calrissian, which the latter won. As a result, Calrissian gained ownership of Chopper. Zeb's foolhardy action angered Hera, who regarded Chopper as a member of her crew. Lando then forced the crew of the ''Ghost'' to assist him in a dangerous smuggling run in order to get Chopper back. This run involved trading Hera to the crime lord [[Azmorigan]] in exchange for a [[puffer pig]], which Calrissian intended to use to find valuable minerals. To avoid competition from private entrepreneurs like Calrissian, the Empire had restricted the sale of puffer pigs. After overpowering Azmorigan, Hera escaped the crime lord's vessel in an [[escape pod]] and the Spectres returned to Lothal where Calrissian owned a plot of land.<ref name="Idiot's Array">{{Rebels|Idiot's Array (episode)|Idiot's Array}}</ref>

During the journey, Zeb and Ezra created some trouble aboard the ''Ghost'' by accidentally releasing the puffer pig, which wrecked havoc on the starship. After escaping several TIE fighters, the ''Ghost'' managed to land at Calrissian's estate with his prized cargo. However, Azmorigan and his henchmen had already arrived at the homestead with the intention of exacting revenge against Calrissian and his associates. A blaster battle broke out between the Spectres and Azmorigan's henchmen. During the fighting, Azmorigan briefly took Zeb hostage and attempted to force the rebels to hand over Calrissian. However, Chopper rescued Zeb by firing the ''Ghost''{{'s}} cannon on Azmorigan, spooking the gangster. The Spectres then forced Azmorigan and his henchmen to flee empty-handed. Following their adventure with Calrissian, Chopper stole several of Calrissian's fuel canisters, which the smuggler conceded as payment to the Spectres for their help.<ref name="Idiot's Array" />

====The false rebel====
[[File:Rebels at Lothal Senate Building.png|thumb|left|250px|Zeb (far right) and his companions stalking the Lothal City Capitol Building.]]
Later, Zeb along with Sabine and Chopper took part in one of Ezra's Jedi training sessions. Kanan was teaching Ezra the technique known as [[Form V]] which involved Ezra using his lightsaber to deflect blaster stun shots from Zeb, Sabine, and Chopper towards an assigned target: a stormtrooper helmet set on a rock. During the training exercise, Ezra experienced a [[Force vision|vision]] of them fighting alongside the outspoken dissident Senator-in-exile Gall Trayvis, whose transmissions had helped boost the Spectres' morale. Following the training session, the crew of the ''Ghost'' intercepted a transmission from the Senator praising the Spectres and telling them to meet at the [[Lothal City Capitol Building]] on Lothal. Unknown to the Spectres, this meeting was an operation set by Agent Kallus to trap them and Senator Travyis was actually working for the Empire.<ref name="Vision of Hope">{{Rebels|Vision of Hope}}</ref>

Suspecting something afoot, Zeb and his rebel companions decided to contact Merei Spanjaf, the girlfriend of Ezra's cadet friend Zare Leonis. Posing as Spectre-4, Zeb contacted Merei by [[comlink]] and asked her to help them get in touch with Leonis. Merei warned Zeb that they could not contact Leonis electronically since the Empire had started monitoring all Imperial Academy communications. Facing her own predicament, she angrily warned Zeb to leave Zare alone since they were endangering him. In response, Zeb retorted that he and his compatriots faced danger everyday of their lives. Merei then suggested that Zeb send Chopper to get in touch with Leonis. The crew of the ''Ghost'' then disguised Chopper as an Imperial astromech droid and sent him to contact Leonis at the Imperial Academy. Due to Chopper's efforts, Leonis was able to meet Ezra in the market place and inform him that the Empire was mounting a massive security operation at the Lothal City Capitol Building that night.<ref name="Imperial Justice">''[[Servants of the Empire: Imperial Justice]]''</ref>

In response to this new development, the Spectres decided to sneak into the building through the sewers in order to warn Senator Trayvis. While Chopper guarded the manhole, Zeb and the other rebels entered the sewers. After entering the Senate Building, the rebel band split up, with Zeb and Sabine going one way, and Ezra, Kanan, and Hera going the other way. Ezra, Kanan, and Hera managed to meet Senator Trayvis but were quickly surrounded by Agent Kallus and several stormtroopers. However, Zeb and and Sabine dropped smoke grenades which enabled the rebels to escape with Senator Trayvis. To evade their Imperial pursuers, they fled down the sewers and split into two groups. Zeb traveled with Sabine and Kanan while Ezra and Hera accompanied the fugitive senator. Senator Trayvis then revealed his true loyalties and attempted to kill Ezra and Hera. However, he was quickly overpowered by Hera. Zeb and his rebel comrades then managed to exit the sewers after Kanan used the Force to temporarily stop a large circular fan. After reuniting with Chopper at the manhole, they fled back to the ''Ghost''. <ref name="Vision of Hope" />

====Rescuing Kanan====
[[File:Lothal rebels TIE.png|thumb|220px|Zeb and Ezra's stolen TIE fighter: the "Sabine's masterpiece".]]
The Spectres' activities on Lothal eventually attracted the attention of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, who decided to implement a final solution to the rebel problem there. Following their encounter with Senator Trayvis, Zeb participated in Kanan's plan to take control of the Empire's main communications tower on Lothal. The rebels wanted to transmit a broadcast in order to counter Imperial propaganda depicting them in a negative light. As part of the plan, Sabine and Zeb drove their speeder bikes past the stormtroopers and took control of the anti-aircraft guns there. While Sabine distracted the Imperial stormtroopers there by ramming her speeder bike into a gun turret, Zeb hijacked another gun turret and destroyed the third remaining gun turret. Sabine and Zeb's actions enabled Kanan, Ezra, and Chopper to enter the communications tower. Chopper then proceeded to upload a data spike into the tower's central computer which would allow Kanan to broadcast his message to the galaxy. Unknown to the Spectres, Tarkin and Agent Kallus had planned to trap them in the communications tower.<ref name="Battle to the End">''[[Battle to the End]]''</ref>

Before Kanan could begin his broadcast, Agent Kallus and the Inquisitor entered the tower complex with a force of three [[LAAT/le gunship|patrol transports]] and two [[Imperial troop transport]]s. Zeb managed to shoot down one of the gunships but was unable to stop the Imperial counter-attack. While Kanan held back the Imperials, Zeb and the other rebels fled up the turbolift to the tower's summit to await their getaway transport, the ''Phantom'', which was being piloted by Hera. The rebels were cornered by one of the patrol transports but Sabine destroyed it with a grenade. Zeb and other rebels then escaped aboard the ''Phantom'' and fled into space. However, they were unable to rescue Kanan who was captured by the Imperials. Despite Kanan's capture, Ezra still managed to broadcast a message to Lothal and the surrounding systems before the tower was destroyed by Tarkin, who then blamed the rebels for destroying the tower.<ref name="Battle to the End" />

Zeb and the other rebels were greatly distressed by Kanan's capture and were unhappy with [[Ahsoka Tano|Fulcrum]] and Hera's orders that they sacrifice Kanan to avoid exposing the other rebel cells to the Imperial authorities. In their desperation, they hijacked an AT-DP walker in an attempt to access the Imperial network and find Kanan. However, their mission proved futile since the destruction of the communications tower had destroyed the Imperial communications network.<ref name="Rebel Resolve">{{Rebels|Rebel Resolve}}</ref> Later, Zeb along with Sabine and Chopper assisted Ezra's second plan to rescue Kanan. Their plan involved "borrowing" the ''Phantom'', the ''Ghost''{{'s}} auxiliary vessel, and visiting the Devaronian crime lord Vizago with the hope of finding a lead on Kanan's whereabouts. While Vizago could not provide them with any information about Kanan, he revealed that the Imperials were using [[Imperial communication droid|courier droids]] to transport secure information due to the communication tower's destruction.<ref name="Battle to the End" />

With Hera's approval, Ezra concocted a plan that involved disguising Chopper as an Imperial courier droid and using him to infiltrate an Imperial computer. Zeb contributed to this plan by ambushing a squad of stormtroopers and kidnapping the courier droid [[264]]. After Chopper had finished downloading files from an [[Arquitens-class light cruiser|Imperial communications ship]] above Lothal, Zeb and the other rebel crew rescued him by launching a feint attack on the Imperial starship and extracting Chopper. Due to this mission, the rebels discovered that Kanan was aboard Grand Moff Tarkin's Star Destroyer, the ''[[Sovereign]]'', but that the vessel was scheduled to depart for the [[Mustafar system]] soon. Later, Zeb and his comrades stole an Imperial ''Gozanti''-class cruiser and used it to travel to the Mustafar system. They hid the ''Ghost'' on Lothal to avoid attracting the attention of the Imperials since the freighter had become familiar to Imperial authorities.<ref name="Battle to the End" />

After Ezra sensed that Kanan was on Tarkin's Star Destroyer ''Sovereign'', the Spectres pretended to transit several TIE fighters to the Star Destroyers. After Sabine had used their stolen TIE fighter to disable the ship's technological systems, Zeb and his rebel comrades boarded the ''Sovereign'' and fought several stormtrooper reinforcements. Their distraction enabled Ezra to free Kanan and together the two defeated the Inquisitor. During their [[Action at Mustafar|duel]], the Inquisitor's lightsaber fell into the ship's hyperdrive energy conduit, which created an explosion that destroyed the Star Destroyer. Zeb and his rebel comrades managed to escape the derelict vessel but were pursued by a swarm of Imperial TIE fighters. However, Zeb and his comrades were rescued by Chopper and the mysterious rebel leader Fulcrum, who marshaled a small force of rebel starships including the ''Ghost'' to destroy the TIE fighters. Later, Zeb and his companions discovered that Fulcrum was the pseudonym for the Jedi Clone Wars veteran Ahsoka Tano, who had become a key resistance leader in the growing rebellion.<ref name="Battle to the End" />

===The rebellion===
====Mission to Arkanis====
[[File:RescueofDharaLeonis.png|thumb|left|220px|Zeb and his fellow Spectres storming Area Null.]]
Following Kanan's rescue, Zeb was contacted by the Ithorian tavern keeper [[Jho|Old Jho]], who wanted to deliver a number of fugitives including the poet and painter [[Holshef]], the hacker Merei Spanjaf, her parents [[Gandr Spanjaf|Gandri]] and [[Jessa Spanjaf|Jessa]], and the [[Leonis family|Leonises]] for the rebels to hide. Since Zeb and his companions were unable to travel to Lothal, he arranged for Jho to deliver the fugitives in his [[Jho's freight hauler|freight hauler]] to the edge of the [[Garel system]]. From there, Zeb and the other crew of the ''Ghost'' picked up Merei and her companions before transporting them into hiding on the planet Garel.<ref name="Secret Academy">''[[Servants of the Empire: The Secret Academy]]''</ref>

After spiriting Merei and her companions into hiding, Zeb along with Ezra Bridger and Sabine Wren took part in a mission to rescue Zare Leonis, an old acquaintance who had helped the Spectres during an earlier mission to steal a [[decoder]] from Agent Kallus. While on a mission to find his missing sister Dhara Leonis, Zare had been transferred to the planet [[Arkanis]], which hosted a secret facility called [[Area Null]] that hosted several secret Imperial programs including [[Project Harvester]]. While training as a [[Imperial cadet|cadet]] at the [[Arkanis Academy]], Zare was exposed as a traitor and scheduled for execution. Merei had learned about Zare's predicament by using a fake [[Imperial Security Bureau|ISB]] account to penetrate the Imperial data network on Lothal. She subsequently convinced Zeb and his companions to help rescue Zare.<ref name="Secret Academy" />

Together with Merei and Jessa, Zeb and his companions traveled on the ''Ghost'' to Area Null. Since they had not obtained Hera Syndulla's permission for borrowing the ship, the rebels agreed that they had to complete their mission quickly. After landing on the roof, they made their way downstairs where they encountered Zare and another prisoner named [[Beck Ollet]], who had already managed to free themselves. While Merei, Zare, and Beck went to free Dhara, Zeb and Sabine went to the main computer node to lock Imperial reinforcements out of the tower and the elevators. Meanwhile, Ezra guarded the roof so that the rebels could escape. Despite resistance from the local Imperial garrison, the rebels succeeded with their [[Rescue of Dhara Leonis|mission]] to rescue Zare and Dhara. They managed to return on the ''Ghost'' to Garel before Imperial TIE fighters could be scrambled.<ref name="Secret Academy" />

====Escaping the Siege of Lothal====
[[File:Maketh Tua contacts the rebels.png|thumb|right|220px|Zeb and his comrades took part in an ill-fated mission to rescue Maketh Tua.]]
Following Kanan's rescue in the Mustafar system, Zeb and his fellow rebels learnt that they were part of a larger rebellion against the Galactic Empire. The Spectres also joined the [[Phoenix Cell]] and took part in a mission to steal [[Deflector shield generator|shield generators]] from an Imperial convoy. In response to the increased rebel activity on Lothal, [[Darth Sidious]] dispatched his [[Sith apprentice|apprentice]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] to deal with them. Later, Zeb took part in a [[Mission to Lothal (4 BBY)|mission]] on Lothal to extract the defecting Imperial Minister Maketh Tua, who had become disillusioned with the Empire. While the other rebels went to meet Tua, Zeb and Chopper guarded the rebels' get-away transport, a Star Commuter 2000 shuttle. However, Agent Kallus had already learnt about Tua's defection and arranged for her death in a [[Sentinel-class landing craft|shuttle explosion]] which he blamed on the Spectres. The rebels fled but their shuttle was shot down by Imperial forces.<ref name="The Siege of Lothal" />

After escaping an Imperial attack on their safehouse, Ezra's former home, Zeb and his companions infiltrated the Imperial Headquarters in Lothal's Capital City. While Kanan and Ezra impersonated a stormtrooper and Imperial cadet, Zeb and the other crew hid in the crates that the former were delivering. The Spectres then encountered Darth Vader at the Imperial headquarters' starport. Following a fierce confrontation, the rebels managed to escape Lothal with the help of their old friend Lando Calrissian. Following the events on Lothal, the rebels reached a consensus that they could not return to the planet in order to avoid endangering its inhabitants. Unknown to the Spectres, Darth Vader had placed a [[Homing beacon|tracking device]] on their shuttle with the intention of "killing two birds with one stone" by eliminating both the Spectres and the Phoenix rebel fleet. Zeb and his rebel comrades escaped Darth Vader's [[Attack on Phoenix Squadron (4 BBY)|assault]] on the Phoenix Fleet. However, the Phoenix rebels lost their flagship ''[[Phoenix Home]]'', which was heavily damaged by Vader's [[TIE Advanced x1]] starfighter.<ref name="The Siege of Lothal" />

====Meeting the Lost Commanders====
[[File:Zeb as Bait.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Zeb serving as joopa "bait".]]
Following the near-destruction of the Phoenix rebel fleet, the rebel network faced a shortage of bases and facilities. Ahsoka Tano sent Zeb and his companions to meet with an old friend on the desert world of [[Seelos]], who might know where to find such bases. Upon arriving in the [[Seelos system]], the ''Ghost'' was damaged. While Hera and Chopper stayed behind to repair the ship, Rex and the other rebels descended into the planet in the ''Phantom''. There, they discovered that this friend was the former [[Clone Captain]] [[Rex]], who lived in an antiquated [[All Terrain Tactical Enforcer|AT-TE walker]] with fellow Clone veterans [[CC-3636|Wolffe]] and [[CC-5576-39|Gregor]].<ref name="The Lost Commanders">{{Rebels|The Lost Commanders}}</ref>

After a brief misunderstand, Ezra managed to defuse the conflict by convincing Rex that Ahsoka had sent them. Rex then welcomed Zeb and his companions as allies and introduced his comrades Wolffe and Gregor. Following some discussions, the clones agreed to supply the rebels with a list of abandoned bases in exchange for them participating in a hunt for [[joopa]]s, large worm-like creatures which lived beneath the sands of Seelos. Zeb agreed to hunt for the joopa while his fellow rebels and the clones watched from the AT-TE walker in tow. When Ezra learnt that Zeb was to also serve as the "bait", he tried to warn the Lasat. However, Zeb was quickly grabbed by the joopa. The rebels and clones worked together to save Zeb and to kill the joopa.<ref name="The Lost Commanders" />

Having honored their side of the bargain, Kanan wanted to leave but Rex convinced the rebels to stay for dinner. While visiting the communications room, Sabine learnt that Wolffe had secretly alerted the Empire to their presence and hidden Ahsoka's messages. When confronted by Rex, Wolffe admitted to his wrongdoing and argued that he had been trying to protect his friends from being punished by the Empire for harboring fugitives. Shortly later, an Imperial [[probe droid]] attacked the ''Phantom'' and damaged the ship before it was destroyed by Rex.<ref name="The Lost Commanders" />

While Zeb and his companions made preparations to leave on the ''Phantom'', the three clones opted to stay behind to hold back the Imperials. A sandstorm coincided with the arrival of an Imperial force consisting of three [[All Terrain Armored Transport|AT-AT walkers]] led by Agent Kallus, a perennial foe of Zeb and the rebels. Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, the clones rode to battle against Kallus' walkers in their antiquated AT-TE walker. At the urging of Ezra, the rebels returned to assist the clones. Zeb along with Kanan and Ezra hijacked an AT-AT walker and used it to destroy Kallus' walker. After the Imperials had retreated, the clones agreed to join the rebellion.<ref name="Relics of the Old Republic">{{Rebels|Relics of the Old Republic}}</ref>

===="Commander Meiloorun"====
[[File:Commander Meiloorun.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Zeb aboard the upside-down ''Phantom'', ready to ambush the Inquisitors.]]
Following the events on Seelos, the Rebel network gained access to Rex's list of abandoned Republic bases and installations. Hera sent Zeb along with Sabine, Chopper, and Ezra on a mission to salvage some medical supplies from an Old Republic medical space station. They traveled to the abandoned medical base in the ''Phantom''. Upon arriving there, Chopper powered up the space station so that the rebels could locate the supplies. Unknown to the rebels, another Inquisitor known as the [[Seventh Sister]] was waiting for them. The Seventh Sister used her [[ID9 seeker droid]]s to monitor them and to incapacitate Chopper.<ref name="Always Two There Are">{{Rebels|Always Two There Are}}</ref>

While exploring the medical station, Zeb and his companions hear Chopper's distress call. Ezra and Sabine climbed up a ventilation shaft. Zeb tried to follow by the bulky Lasat got stuck. Meanwhile, Ezra and Sabine were attacked by the Seventh Sister and her seeker droids. Sabine managed to escape but Ezra was captured by the Seventh Sister and another Inquisitor, the [[Fifth Brother]]. Wren found her back to the ventilation shaft and managed to free Zeb. Sabine then told him about their encounter with the two Inquisitors. Zeb suggested alerting Kanan but Sabine argued against that idea since that would allow the Imperials to trace their signals and locate the fleet. In the end, Zeb and Sabine decided to rescue Ezra and Chopper.<ref name="Always Two There Are" />

Using his Force powers, the Fifth Brother then hunted down Sabine and Zeb. Despite the two rebels planting thermal detonators, Sabine was unable to trigger them. The Fifth Brother then used the Force to throw the detonators at the two rebels. Both survived the explosion but Sabine was captured by the Fifth Brother. Zeb managed to destroy the Fifth Brother's seeker droids and find the medical supplies they had been looking for. The Lasat also found a damaged Chopper and carried back to the ''Phantom'' with the medical supplies. Committed to rescuing Ezra and Sabine, Zeb initially thought about taking on the two Inquisitors with his bo-rifle but came up with a different idea.<ref name="Always Two There Are" />

Using the ''Phantom''{{'s}} intercom, Zeb posed as "Commander Meiloorun" and radioed Sabine and Wren, offering them support. The Inquisitors took the bait and marched to the hangar bay with their captives to confront "Commander Meiloorun." However, Zeb had re-positioned the ''Phantom'' hanging upside on the ceiling. When a seeker droid spotted him, Zeb created a commotion that enabled Ezra and Sabine to break free of their captors and board the ''Phantom''. Despite the Inquisitors' efforts to use their Force powers to capture the ship, the ''Phantom'' escaped into space with the entire team and most of the medical supplies. Upon returning to the Phoenix fleet, Zeb and his companions alerted the other rebels to the existence of more Inquisitors.<ref name="Always Two There Are" />

====Mission to Shantipole====
[[File:Jun Sato and Quarrie.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|Zeb and his rebel comrades with Quarrie and Commander Sato.]]
Following a failed attempt by the Phoenix fleet to break the Imperial [[Blockade of Ibaar|blockade]] around Ibaar, Zeb and the other crew of the ''Ghost'' took part in a mission to contact a [[Mon Calamari]] engineer named [[Quarrie]], who lived on the planet [[Shantipole]]. Quarrie had developed a prototype heavy assault fighter known as the [[Prototype B6|Blade Wing]], the precursor to the [[A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter|B-wing starfighter]]. Shantipole was a planet with a volatile atmosphere that made it hazardous for many space travelers. At the insistence of Kanan, Hera agreed to lead the mission. Zeb accompanied Hera and Sabine down to Shantipole in the ''Phantom'' while Kanan, Ezra, and Chopper took the ''Ghost'' to collect more relief supplies for the Phoenix fleet's second attempt to break the Imperial blockade.<ref name="Wings of the Master">{{Rebels|Wings of the Master}}</ref>

While flying through the canyons, Zeb spotted Quarrie's landing field. Despite being struck by lightning, Hera managed to land the damaged ''Ghost'' with some assistance from Quarrie. With Quarrie's permission, Hera flew the Blade Wing starfighter during a test flight and assessed that its combat capabilities would help the rebels break the blockade around Ibaar. Zeb and his companions then traveled to Ibaar on the newly repaired and modified ''Phantom'' with the Blade Wing starfighter in tow. During the second blockade run, Zeb and Sabine manned the helm of the ''Phantom'' while Hera used the Blade Wing to destroy an ''Arquitens''-class light cruise. This enabled the ''Ghost'', which was carrying the second shipment of supplies, to break through the blockade and deliver relief supplies to the people of Ibaar.<ref name="Wings of the Master" />

====The Imperial Interdictor====
Later, Zeb and his fellow ''Ghost'' crew members received a distress transmission from [[Commander]] [[Jun Sato]], whose CR90 corvette ''[[Liberator (CR90 corvette)|Liberator]]'' had been pulled out of hyperspace and captured by an [[Imperial Interdictor]], a new prototype warship equipped with [[gravity well projector]]s. When Kanan called for the crew of the ''Ghost'' to suit up and prepare for a rescue mission, Phoenix Leader Hera devised an alternate rescue plan which involved Kanan, Chopper, and the former Clone Captain Rex infiltrating the Imperial Interdictor and rescuing Sato, Ezra, and the other crew. Zeb contributed to this rescue plan by capturing two stormtroopers. After donning their armor, the three rebels traveled to the Imperial Interdictor in a stolen ''Sentinel''-class landing craft. Kanan, Rex, and Chopper not only succeeded in rescuing the other rebels with Ezra's help but also managed to destroy the Interdictor and two Imperial light cruisers.<ref name="Stealth Strike">{{Rebels|Stealth Strike}}</ref>

====Mission to Takobo====
Zeb, Kanan, Chopper, and Ezra later assisted their Jedi ally Ahsoka Tano in a mission to investigate the activities of the Inquisitors. Tano had discovered that the Inquisitors had a secondary mission: kidnapping Force-sensitive infants. Ahsoka had also managed to decode two coordinates. While she explored the first set of coordinates, Zeb and the crew of the ''Ghost'' explored the second set, which led them to [[Hammertown]], a settlement on the planet [[Takobo]]. After learning that the coordinates were houses, Kanan ordered Zeb and Chopper to stay behind and check the spaceport for Inquisitors. Meanwhile, he and Ezra went to investigate the location of the coordinates.<ref name="Future of the Force">{{Rebels|The Future of the Force}}</ref>

After searching the spaceport for several hours, Zeb and Chopper stumbled upon two TIE Advanced v1 starfighters that was being guarded by an ID9 seeker droid, which they had encountered during an earlier adventure on the abandoned Republic medical station. Zeb destroyed the seeker droid with his bo-rifle. While probing the starfighters, Zeb discovered a human infant named [[Alora (child)|Alora]], whom the Inquisitors had abducted during an earlier expedition to the planet [[Chandel]]. After freeing the child, Zeb and Chopper destroyed the two TIEs with explosives.<ref name="Future of the Force" />

[[File:Surrounded by Inquisitors.png|thumb|right|250px|Orrelios, Jarrus, Bridger and Pypey being attacked by the Fifth Brother and Seventh Sister.]]
Meanwhile, Kanan and Ezra discovered that the Inquisitors had attempted to kidnap a Force-sensitive Ithorian child named [[Pypey]]. However, Pypey's mother [[Oora]] had sent him away with a decoy droid. Kanan contacted Zeb and told him to find the other child. Zeb then left Chopper to babysit Alora in the ''Phantom''. Shortly later, Zeb encountered the decoy droid and convinced it that he was here to help. The droid handed Pypey over to Zeb and the Lasat proceeded to make his way back to the spaceport. However, he was soon sighted by the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister who pursued him to an apartment block.<ref name="Future of the Force" />

Zeb then contacted Kanan by comlink to update him about his new location. Zeb managed to hid in an apartment room and was quickly joined by Kanan and Ezra. Ezra's presence unsettled Pypey since the infant could sense his fear. As a result, the Inquisitors closed in on the rebels' location and proceeded to spike them out with lightsabers. Unwilling to handle a crying infant, Zeb handed Pypey over to Ezra. To elude the Inquisitors, the rebels decided to split up. While Ezra and Pypey headed into a ventilation shaft, Kanan and Zeb decided to hold off the Inquisitors.<ref name="Future of the Force" />

Eventually, Zeb and Kanan cornered the two Inquisitors, who were attempting to flush Ezra out of a ventilation shaft by poking their lightsabers through the ceiling. While Kanan tangled with the Seventh Sister, Zeb attacked the Fifth Brother but was quickly thrown aside by the Inquisitor. Unable to match the Inquisitors in combat, Zeb and Kanan jumped out the window and landed on a speeder. The Inquisitors followed them on another speeder and pursued the two rebels through the streets of Hammertown. Kanan managed to take out the Inquisitors' speeder with his bo-rifle but the Fifth Brother managed to disable the rebel's speeder with his lightsaber.<ref name="Future of the Force" />

Continuing on foot, Zeb and Kanan managed to reunite with Ezra and Pypey outside the spaceport. However, the gates were locked and they were soon cornered again by the Inquisitors. The Inquisitors quickly overpowered Zeb and Kanan with their [[the Force|Force]] powers and demanded that Ezra surrender the child. Before the Inquisitors could finish off their work, Ahsoka exited the doors and defeated the two Inquisitors in a lightsaber duel. While Ahsoka fought off the Inquisitors, Zeb and the other rebels evacuated with Pypey aboard the ''Phantom''. They managed to rescue Ahsoka after she was surrounded by Imperial reinforcements, who had been summoned by the Inquisitors.<ref name="Future of the Force" />

====Escape from Garel====
Prior to the Imperial attack on the rebel presence on Garel, Zeb and Chopper were shopping for supplies on the streets of Garel when he received word from Sabine that they should return to the ''Ghost''. Earlier that morning, Ezra had experienced a Force vision in which he saw his parents [[Ephraim Bridger|Ephraim]] and [[Mira Bridger]]. Sabine had also received intelligence that an Imperial fleet was departing from Lothal and feared that the Empire was preparing to attack Garel. Having encountered no Imperial patrols, Zeb was skeptical that the Empire was going to attack Lothal. However, Sabine revealed that it was a standard procedure for the Empire to withdraw patrols prior to launching a major strike.<ref name="Legacy">{{Rebels|Legacy (episode)|Legacy}}</ref>

Shortly later, Zeb and Chopper were pursued by several Imperial stormtroopers. They fled back to the ''Ghost{{'s}}'' spaceport hangar where a gunfight took place. During the gunfight, Zeb shot several stormtroopers while Chopper hid behind a stack of crates. After escaping Agent Kallus, the Fifth Brother, and the Seventh Sister, Zeb and his rebels fled aboard the ''Ghost''. Once airborne, Zeb manned the ''Ghost{{'s}}'' rear turret and exchanged fire with several TIE starfighters. When Hera undertook a dangerous maneuver to free Commander Sato's [[command ship]] ''Liberator'' from a [[Star Destroyer]]'s [[tractor beam projector]], Zeb narrowly avoided being crushed by against the projector. After escaping the Imperial fleet, the ''Ghost'' and the rest of the Phoenix [[Squadron]] fled into [[hyperspace]].<ref name="Legacy" />

====Rendezvousing with Leia====
[[File:Leia and the Ghost crew.png|thumb|left|250px|Orrelios and the crew work alongside Princess Leia Organa.]]
Following the escape from Garel, Zeb along with Hera and Sabine traveled to Lothal to rendezvous with [[Prince]]s [[Leia Organa]], the daughter of the Alderaanian Senator Bail Organa, who was secret supporting the rebellion. Hearing about the Phoenix rebels' losses, Bail had sent his daughter to supply three [[Sphyrna-class corvette|''Sphyrna''-class corvette]] to the rebels. Since the Alderaanians could not be seen directly supporting the rebels, Bail and Leia had arranged for the rebels to steal the ships on Lothal, an Imperial world. The crew of the ''Ghost'' arrived on Lothal in the midst of a skirmish between Kanan, Ezra, Chopper, Leia, and Imperial forces, who had attempted to arrest Chopper and [[Ryder Azadi]], the former governor of Lothal and a fugitive who had befriended the rebels.<ref name="A Princess on Lothal">{{Rebels|A Princess on Lothal}}</ref>

Since Leia was still posing as a "loyal" Imperial citizen and Kanan and Ezra were wearing Imperial uniforms, Zeb pretended to kidnap Kanan and Ezra. Meanwhile, Ryder likewise pretended to kidnap Leia. After escaping back aboard the ''Ghost'', Zeb and his fellow rebels learned about the passing of Ezra's parents and offered the youth their condolences. They then moved on to discuss their plans to "steal" Leia's three Hammerhead corvettes. Since Leia's ships were "stolen" by rebel elements frequently, the local Imperial official [[Supply Master]] Yogar Lyste had fitted the three corvettes with [[gravity lock]]s to deter futures thefts.<ref name="A Princess on Lothal" />

In order to infiltrate the Imperial depot, Kanan and Ezra posed as Imperial personnel who pretended to have rescued Leia from the rebels. While the Imperials were distracted, the crew of the ''Ghost'' and Ryder Azadi disabled the gravity locks and stole the starships. During the [[Mission on Lothal|raid]] on the Imperial depot, Zeb and Hera manned the ''Ghost'' and harried the depot's AT-AT walkers. The acquisition of the three Hammerhead corvettes supplemented the Phoenix Squadron's depleted forces. After completing their mission, Zeb and his comrades rejoined the Phoenix fleet in space.<ref name="A Princess on Lothal" />

====Trouble at Concord Dawn====
[[File:Concord Dawn planning.png|thumb|right|250px|Orrelios present at the planning of the mission to Concord Dawn.]]
Zeb and Ezra were present in the command room of the ''Liberator'' when the crew of the ''Ghost'' received news of Hera and Sabine's failed [[Dogfight over Concord Dawn|mission]] to seek permission from the Mandalorian [[Journeyman Protector|Protectors]] for safe passage through the [[Concord Dawn system]]. However, the Protectors' leader [[Fenn Rau]] had allied the Protectors with the Empire and had attacked Hera's mission, destroying several [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor]]s. Hera was badly wounded during the attack and had to be hospitalized.<ref name="The Protector of Concord Dawn">{{Rebels|The Protector of Concord Dawn}}</ref>

When Sabine suggested destroying the Protectors' [[Fang fighter]]s on the [[Third moon of Concord Dawn|third moon]] of [[Concord Dawn]], Zeb and Ezra expressed interest in accompanying Kanan for that mission. However, Kanan insisted only with Chopper to avoid endangering the other rebels. While Ezra and Zeb were upset, they complied with Kanan's orders. Despite Kanan's orders, Sabine came along; intent on seeking vengeace against Rau. Ultimately, the [[Mission to the third moon of Concord Dawn|mission]] was a success and the rebels succeeded in not only destroying the Protectors' starfighters but also capturing Rau.<ref name="The Protector of Concord Dawn" />

====Journey to Lira San====
After Ezra Bridger received a tip from the [[Weequay]] [[pirate]] [[Hondo Ohnaka]] about two refugees fleeing from the Empire, Zeb and the other crew of the ''Ghost'' traveled to [[Nixus Hub 218]]. There, they discovered Imperial forces arresting two [[Lasat]] refugees. Zeb and his fellow rebels attacked the stormtroopers and their commanding officer and rescued the two Lasat, who introduced themselves as the former Lasan Honor Guard [[Gron]] and the female mystic [[Chava]]. Both quickly recognized Zeb as a former [[captain]] from the Honor Guard; something which he had kept hidden from his fellow rebels. Shortly later, Hondo appeared and identified himself as Ezra's secret source.<ref name="Legends of the Lasat" />

With Imperial reinforcements bound to show up, Zeb and the other rebels along with the two Lasat headed back to the ''Ghost''. While traveling through Hub 218's halls, Gron and Chava revealed that they were traveling to [[Lira San]], a legendary planet that was regarded as a safe refugee for the Lasat species. Zeb scoffed at the [[Prophecy of the Three|prophecy]] and expressed skepticism that his species had a future. Shortly later, the rebels were pursued by more stormtroopers. Due to Hondo's intervention, the rebels were able to escape their Imperial pursuers and return to the ''Ghost'' with the Lasat refugees. Zeb and his companions then fled into hyperspace aboard the ''Ghost''.<ref name="Legends of the Lasat" />

[[File:Zeb finds the Lasat homeworld.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Zeb and the crew rediscover the original Lasat homeworld of Lira San.]]
After they had entered hyperspace, Chava told the rebels that she did know Lira San's location. In order to find it, Chava said that the "child" of prophecy must first save "the warrior" and "the fool." Zeb assumed that he was the warrior and that Ezra was the child but expressed bemusement at the identity of the fool. When Chava began a ritual to guide them to Lira San, Zeb refused to take part and returned to his quarters. Ezra left the ritual and talked to Zeb, who confessed that he was struggling with the guilt of his perceived failure to protect his people and the Lasan royal family during the [[Siege of Lasan]]. Ezra comforted his friend by encouraging Zeb to protect his people again by helping Chava and Gron find Lira San.<ref name="Legends of the Lasat" />

At Ezra's urging, Zeb agreed to participate in the ritual and assembled his bo-rifle in the ancient Lasat style, allowing it to interact with Chava's staff. Once Chopper had projected a [[hologram|holographic]] map of [[the galaxy]], the bo-rifle created a surge of energy that pointed to an uncharted area in [[Wild Space]], a region beyond the [[Outer Rim Territories]]. Believing that the prophecy could be true, Hera and Sabine plotted a course using those coordinates. Upon emerging from hyperspace, the ''Ghost'' encountered an imploded [[Star cluster/Legends|star cluster]] blocking their path to their destination. Chava quickly recognized this as the maze from the ancient Lasat prophecy.<ref name="Legends of the Lasat" />

The rebels' problems were further compounded when Agent Kallus arrived with an [[Arquitens-class command cruiser|''Arquitens''-class command cruiser]]. When Chava identified Kallus as the "warrior" from the prophecy, Zeb was initially dismissive of that idea due to his hatred for the man who had played a role in Lasan's destruction. When Chava then explained that everyone could fulfill the three roles of warrior, fool, and child over time, Zeb realized that he had to forge his own destiny and that of the Lasat. Taking a leap of faith, Zeb used the power generated by his bo-rifle to guide the ''Ghost'' into the cluster and find Lira San. The ''Ghost'' entered the cluster but was miraculously unharmed by its gravitational pull. The ''Ghost{{'s}}'' hyperdrive then automatically jumped into the middle of the star cluster. Meanwhile, Agent Kallus was forced to retreat after losing two TIE fighters and sustaining damage to his warship from the star cluster's gravitational pull.<ref name="Legends of the Lasat" />

During the jump into hyperspace, Zeb and his rebels were engulfed by a blinding light and knocked unconscious. When they awoke, they found themselves in uncharted space but quickly spotted the planet Lira San. Zeb, Gron, and Chava then traveled on the ''Phantom'' to Lira San's surface while the other rebels stayed behind. Upon landing on Lira San, Zeb and the other two Lasat discovered that the planet was inhabited by millions of Lasat and that Lira San was the Lasat species' original homeworld. Resolving to guide other surviving Lasat to Lira San and regarding his fellow rebels as a family, Zeb returned to the ''Ghost'' and shared the news with his rebel comrades. Using the route that Zeb had discovered through the star cluster, the rebels then plotted a safe course back into known space.<ref name="Legends of the Lasat" />

====Raid on the Asteroid Gas Refinery====
Zeb and his rebel companions later took part in a [[Heist at the Asteroid Belt Gas Refinery|raid]] on a [[Mining Guild]] [[Asteroid Belt Gas Refinery]] to obtain fuel supplies for the ''Ghost'' and the Phoenix Squadron. On the way, the ''Ghost'' encountered a herd of [[purrgil]]s, large space-dwelling creatures capable of traveling through hyperspace. While Hera was fearful of the giant space creatures, Ezra believed that the purrgil did not pose a threat to the ''Ghost''. The crew of the ''Ghost'' came to the aid of the purrgil when two [[TIE/mg Mining Guild starfighter]]s attacked the herd. During the brief dogfight, Zeb was in the ''Phantom'' when Hera drained its power to allow Ezra and Kanan to shoot down the TIE fighters.<ref name="The Call">{{Rebels|The Call}}</ref>

As they approached the gas refinery, the rebels quickly realized that the purrgils were after the [[Clouzon-36]] gas being extracted there. Zeb and his fellow rebels also attended a briefing in the ''Ghost{{'s}}'' cockpit prior to the raid on the asteroid refinery. As Zeb entered the room, he complained that ''Ghost{{'s}}'' doors were no longer automatic. During the briefing, Zeb listened as Sabine and Hera outlined their plans for the raid. Kanan, Ezra, Chopper, and Sabine would jump onto the refinery's bridge, blow up the facility, and secure the landing zone where several canisters of Clouzon-36 were waiting to be picked up by the Empire.<ref name="The Call" />

While the other rebels took part in the raid, Zeb and Hera stayed aboard the ''Ghost''. After Ezra convinced the other rebels not to blow up the facility, Zeb and Hera were made aware of this change in plan. At Sabine's behest, they landed the ''Ghost'' on the gas refinery's platform. While Hera piloted the ship, Zeb manned the laser cannons. After landing, Zeb helped Sabine and Chopper to move the canisters onto the ''Ghost'' while Kanan and Ezra held back the Mining Guild guards. Zeb used one of the canisters to power up the ''Ghost''.<ref name="The Call" />

Towards the end of the skirmish, Zeb and his fellow rebels were cornered by the Mining Guild [[Boss]] [[Yushyn]], several Rodian guards, and two TIE fighters. Fortunately for Zeb and his comrades, Ezra resurfaced with several purrgil reinforcements which overpowered the guards. This allowed the crew of the ''Ghost'' to complete their refueling and reloading and they departed into space. Before leaving, the ''Ghost'' destroyed the gas refinery in order to deny it to the Empire. Later in space, Zeb and his fellow rebels were reunited with Ezra, who revealed that he had managed to establish a connection with the purrgils, who depended on the Clouzon-36 for food and jumping into hyperspace. Zeb and his fellow rebels later followed the purrgil herd through hyperspace.<ref name="The Call" />

====Mission to Ryloth====
[[File:The crew of the Ghost.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Zeb with his fellow rebels after the mission on Ryloth and Hera reconciled with her father.]]
Garazeb Orrelios and Hera participated in a mission to steal supplies from the Empire. During the mission, one of the rebel fleet's Hammerhead corvettes transferred some cargo to the ''Ghost'' while being pursued by an Imperial Star Destroyer. After Zeb had finished load the cargo, the rebel fleet began jumping into space. However, the [[Phoenix Squadron]] [[pilot]] [[Phoenix Two]]'s A-wing starfighter's [[hyperdrive]] was damaged, stranding it in [[realspace|space]]. Phoenix Two attempted to dock her starfighter with the ''Ghost{{'s}}'' docking ring but was hit by enemy fire. Zeb and Hera managed to flee into hyperspace before the Imperials caught up with them.<ref name="Homecoming">{{Rebels|Homecoming}}</ref>

With the rebels losing starfighters and pilots at a faster rate than they could replace them, the crew of the ''Ghost'' embarked on a mission to steal an [[Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier|Imperial fighter carrier]] seen orbiting [[Ryloth]], the homeworld of the [[Twi'lek]] species. Since the Spectres needed help, Hera contacted her estranged father [[Cham Syndulla]], who was the head of the [[Free Ryloth movement|Ryloth rebels]]. Zeb and the other rebels were present when Cham and his companions [[Numa]] and [[Gobi Glie]] rendezvoused with them aboard the ''Ghost'' in deep space.<ref name="Homecoming" />

Zeb was later present during a briefing when Hera outlined her plans to use a stolen [[TIE/sa bomber]] to infiltrate and hijack the fighter carrier. However, Cham disagreed with her plan and advocated destroying the carrier to demonstrate the strength of the Ryloth resistance. After some argument, Cham reluctantly agreed to assist Hera's rebels in stealing the Imperial carrier. For their mission, Zeb and his fellow rebels traveled to the [[Ryloth system]] in Cham's [[Nu-class transport|''Nu''-class transport]]. After exiting hyperspace, the two rebel cells boarded their TIE bomber and headed towards the fighter carrier.<ref name="Homecoming" />

To trick the Imperials into letting them land, Hera had arranged for two rebel A-wings to attack their TIE bomber. The Imperials fell for this ruse and allowed the rebels to land their stolen TIE bomber in a hangar bay. Upon landing however, Cham and his companions turned the tables on the crew of the ''Ghost'' and [[stun]]ned them. They then proceeded to carry out their original mission to destroy the fighter carrier. After awakening from the effects of being stunned, Zeb joined his fellow rebels in stopping the Ryloth rebels from carrying out their plot. While Hera, Kanan, Chopper, and Ezra headed to the ship's command bridge, Zeb and Sabine headed to the munition racks to stop Numa and Gobi from detonating their explosives.<ref name="Homecoming" />

Zeb and Sabine eventually encountered Numa and Gobi in the middle of a blaster battle with stormtroopers. Following a struggle, Zeb and Sabine managed to trip the two Twi'leks with a [[MSE-6 series repair droid|rigged mouse droid]], knocking them unconscious. They then bound their prisoners. Meanwhile, the other Spectres managed to force the Imperials to abandon the ship. Hera also managed to convince Cham to put aside their differences and to work together to keep the Imperials from retaking the ship. Joining forces, the two rebel cells managed to repel Imperial reinforcements. During the fighting, Zeb and Sabine worked with Numa and Gobi to shoot down Imperial TIE fighters. After repairing the hyperdrive and destroying an Imperial light cruiser, Zeb and his rebel companions escaped aboard the fighter carrier into hyperspace. Later, Zeb and the other crew of the ''Ghost'' farewelled Cham and his companions. By then, Hera had also reconciled with her father.<ref name="Homecoming" />

====Mission to Oliu====
Sometime later, Orrelios, Bridger, Wren, Jarrus, Kitwarr, and Wullffwarro went on a [[Mission to Oliu|mission]] to the planet [[Oliu]].<ref name="A Time to Survive">{{SWRMCite||A Time to Survive}}</ref>

====Mission to Geonosis====
[[File:The rebels arrive at Geonosis.png|thumb|left|250px|After reports of a project over Geonosis were discovered the Spectres went to investigate.]]
After rebel intelligence discovered that the Empire was building [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|something]] above the planet [[Geonosis]], Zeb accompanied his fellow rebels on a [[Ambush on an Imperial construction module|mission]] to investigate an [[ICM-092792|Imperial construction module]]. While Hera, Rex, and Chopper stayed aboard the ''Ghost'', Zeb along with Kanan, Sabine, and Ezra ventured aboard the construction module only to stumble into a trap set by the ISB Agent Kallus, a perennial foe of the Spectres who had played a role in the Siege of Lasan.<ref name="The Honorable Ones">{{Rebels|The Honorable Ones}}</ref>

Zeb and his rebel companions fought against the Imperials with the Lasat finding himself locked in melee combat with Kallus. While Zeb's rebel companions managed to make their way back to the ''Ghost'', Zeb was separated and fled into an escape pod. However, the Lasat warrior was followed by Kallus and the two continued their fight aboard the vehicle. As the pod lurched towards Geonosis, Zeb threw Kallus onto the controls; breaking them and causing the vehicle to crash-land into a cavern on [[Bahryn]], an icy moon that orbited Geonosis.<ref name="The Honorable Ones" />

Zeb survived the crash unscathed but Kallus sustained a broken foot. After emerging from the escape pod, Zeb began to gather supplies from the ship. Kallus, who was lying wounded on the icy ground, taunted Zeb by telling that the Empire would eventually find them. Zeb responded that he was not going to let it happen. As the night got colder, Zeb took out a portable heater but it was not enough to keep them warm. When Zeb expressed bemusement that Geonosis had icy weather, Kallus informed him that they had landed on one of its moons.<ref name="The Honorable Ones" />

Zeb then entered the pod and managed to find a [[Escape pod transponder|transponder]] only to discover it had been damaged. Kallus suggested that Zeb repair it so that the Empire would be able to find them. At the same, they heard a distant roar. Distrusting the Empire, Zeb remarked that he would take his chances with the cold and whatever [[bonzami|beast]] was in the cavern rather than risk being jailed by the Empire. Kallus responded that he would do his best to ensure that Zeb got a fair trial. However, Zeb was skeptical of Kallus' promises; having seen what the Empire had done to his people and the galaxy.<ref name="The Honorable Ones" />

Later that night, Zeb managed to repair the escape pod's transponder. To pass the time, Zeb and Kallus exchange views about the Empire and the rebellion. When their heater broke down, Zeb managed to find an alternative heat source in the form of a meteorite. Since the transponder's signal was unable to leave the cavern, Zeb made two attempts to climb out of the cavern but failed, prompting Kallus to snigger at him. Before the two could fight, they were attacked by the creature they had heard earlier, which turned out to be a bonzami. In the end, Zeb and Kallus joined forces and managed to drive the beast away.<ref name="The Honorable Ones" />

[[File:Zeb and Kallus fight a bonzami.png|thumb|right|250px|In order to survive, old enemies join forces on the ice moon of Bahryn.]]
After driving the bonzami away, Zeb questioned Kallus about the Imperial [[Sterilization of Geonosis]], something which Kallus insisted he was innocent or unaware of. As the two discussed a way to escape the cavern before the bonzami returned with back-up, Zeb examined bo-rifle trophy and discovered that it had been modified for close-quarters combat. When Zeb asked Kallus how he had obtained the bo-rifle, the ISB agent revealed that he had not stolen it. Instead, Kallus explained that a Lasat warrior whom he had defeated had given it to him for fighting honorably; which Zeb recognized as a Lasat custom.<ref name="The Honorable Ones" />

When Zeb talked about the Imperial pacification of Lasan, Kallus recounted a violent encounter with rebels on [[Onderon]] during the early years of the Empire. [[Alexsandr Kallus' first Imperial platoon|Kallus' unit]] had been ambushed by a [[Unidentified Lasat mercenary|Lasat mercenary]] who brutally massacred all his men but spared Kallus. Upon learning of Kallus' near-death encounter, Zeb felt regret and commented that not every Lasat was the same, to which Kallus compares the Imperials. After resolving their difference and reaching a better understanding of each other, Zeb and Kallus decided to climb out together.<ref name="The Honorable Ones" />

However, as they were climbing towards the surface, the bonzami came back with reinforcements. Following a struggle involving Zeb throwing Kallus to the surface, the two unlikely allies managed to reach to the top. Kallus gained Zeb's respect by using his bo-rifle to shoot one of the bonzami. After reaching the surface, the two eventually managed to find shelter from a blizzard. While hunkering down, Kallus expressed regret about his involvement in the Fall of Lasan but insisted that it wasn't personal. Zeb then responded that he had already come to terms with that traumatic event.<ref name="The Honorable Ones" />

The follow morning, Zeb and Kallus were woken up by the roar of engines. Zeb quickly discovered that the ''Ghost'' had picked up his transponder signal. When Zeb invited Kallus aboard and stressed that the rebels would treat him fairly, Kallus responded that he preferred to take his chances with the Empire. As a parting gift, Zeb left him the meteorite they had found as a token of their new-found friendship. Zeb was greeted by his fellow rebels (except Chopper) at the gangplank of the ''Ghost''. When Ezra remarked that it was freezing, Zeb responded that the youth had only been there for two seconds. Zeb and his companions then returned to space.<ref name="The Honorable Ones" />

====Parting with the Jedi====
After Ezra, Kanan, and Chopper had returned from a mission to scout the planet [[Oosalon]] as a potential rebel base, Zeb and Hera greeted their comrades aboard the ''Ghost''. Earlier, Kanan had instructed Hera to rendezvous the ''Ghost'' with the ''Phantom'' in deep space away from the fleet. When Ezra and Kanan entered the ship, Zeb had been cleaning his bo-rifle. The Lasat asked the two Jedi whether they had discovered a new site for the rebels. In response, Kanan told them that he and Ezra had run into two Inquisitors known as the Fifth Brother and Seventh Sister respectively. Kanan also expressed his fears that the Inquisitors were preventing him and Ezra from helping the rebels to start up a new base.<ref name="Shroud of Darkness">{{Rebels|Shroud of Darkness}}</ref>

Earlier, Ahsoka Tano, a Jedi friend of the Spectres, had visited the ''Ghost''. Later, she along with Kanan, Ezra, and Chopper departed on the ''Phantom'' for the [[Lothal Jedi Temple]] where they hoped to commune with Master [[Yoda]]. As the ''Phantom'' departed into hyperspace, Zeb along with Hera and Sabine watched from the ''Ghost{{'s}}'' window. To protect the rebellion, Kanan had decided not to reveal their whereabouts to the other rebels.<ref name="Shroud of Darkness" />

====Heist at Horizon Base====
[[File:Horizon Base.png|thumb|left|250px|Low on fuel Zeb and the other Spectres took part on a raid on Horizon Base.]]
Zeb and his fellow rebels attended a meeting on the former Imperial fighter carrier, which had become the new Phoenix flagship, to discuss the establishment of a rebel base on [[Berzite's moon]] in the [[Yost system]]. Since the rebels were low on fuel, Sabine's friend [[Ketsu Onyo]] instead recommended that the rebels steal fuel from the Imperial depot at [[Horizon Base]]. Commander Sato consented to the plan and sent the crew of the ''Ghost'' to Horizon Base. Zeb and his fellow rebels with the exception of Chopper took part in the mission. Chopper was supposed to guard the ''Ghost'' but was distracted by the sight of a new [[ambulatory strut|droid leg]] being sold at a nearby stall. Zeb and Ezra were unsympathetic to Chopper and taunted him about "going shopping".<ref name="The Forgotten Droid">{{Rebels|The Forgotten Droid}}</ref>

The crew of the ''Ghost'' managed to steal the fuel but were pursued by Imperial stormtroopers. All of the rebels managed to escaped but Chopper was left behind since he had been preoccupied with the leg. Upon arriving back at the Phoenix fleet, Zeb and his fellow rebels found the fleet under attack from Imperial forces under [[Admiral]] [[Kassius Konstantine]], who tried to prevent the ''Ghost'' from docking with the rebel fighter carrier. However, the rebels were able to land in one of the carrier's hangar bays with the help of Ketsu, who used her ''[[Shadow Caster]]'' to protect the ''Ghost'' from enemy fire. Upon landing, Zeb and Ezra began unload fuel canisters. While the rebel fleet was preparing to travel to the Yost system, Hera and Commander Sato received a warning from Chopper and his new friend [[AP-5]] that the Imperials had set a trap in the Yost system. AP-5 also gave the rebel fleet the coordinates for [[Atollon]], a world without an Imperial presence.<ref name="The Forgotten Droid" />

Zeb and his fellow rebels traveled to Atollon where they were reunited with Chopper and AP-5. Zeb and his fellow rebels were present when Sabine repaired AP-5 using parts from Chopper's stolen droid leg. He watched with bemusement when AP-5 chided Chopper for the "illogical act" of sacrificing his brand new droid leg, which prompted a heated exchange between the two droids.<ref name="The Forgotten Droid" />

====Building Chopper Base====
[[File:Chopper Base.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Zeb and his fellow rebels helped establish Chopper Base unaware of the dangers they would face.]]
Following the discover of Atollon, the Phoenix rebels established a base on the planet called [[Chopper Base]]. Zeb and his fellow rebels helped ferry supplies from the fleet to Chopper Base. Zeb and Chopper accompanied the Spectres during a supply run to deliver several power generators. After finishing their run, Zeb took the opportunity to relax on a cliff outside the base which overlooked the desert and several large [[coral]] plants. Zeb was also listening to music under Atollon's sunset when Ezra joined him. When the young Jedi expressed his worries about not meeting again, Zeb reassured his younger friend by telling him that they would have overthrown the Empire by the time he and Kanan had returned. He suggested they could then share war stories.<ref name="Mystery">{{Rebels|The Mystery of Chopper Base}}</ref>

Later that evening, Zeb and the other rebels responded to a distress call from Sabine, who had accompanied Rex on a mission to investigate the disappearance of [[Lieutenant]] [[Dicer]]. Dicer had been planting a [[sensor beacon|sensor marker]] in the base's northern perimeter when she disappeared. Sabine and Rex had visited the site only to be attacked by several large spidery creatures called [[krykna]]. The ''Ghost'' arrived managed to chase away the creatures but Rex was taken by the krykna to their underground nest.<ref name="Mystery" />

Despite his reputation as a fierce fighter, Zeb was frightened by the krykna and offered to guard the ''Ghost''. However, Hera instructed him to accompany them and instead assigned Chopper the job of guarding the ship. While underground, Zeb accompanied Hera and Sabine while Kanan and Ezra went to explore a different section. Zeb and his companions eventually found Rex and managed to free him but were unable to find Dicer. While being pursued by several krykna, Zeb and his companions reunited with Kanan and Ezra. Together, they made their way out of the tunnels and fled back to the ''Ghost''.<ref name="Mystery" />

Once aboard the ship, Zeb along with Kanan and Ezra used the ship's laser cannons to fight off the intruders. However, the ''Ghost'' was unable to leave because the krykna had spun a large web around the ship. When Ezra suggested cutting through the web in order to free the ''Ghost'', Zeb's reluctance annoyed the young Jedi, who remarked that he did not want to be chomped up by the creatures because they were too afraid to go outside. In the end, the rebels managed to break free of the web by concocting a plan which involved Sabine distracting the creatures with the sensor marker while Ezra and Kanan used their lightsabers to slice through the web. Following the skirmish with the krykna, the Phoenix rebels erected a fence of sensor markers around Chopper Base to deter the krykna. Zeb along with Hera and Sabine stayed behind while Kanan and Ezra traveled with the former Jedi Ahsoka to [[Malachor]].<ref name="Mystery" />

====Staying behind on Atollon====
Zeb and the other rebels including Rex stayed behind at Chopper Base while Kanan, Ezra, and Chopper accompanied Ahsoka on a [[Mission to Malachor|mission]] to Malachor. Zeb and his fellow rebels later greeted Kanan, Ezra, and Chopper when the ''Phantom'' landed at Chopper Base. Zeb watched in silence while the now-blinded Kanan hugged Hera. He and his fellow rebels were also saddened when they saw that Ahsoka had not come with Ezra and Kanan. Later, Zeb and his fellow rebels returned to the ''Ghost'' where they silently came to terms with Kanan's blindness and Ahsoka's apparent death.<ref name="Twilight">{{Rebels|Twilight of the Apprentice}}</ref>

====Rescuing Hondo Ohnaka====
[[File:Steps Into Shadow thumb.png|thumb|left|250px|During a mission to rescue Hondo from prison Zeb witnesses Ezra step further towards the dark side.]]
Following the events on Malachor, Zeb took part in a rebel mission led by Ezra to [[Rescue of Hondo Ohnaka|rescue]] the Weequay pirate Hondo Ohnaka from the [[Naraka prison|Imperial prison]] on [[Naraka]], whom they had encountered earlier at Nixus Hub 218. While Hera waited aboard the ''Ghost'', Zeb and the other rebels climbed under a bridge to avoid Imperial sentries. Zeb pulled a stormtrooper to his death while Ezra pushed another down into the ravine. After climbing onto the bridge with Sabine, they were joined by Chopper who jumped down a cliff. Chopper did not activate his [[rocket booster]]s in order to avoid triggering the Imperial sensor lights. Zeb managed to catch the astromech droid in time.<ref name="Steps">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Steps Into Shadow]]''</ref>

The rebels then headed inside the Naraka prison where they freed Hondo and his Ugnaught companion [[Terba]] from their cell. Following a brief firefight, they managed to evade stormtroopers. However, Terba was killed during the escape attempt by an AT-DP walker. Zeb took up position outside the prison while Sabine and Chopper took out the pursuers and Ezra used the Force to compel the [[Imperial combat driver|AT-DP pilot]] to walk off the edge of the platform. The rebels then fled aboard the ''Ghost''. Once aboard, Zeb told Hera that Ezra had used a [[mind trick]] on the Imperial pilot.<ref name="Steps" />

====Heist at Reklam Station====
[[File:Rebels on Reklam Station.png|thumb|right|250px|Zeb and his team go to Yarma on a mission to capture Y-wings at Reklam Station.]]
After returning to Chopper Base, Zeb was present at a briefing where Hondo revealed that the Galactic Empire was dismantling [[Galactic Republic|Old Republic]] [[Y-wing starfighter|Y-wings]] at [[Reklam Station]] inside the gas planet of [[Yarma]]. Zeb along with Sabine, Chopper, Rex, and Hondo later joined a recon mission led by Ezra, who had been promoted to the rank of [[Lieutenant Commander]] in the light of his success on Naraka. The rebels traveled to Yarma on the ''Phantom''.<ref name="Steps" />

While traveling to Yarma, the rebels escaped a Mining Guild patrol at [[Sereeda Waypoint]]. Once inside the gassy planet, the rebels were attacked by two Imperial [[DTS-series Dismantler Droid]]s. Rex attempted to fight one of the pursuers but fell out of the ''Phantom''{{'s}} rear hatch. However, Zeb grabbed on to his rebel comrade and pulled him aboard the ship. After dispatching the dismantler droids, Sabine parked the ''Phantom'' beneath Reklam Station. The rebels and Hondo then managed to convince the Ugnaught laborers aboard Reklam Station to help them steal the Y-wings in return for their freedom.<ref name="Steps" />

After the Ugnaughts disabled the conveyor belt system, Zeb and his team began refueling the Y-wings. However, they were spotted by an Imperial dismantler droid which alerted the Imperial Commander [[Brom Titus]]. Titus activated the magnetic locks, preventing the rebels from escaping with their stolen Y-wings. When the dismantler droid attacked Chopper and Sabine and tried to shake them off a Y-wing, Zeb tried to come to their aid but was no match for the "clanker". Rex then managed to push the droid off the edge of Reklam Station, sending it to its destruction in the depths of Yarma.<ref name="Steps" />

Meanwhile, Ezra managed to knock out the power systems, which disabled the magnetic locks. When Sabine ordered Chopper to use the relay navigation system to autopilot the Y-wings, Zeb shoved a reluctant Chopper into a Y-wing's [[astromech socket]]. The rebels minus Ezra then escaped into space but were intercepted by an Imperial Star Destroyer commanded by Governor [[Arihnda Pryce]]. Following a brief dogfight, the rebels were rescued by Phoenix Squadron. Zeb and his team landed the five surviving Y-wings inside the ''Quasar Fire''-class cruiser-carrier ''[[Phoenix Nest]]''.<ref name="Steps" />

After fleeing into hyperspace, the rebels returned to Chopper Base. When Hera reprimanded Ezra for disobeying orders, endangering his crew, and getting the ''Phantom'' destroyed, Zeb tried to take responsibility. However, Hera insisted that the mission was Ezra's responsibility.<ref name="Steps" />

====Captives of Maul====
[[File:Maul and the Ghost crew captives.jpg|thumb|left|250px|After falling into a trap Zeb and his companions found themselves in the grip of Maul.]]
Zeb along with Hera, Chopper, and Sabine were taken captive by the former Sith apprentice [[Maul]], whom Ezra and Kanan had encountered earlier on Malachor. Maul had lured the crew of the ''Ghost'' into a trap by attacking a ''Sphyrna''-class corvette that was part of the Phoenix cell. Maul threatened to execute the hostages if Kanan and Ezra failed to bring him [[Kanan Jarrus' holocron|Kanan's Jedi holocron]] and the [[Sith holocron]] that Ezra had obtained on Malachor. After Maul deduced that the ''Ghost'' was their home, Zeb asked the Dark Sider if he was going to move in. Zeb and Sabine protested when Maul forced Hera to take him on a tour of the ''Ghost'' in order to find Kanan's Jedi holocron.<ref name="Holocrons">{{Rebels|The Holocrons of Fate}}</ref>

Later, Hera staged an escape attempt. At her signal, Zeb kicked Chopper into two of Maul's repurposed [[RIC-1200|tour guide droids]]. The rebels then knocked out the remaining droids before making their way into the engine room. Zeb carried Chopper down the ladder. Once inside the cargo hold, the rebels tried to trap Maul with the [[magnetizer]]. However, the Sith Lord broke free from the magnetizer with his [[Maul's lightsaber|lightsaber]]. He then reasserted his authority over the crew and warned them that they were only alive because he still needed them. Maul took his captives to an abandoned Mandalorian asteroid station called [[Vizsla Keep 09]].<ref name="Holocrons" />

While Zeb and the other rebels remained aboard the ''Ghost'', Maul greeted Kanan and Ezra. After collecting the Sith holocron, Maul led Ezra to the command center. He then gave orders that the prisoners be executed. Before the tour guide droids could carry out the sentence, Kanan sneaked up behind Maul's droids and beheaded them with his [[Kanan's lightsaber|lightsaber]]. The rebels then rushed to the command room to confront Maul but were blinded by a bright pink light created by the holocrons. Kanan managed to convince Ezra to close his eyes; ending the ritual. However, Maul managed to escape into space.<ref name="Holocrons" />

====Mission to Teralov====
After Imperial forces [[Massacre near Teralov|destroyed]] a rebel convoy near [[Teralov]], Zeb and the other Spectres attended a briefing at Chopper Base chaired by Commander Sato. During the briefing, the rebels learned from an agent codenamed [[Fulcrum (title)|Fulcrum]] that several Imperial cadets were planning to defect from the elite [[Skystrike Academy]]. The former cadet Sabine was assigned the [[Escape from Skystrike Academy|mission]] while Zeb accompanied Hera on a second supply run to Teralov. Later, Zeb was present when Sabine, [[Wedge Antilles]], and [[Derek Klivian|Hobbie]] arrived safely in Chopper Base.<ref name="Antilles Extraction">{{Rebels|The Antilles Extraction}}</ref>

====Return to Ryloth====
[[File:Lothal and Ryloth rebels join forces.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|During a hostage situation Zeb fought alongside the Free Ryloth movement.]]
Later, Zeb and his fellow rebels returned to Ryloth to deliver supplies to Hera's father Cham Syndulla, who was the leader of the Free Ryloth movement. The ''Ghost'' managed to pick up Cham and his fellow fighter Numa, who were being pursued by Imperial [[scout trooper]]s on [[614-AvA speeder bike]]s. Cham and Numa managed to ride their [[blurrg]] steeds aboard the ''Ghost'' but one of the scout troopers followed them. Zeb knocked out the scout trooper and Ezra stole his armor.<ref name="Hera's Heroes">{{Rebels|Hera's Heroes}}</ref>

Once aboard, Cham briefed the rebels about the recent Imperial advances made by [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]] in the [[Tann Province]]. Zeb and the other rebels volunteered to help Hera recover a priceless heirloom, the [[Kalikori]], from her [[Syndulla residence|family home]]. While Hera, Ezra, and Chopper infiltrated the Syndulla home, Zeb and the other rebels staged a diversionary attack on Imperial forces in the [[Tulara Ravine]]. After destroying an AT-DP walker and an Imperial Troop Transport, the rebels retreated but were pursued by a second AT-DP walker.<ref name="Hera's Heroes" />

Despite trying to block the walker's advance, Zeb and the rebels were forced into a gun battle. The walker later ceased firing in order to broadcast a hologram message from Captain [[Slavin]], Thrawn's second-in-command. Slavin revealed that the Imperials had captured Hera and Ezra. He offered to spare their lives if Cham agreed to surrender to the Empire. Cham proceeded with the offer and the rebels traveled aboard the ''Ghost'' to the Syndulla residence. However, all of the rebels were able to escape when Chopper ignited several explosives that damaged the Syndulla residence. Despite failing to recover the Kalikori from Thrawn, the rebels were able to escape on the ''Ghost'' into the wilderness. Zeb later mingled with Cham's fighters and hugged Ezra.<ref name="Hera's Heroes" />

====Mission to Agamar====
[[File:Rebels and Rex part as friends with Kalani.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|After resolving old tensions Zeb and his fellow rebels left Agamar and parted from Kalani on good terms.]]
Later, Zeb joined the other Spectres and Rex on a [[Mission to Agamar (2 BBY)|mission]] to salvage [[proton bomb]]s from a wrecked [[DH-Omni Support Vessel|Separatist supply ship]] on the planet [[Agamar]]. After disembarking from the ''Ghost'', Zeb along with Ezra and Kanan learned more about the Clone Wars from Rex. While inspecting the munitions depot, the rebels found that it was fully loaded with proton bombs. The rebels then stumbled into a [[ray shield]] trap and found themselves captured by a group of [[B1 battle droid]]s led by [[B1-268]]. B1-268 was about to execute the intruders but received orders from his commander to stun them and bring them into custody.<ref name="The Last Battle">{{Rebels|The Last Battle}}</ref>

Zeb and the other rebels including Rex awoke to find themselves prisoners of [[Kalani (super tactical droid)|Kalani]], who led a [[Separatist holdouts|Separatist holdout]] that escaped the shut down of the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist]] [[Separatist Droid Army|Droid Army]] that accompanied [[Order 66]]. Seeking to end the Clone Wars as a victory for the Separatist Alliance, Kalani forced his prisoners to take part in a combat simulation. When Zeb refused, Kalani concurred on the grounds that the Lasats had not participated in the Clone Wars. He instead designated Zeb as a hostage for the others rescue from his command bridge. The other rebels, at Ezra's behest, agreed to participate in the match on the grounds that Kalani freed Chopper if they won and released his stockpile of proton bombs. Kalani agreed to their terms.<ref name="The Last Battle" />

A bound Zeb watched the simulation from Kalani's command bridge. When Zeb's rebel friends scattered Kalani's first assault wave, Zeb tried to convince the tactical droid to surrender. However, Kalani did not humor Zeb and revealed that he had set a trap for the rebels in the [[hangar]] bay. However, the rebels managed to defeat Kalani's [[droideka]]s and forced their way into the command bridge. Rex and the rebels declared victory but Kalani refused to accept it on technical grounds. Before he could execute Zeb, Ezra managed to convince Kalani to put side his animosity towards Rex on the grounds that the fighting between the droids and clones had allowed the Empire to take over the galaxy. After Imperial forces arrived and attacked Kalani's droids, the two asides agreed to put aside their differences in order to escape Agamar.<ref name="The Last Battle" />

Working together, the rebels and Kalani came up with a plan to delay the advancing Imperial forces by rolling proton bombs onto the feet of their AT-AT and AT-DP walkers. During the fight, Zeb threw a [[grenade]] which damaged an Imperial AT-DP walker. After damaging the front legs of an advancing AT-AT walker, the rebels and droids fled in three [[Sheathipede-class transport shuttle|Neimodian escort shuttles]] that had been repaired by Chopper. While one of the shuttles was shot down, Zeb, his companions, and Kalani's shuttle managed to flee into space. The two sides parted on friendly terms with Kalani opining that the rebellion had a small chance of success against the Empire. Shortly later, they were contacted by Hera. Despite not obtaining the proton bombs, the rebels managed to find a [[Phantom II|new transport]] for the ''Ghost''.<ref name="The Last Battle" />

====Trouble on Concord Dawn====
Zeb interrupted a conversation between Sabine and Fenn Rau to inform them that Hera Syndulla had summoned them for a briefing in the war room. During the briefing, Hera outlined that the rebels had lost contact with the Protectors on the third moon of Concord Dawn. When Rau offered to investigate on behalf of the rebels, Zeb asked whether Rau was their prisoner. Kanan responded that Rau was merely a "grumpy house guest." Hera dispatched Rau along with Sabine, Ezra, and Chopper on a [[Second mission to the third moon of Concord Dawn|recon probe]]. After discovering that the Imperial [[Viceroy]] [[Gar Saxon]] had destroyed the Protectors, Rau decided to join the rebellion.<ref name="ISC">{{Rebels|Imperial Super Commandos}}</ref>

====Evacuation of Mykapo====
Zeb and his fellow Spectres later accompanied Phoenix Squadron on a [[Skirmish over Mykapo|mission]] to evacuate rebel sympathizers from the planet [[Mykapo]] prior to an impending Imperial crackdown. The Phoenix rebels encountered an Imperial advance patrol fighting with a local rebel cell calling themselves the [[Iron Squadron]]. The Iron Squadron used their [[YT-2400 light freighter]] ''[[Sato's Hammer]]'' to destroy an Imperial ''Gozanti''-class cruiser and declined the rebels' offer of assistance. Under Hera's orders Zeb and Kanan, traveled down to Mykapo on the ''Phantom II'' to assist with the evacuations. Zeb dismissed the Iron Squadron as a bunch of "Ezras." Later, they and the rest of Phoenix Squadron with the exception of Ezra, Sabine, and Chopper traveled back to the rebel fleet. Zeb and the Spectres later joined forces with Iron Squadron to rescue the Squadron's captain [[Mart Mattin]] from Imperial forces.<ref name="Iron Squadron">{{Rebels|Iron Squadron (episode)|Iron Squadron}}</ref>

====Mission to Wynkahthu====
[[File:The Wynkahthu Job thumb.png|thumb|right|300px|On a mission to find cargo on Wynkahthu Zeb, his team, Azmorigan and his associates met resistance from Imperial sentry droids.]]
At the urging of Ezra, Zeb and his fellow Spectres agreed to meet with Hondo, who requested their assistance in recovering cargo from a derelict [[Imperial cargo ship]] trapped in the upper atmosphere of the planet [[Wynkahthu]]. Due to their previous encounter with Hondo, Zeb along with Hera and Sabine were unwilling to work with the Weequay pirate and his business partner Azmorigan. However, the rebels agreed to help after Hondo revealed that the cargo ship was carrying a shipment of proton bombs; a commodity needed by the rebellion.<ref name="The Wynkahthu Job">{{Rebels|The Wynkahthu Job}}</ref>

Since the cargo ship was trapped over a vortex, the rebels were unable to access the cargo through normal means. As a result, Hera tasked the former Imperial [[inventory droid]] AP-5 with working with Zeb to come up with a plan to recover the cargo. She also assigned Zeb leadership of the mission to voice her protest at Ezra's fraternization with Hondo. When Ezra protested, Zeb responded that it was his turn to lead a rebel mission. Working with AP-5, Zeb devised a plan which involved the rebels landing on the cargo ship's hull, making their way to the ship's cargo hold and opening its outer doors to allow extraction.<ref name="The Wynkahthu Job" />

Zeb briefed his recovery team in the ''Ghost''{{'s}} cargo bay, which included Ezra, Chopper, Hondo, and Azmorigan. When Ezra made fun of Zeb's family name, Zeb responded that the youth should speak to Hera if he had any problems with the mission. Putting their plan into action, the rebels leapt onto the cargo ship's hull and made their way inside the ship. Zeb then sent Chopper to restart the ship's power plant. Shortly later, the rebels encountered the Ugnaught [[Melch]], who was one of Hondo's crew. Zeb forced Hondo to reveal the truth about his ill-fated initial mission to recover the ship's cargo; an operation which had cost the lives of Melch's comrades.<ref name="The Wynkahthu Job" />

While Zeb remained hostile and distrustful of Hondo, Ezra insisted that they could still work with him. Zeb and Ezra clashed again when the latter insisted on forcing his way into the cargo bay with his [[Ezra Bridger's second lightsaber|green lightsaber]]. Once inside, the recovery team found their treasures and proton bombs. Zeb then opened the outer cargo doors which allowed the ''Ghost'' to approach the cargo bay. Since the ''Ghost'' could not land, Zeb used grappling guns to fire magnetic cables which locked onto the ''Ghost''{{'s}} hull.<ref name="The Wynkahthu Job" />

Zeb and Ezra used the magnetic cables to ferry the proton bombs aboard the ''Ghost'', which Sabine stored them away. Under Zeb's orders, the proton bombs were loaded first and Hondo and Azmorigan were forced to wait. After Azmorigan disappeared, Zeb went to find him while giving Ezra instructions to continue loading the cargo. Zeb was then stunned by an [[Imperial sentry droid]], which took him to the brig. There, he discovered Hondo in a cell. Zeb managed to use his comlink to contact Ezra for help. Ezra and Chopper managed to rescue the two prisoners and they made their way back to the cargo bay.<ref name="The Wynkahthu Job" />

However, the recovery team encountered the sentry droid. Despite Zeb and AP-5's orders, Azmorigan shot and destroyed the sentry droid. However, this triggered the droid's comrades which pursued Zeb and his team back to the cargo bay. While Zeb and Ezra exchanged fire, Hondo and Azmorigan took the opportunity to flee aboard the ''Ghost''. Chopper quickly followed suit. Despite destroying one of the droids, the two rebels were forced to retreat as the ship began to list into the vortex. They used the magnetic cable system to reach the ''Ghost'' but almost fell into Wynkahthu's depths when the droids destroyed the grappling gun connecting it. Zeb and Ezra survived due to Kanan pulling them to safety.<ref name="The Wynkahthu Job" />

The rebels and their confederates managed to escape aboard the ''Ghost'' before a vortex ripped the cargo ship apart. Once aboard, Hera and Ezra thanked Zeb for his leadership. The rebels were pleased with their loot of proton bombs. However, Hondo was disappointed that Melch had snuck aboard one of his cargo chests and thrown out the treasures in the process. Having accomplished their objectives, the two groups then parted company.<ref name="The Wynkahthu Job" />

====Mission to the Lothal Imperial Factory====
[[File:Spectres discover TIE Defender.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|Zeb and his fellow rebels discuss the findings at the Lothal Imperial factory.]]
Zeb along with Hera, Sabine, and Commander Sato stayed behind at Chopper Base while Ezra, Kanan, and Chopper undertook a [[Infiltration of the Imperial Armory Complex|mission to infiltrate]] the [[Imperial Armory Complex]] on the planet Lothal. The Phoenix Squadron had discovered that the Empire was manufacturing a [[TIE/D Defender|new weapon]] there and were planning to destroy the factory. After Ezra and Kanan's local contact Ryder Azadi lost contact with the other Spectres, Azadi contacted the Phoenix Squadron via hologram. Zeb, Sabine, and Sato listened as Hera and Ryder discussed the new Imperial commander Grand Admiral Thrawn and Ryder's plan to launch a diversionary attack on the factory's east gate.<ref name="An Inside Man">{{Rebels|An Inside Man}}</ref>

After Ezra's team had managed to escape the factory with the weapon blue prints, Zeb along with Hera and Sabine corresponded with their comrades on Lothal by hologram. When Sabine expressed shock that their perennial foe Agent Kallus had helped Ezra's team to escape the factory, Zeb vouched for Kallus and remarked that he had accidentally recruited him on Bahryn. In response, Hera advised her comrades to treat Kallus with caution until they discovered what game he was playing.<ref name="An Inside Man" />

====The Spectre of Maul====
Following the raid on the Lothal Imperial factory, Zeb participated in a briefing organised by Sabine to discuss the upcoming rebel strike on the Imperial factory. During the briefing, Zeb and the other rebels noticed that Ezra was looking unwell. When Ezra saw Maul walking past Zeb, Ezra alerted him but Zeb saw nothing. When Ezra fainted, Zeb and Kanan attended to him. After Ezra recounted his vision of seeing Maul to the other Spectres, Zeb reported that he saw nothing beside him and thought that Ezra was working himself too hard. Later, Ezra and Kanan departed for [[Dathomir]] to [[Skirmish on Dathomir|deal]] with Maul.<ref name="Visions and Voices">{{Rebels|Visions and Voices}}</ref>

====Mission on Geonosis====
[[File:Deflector core.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|Zeb and Sabine sheltering under a deflector shield from battle droids.]]
At the request of Senator Bail Organa and [[Alliance High Command|Rebel Command]], Zeb and his fellow Spectres and Rex undertook a [[Mission to investigate Geonosis|mission]] to find [[Saw Gerrera]] and investigate the apparent disappearance of the [[Geonosian]] species. After landing on Geonosis, Zeb and Sabine were tasked by Hera finding the energy source that Saw had detected before losing contact with Rebel Command. Zeb and Sabine soon discovered an operational military grade deflector shield generator in the middle of the desert. Believing that Chopper Base could use the technology, Hera ordered Zeb and Sabine to extract the [[deflector core]]. When Zeb questioned what the shield generator was protecting, Sabine told him to work faster.<ref name="Ghosts">{{Rebels|Ghosts of Geonosis}}</ref>

Despite a sandstorm, the two rebels managed to extract the deflector core. Before they could return to the ''Ghost'', Sabine and Zeb discovered the presence of inactive droidekas. Zeb wanted to abandon the mission but Sabine convinced him to proceed. After the Geonosian [[Klik-Klak]], who was being pursued by the other Spectres and Saw, activated the droidekas, Sabine managed to use the deflector core to generate an energy field to protect the two of them. Zeb and Sabine held off long enough for Saw and the other Spectres to capture Klik-Klak and deactivate his remote controller.<ref name="Ghosts" />

Zeb and Sabine then brought the deflector core aboard the ''Ghost''. After Hera informed them about the arrival of an [[Brunson's Arquitens-class command cruiser|''Arquitens''-class command cruiser]], Zeb volunteered to enter the labyrinth on order to reestablish contact with Kanan and Rex's team. Zeb managed to reach the central air shaft and used a communication device to establish contact between the other Spectres and the ''Ghost''. After Kanan requested a pick-up, Zeb returned to the ''Ghost'' just in time to escape a strafing run by two [[TIE/sa bomber|TIE bombers]]. Once they were airborne, Zeb and Sabine took out the pursuing TIE bombers with the ''Ghost''{{'s}} cannons.<ref name="Ghosts" />

The ''Ghost'' then flew into the air shaft and picked up the other Spectres, Saw, and Klik-Klak. The rebels then became embroiled in argument over Saw's harsh interrogation methods and his plan to take Klik-Klak offworld for interrogation. The rebels and Saw then put aside their differences to repel Imperial [[Jumptrooper]]s from Captain [[Brunson]]'s light cruiser. Zeb exchanged fire with the Jumptroopers. After repelling the Imperial troops, the rebels took their ship into the depths of Geonosis. There they discovered poison canisters which confirmed that the Empire had perpetrated genocide against the Geonosians. After freeing Klik-Klak and the [[Karina the Great (Age of the Empire)|Geonosian queen egg]], the rebels blasted their way through the light cruiser. They escaped offworld with Saw, news of the Geonosian genocide, and a new deflector core.<ref name="Ghosts" />

====Guarding Chopper Base====
When the Phoenix rebels organized a training exercise, Zeb was upset that he had to stay behind as [[Chief of Security]] at Chopper Base. Zeb was unhappy at being left behind with Chopper and the inventory droid AP-5, whose company he did not enjoy. Unwilling to help AP-5 with inventory duties, Zeb departed for the base's command center. There, he was informed by a rebel officer that a sensor beacon in Sector 6 had been damaged by meteorites. Zeb and Chopper departed for Sector 6 to investigate the damaged beacon.<ref name="Warhead">{{Rebels|Warhead (episode)|Warhead}}</ref>

Upon arriving, the two discovered a seemingly damaged protocol droid lying among two dead krykna. Believing the droid to be a stray, Zeb took the protocol droid back to Chopper Base for repairs despite Chopper's protests. Unknown to Zeb and the others, the protocol droid was actually an [[E-XD infiltrator droid]] designated [[EXD-9]]. EXD-9 was part of a broad Imperial sweep of the Outer Rim Territories for rebel bases commissioned by Grand Admiral Thrawn, who hunting the rebellion down. After the recharged EXD-9 began scanning the the base depot, AP-5 hired the droid as his assistant. Zeb took a liking to EXD-9 after the protocol droid inadvertently made fun of Chopper.<ref name="Warhead" />

Later, Zeb received a warning from Fulcrum that the Empire was deploying Infiltrator droids to hunt down rebel bases and that one of these droids had lost contact with the Empire. After seeing the schematics, Zeb realized that EXD-9 was an Infiltrator droid. Returning to the depot, he managed to warn AP-5 and Chopper just before EXD-9 assumed his "attack mode" and attacked the rebels. EXD-9 managed to used his amplified height and fast movements to overpower Zeb and throw him to the ground. Following a fierce struggle, Zeb managed to sever the droid's left hand, forcing it to retreat.<ref name="Warhead" />

[[File:Warhead thumb.png|thumb|left|250px|Zeb fights off the Infiltrator Droid.]]
After discovering that EXD-9 had attacked and cannibalized another astromech droid, Zeb, Chopper and AP-5 resolved to join forces to prevent EXD-9 from alerting the Empire to Chopper Base. Their plan involved luring the Infiltrator droid out of hiding and AP-5 deactivating it. Putting their plan into action, Chopper lured EXD-9 out of hiding and Zeb ambushed the droid. The droid put up a fierce fight and hurled Zeb against the containers. Following a struggle, Zeb managed to subdue EXD-9 long enough for AP-5 to deactivate the droid. However, this triggered the droid's self-destruct mechanism but Chopper managed to freeze the timer before it could detonate a proton warhead.<ref name="Warhead" />

To prevent the Empire from discovering the location of Chopper Base and EXD-9 from destroying base, Zeb and his droid comrades came up with a plan to reprogram EXD-9 and send him back as a bomb to the Empire. AP-5 managed to reprogram EXD-9 back to his peaceful mode and set the proton warhead to detonate once it had logged back into the Imperial network. Zeb and his comrades then followed EXD-9 back to his pod. Zeb used his bo-rifle to shoot out EXD-9's long-range [[transmitter]], thus preventing EXD-9 from transmitting his report back to the Empire and forcing him to return to his base. When AP-5 expressed doubts that his work was successful, Zeb praised him for his work. In return, AP-5 commended Zeb for his "admirable" work.<ref name="Warhead" />

The following day, Zeb contacted Hera to tell her that they had an incident but had reasserted control. When the other rebels return, Zeb and his comrades attended a briefing at the command center where Fulcrum informed them that the reprogrammed Infiltrator droid had destroyed a Star Destroyer. When Sabine inquired about the details, Zeb responded that it was a long story. AP-5 proceeded to retell the story but Zeb playfully silenced his friend.<ref name="Warhead" />

====Sabine's trials====
Zeb and his fellow Spectres along with Fenn Rau attended a meeting where Fenn, Kanan, and Rau managed to convince a reluctant Sabine to take up the [[Darksaber]], an ancient Mandalorian weapon, in order to reunify the Mandalorians and rally them to the rebel cause.<ref name="Trials of the Darksaber">{{Rebels|Trials of the Darksaber}}</ref>

====Ferrying Mon Mothma====
Later, Zeb and his fellow Spectres undertook a mission at the request of Senator Bail Organa to rendezvous with another group of rebels in deep space. While waiting amidst starship wreckage, Zeb and the others listened to an Imperial [[HoloNet News]] broadcast by [[Alton Kastle]] about the former Senator Mon Mothma's alleged "[[treason]]" against the Empire for denouncing the [[Ghorman Massacre]]. The rebels then sighted a [[X3-13|tactical infiltration pod]], which Zeb and Chopper had encountered earlier on Atollon.<ref name="Secret Cargo" />

Zeb urged the others to destroy the pod while Hera tried to power down the systems in an attempt to evade detection. After the E-XD infiltrator droid piloting the pod spotted the ''Ghost'', Ezra managed to destroy the ship following a brief chase. However, they failed to stop the probe droid from alerting the Empire.<ref name="Secret Cargo" /> Shortly later, a rebel [[Taylander shuttle]] ''[[Chandrila Mistress]]''<ref name="Chandrila Mistress DB">{{Databank|chandrila-mistress|Chandrila Mistress|archivedate=20170504122521}}</ref> escorted by the Y-wing squadron [[Gold Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Gold Squadron]] emerged from hyperspace.<ref name="Secret Cargo" />

After the rebel ship docked with the ''Ghost'', Zeb and his fellow Spectres met Mothma's senatorial attache [[Erskin Semaj]] and [[Gold Leader]] Captain [[Jon Vander]]. The Spectres then proceeded to refuel Gold Squadron's Y-wings. Zeb and his fellow rebels chatted with the pilot [[Gold Two (rebellion)|Gold Two]]. When Zeb credited his rebel cell for destroying Grand Moff Tarkin's Star Destroyer ''Sovereign'', Gold Two chastised them for making it harder for other rebel groups to operate in the Outer Rim Territories. The argument between the Spectres and Mothma's rebels was interrupted by the arrival of an Imperial light cruiser and ''Gozanti'' cruiser.<ref name="Secret Cargo" />

After Gold Two was wounded, Zeb carried her to the ''Ghost''{{'s}} medbay while Ezra manned the pilot's Y-wing. During the ensuing gun battle, Zeb manned the ''Ghost''{{'s}} cannons and fought off several TIE fighters. The rebels managed to escape after Gold Squadron bombed the light cruiser. Mon Mothma and her crew were forced to flee the ''Chandrila Mistress'' and seek refuge aboard the ''Ghost''. After Hera introduced Zeb and his fellow rebels to Mon Mothma, the rebel leader personally thanked Zeb and Ezra. Zeb remained aboard the ''Ghost'' during the rebels' journey through the dangerous [[Archeon pass]] to [[Dantooine]].<ref name="Secret Cargo" />

[[File:Secret Cargo.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Zeb and other ''Ghost'' crew members helped Mon Mothma on her journey to Dantooine.]]
While traveling through the [[Archeon Nebula]], the rebels were pursued by an experimental TIE Defender and two [[TIE/IN interceptor|TIE Interceptors]]. During the [[Operation Handoff|dogfight]], Zeb manned the ''Ghost''{{'s}} rear turrets. He managed to shoot down one of the TIE Interceptors after the intense radiation of the Nebula caused the fighter's [[deflector shield]]s to overheat and break down. After exiting the Nebula, the ''Ghost'' was trapped by two Star Destroyers commanded by Governor Pryce and Admiral Konstantine. However, the rebels managed to flee into hyperspace after Ezra and Jon's Y-wings fired their [[proton torpedo]]es into the Archeon Nebula. Zeb and his fellow rebels were present when Mon Mothma gave a speech to the assembled [[Alliance Fleet|rebel fleet]], which became the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]].<ref name="Secret Cargo" />

===Alliance to Restore the Republic===
====Saving Chopper from himself====
Zeb and his fellow Spectres Hera and Ezra stayed aboard the ''Ghost'' while Chopper and AP-5 departed with Wedge Antilles on a [[Mission to recover Imperial codes|mission]] to steal clearance codes from the Imperial Security Bureau's [[Killun Station|base]] on [[Killun 71]]. Zeb joked about the cantankerous Chopper and grumpy AP-5 being difficult co-pilots for Wedge. Hera however reassured them that the droids and Wedge were the right team. While AP-5 succeeded in stealing the clearance codes without incident, Chopper was hijacked by a team of Imperial listeners aboard a ''Gozanti''-class cruiser, who reprogrammed him into a double agent [[spy]] droid. The Imperial controller [[LT-319]] wanted to use Chopper to find the location of Chopper Base.<ref name="DAD">{{Rebels|Double Agent Droid}}</ref>

Zeb and Ezra were playing a game of [[dejarik]] when AP-5 and Wedge returned to the ''Ghost''. While Zeb and Ezra dismissed AP-5's warning about Chopper's suspicious behavior, Hera believed AP-5 and narrowly prevented Chopper from downloading the ''Ghost''{{'s}} hyperspace logs. After Chopper headed to the engine room and caused the ''Ghost'' to exit hyperspace, Zeb followed the other rebels into the engine room to confront the rogue droid. However, Chopper locked them in the cargo hold and exposed them to zero gravity space. The rebels narrowly avoided being sucked into space due to Hera's quick thinking. After AP-5 managed to climb outside and unlock the cargo bay from outside, Zeb and the other rebels returned to the cockpit.<ref name="DAD" />

Zeb personally stunned Chopper with his bo-rifle and remarked that he wanted to do it for a long time. However, Hera told him to be gentle with her droid and get him in an upright position. After plugging him back into the ship's systems, Hera used Chopper's visual processor to send a message to the Imperial listeners. She then used Chopper to transmit a large amount of data including his Imperial programming back to the Imperial cruiser. This data overload destroyed the ''Gozanti''-cruiser but caused Chopper to convulse. After Chopper was motionless, Zeb and Ezra were visibly sad despite disliking the droid. However, the two rebels joined Hera in celebrating the return of their comrade after Chopper rebooted to his former programming. Zeb and the other rebels were later present when they picked up AP-5 from space and watched it argue with an apologetic Chopper.<ref name="DAD" />

====Maul's last stand====
Zeb was sleeping in the bunk below Ezra's bed when the young Jedi was awakened by Kanan's Jedi holocron, which began playing back a hologram recording of Jedi Master [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]'s warning for the Jedi about the [[Jedi Purge]]. This turned out to be a ruse by the former Sith apprentice Maul to lure Ezra to [[Tatooine]] in order to draw Kenobi out of hiding. Ezra and Chopper subsequently encountered Kenobi during an [[Mission to Tatooine (Imperial Era)|errant mission]] to Tatooine, which saw the death of Maul. When Ezra and Chopper returned in Maul's ship ''[[Nightbrother (Gauntlet fighter)|Nightbrother]]'', Zeb was loading cargo. When Zeb asked Ezra whether or not "this means what I want it to mean," Ezra reassured Zeb along with Kanan and Hera that this would be the last time they would be seeing Maul again. Ezra then apologized for running away and stressed that the Spectres were his family.<ref name="Twin Suns">{{Rebels|Twin Suns (episode)|Twin Suns}}</ref>

====Battle of Atollon====
Zeb took part in the [[Battle of Atollon]]. Before the Phoenix Squadron and [[General]] [[Jan Dodonna]]'s [[Massassi Group]] could launch their strike on Lothal, Grand Admiral Thrawn's [[Seventh Fleet]] exited hyperspace and blockaded Atollon. In response, Hera devised a plan for the rebels to attack the fleet so that Ezra and Chopper could escape offworld aboard Maul's former ship ''Nightbrother''. As the rebels mustered to fight Thrawn's forces, Zeb asked his friend Rex if he had any regrets about joining the rebellion. Rex responded that it was better than hunting joopas. During the first phase, Zeb and Rex manned the guns aboard the ''Ghost'' while Hera flew the ship.<ref name="Zero Hour">{{Rebels|Zero Hour}}</ref>

Despite sustaining heavy losses, the rebels managed to facilitate Ezra and Chopper's escape. Commander Sato sacrificed his life and flagship ''Phoenix Nest'' by ramming Admiral Konstantine's [[interdictor vessel]], giving a window for Ezra's [[Kom'rk-class fighter|Gauntlet fighter]] to flee into hyperspace. Having accomplished their mission, the rebels retreated back to Chopper Base to prepare for Thrawn's ground assault. Zeb and Rex joined forces to activate Sabine's prototype deflector shield generator, which provided an umbrella for the surviving rebel ships and forces.<ref name="Zero Hour" />

[[File:Capt. Rex, Zeb vs AT-ATs.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|Zeb sees the AT-AT walkers approaching.]]
After the shield withstood Thrawn's assault, Zeb and Rex ambushed several Imperial AT-DP walkers that were traveling through the narrow canyon which led to Chopper Base. After Rex destroyed most of the walkers with detonators, Zeb destroyed the last one with a rocket launcher. However, the two were forced to flee when Thrawn deployed several AT-AT walkers, which were protected by deflector shields. After reuniting with Kanan, the rebels played cat and mouse with Thrawn's [[death trooper]]s in the tunnels under the [[Atollon Coral Mesa]].<ref name="Zero Hour" />

Zeb and Rex eventually reunited with Hera, General Dodonna, and the other rebels back at Chopper Base. Before they could flee aboard the ''Ghost'', they were surrounded by Thrawn and his death troopers. Before Thrawn could kill them, Kanan's mysterious friend known as [[Bendu]], a powerful Force-wielder, attacked the base with a lightning storm. The rebels took the opportunity to flee offworld. By that stage, Ezra had brought [[Clan Wren]] Mandalorian reinforcements led by Sabine who succeeded in destroying Thrawn's second interdictor cruiser. This gave the remaining rebel forces the window they needed to flee into hyperspace to [[Yavin 4]].<ref name="Zero Hour" />

====Yavin 4====
After their defeat at Atollon, Sabine took Ezra, Chopper and Kanan to Mandalore to assist the battle,<ref name="Heroes of Mandalore">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Heroes of Mandalore]]''</ref> while Zeb, Hera, Rex and the rest of the surviving Rebels went to Yavin 4. Upon the their victory on Mandalore, the four go to Yavin 4, where they are greeted by Zeb. Excited to once again see their comrade, they began to joke and jest with him.<ref name="In the Name of the Rebellion" />

[[File:In the Name - Rebels Arrive on Yavin 4.png|thumb|right|220x220px|Following their recent battle on Mandalore Zeb greets his fellow Spectres on Yavin 4.]]
Kanan asked where Hera was and Zeb had told him on a supply mission. He also told them that Yavin 4 was the hub for the several Rebels cells that had banded together, including the remaining members of Phoenix Squadron. Moments later, Hera and her squadron came crashing into the base, miraculously being able to survive. Zeb and the other Spectres rushed to check if she was alright. After a brief reunion with her team, Kallus noted how touching it was, but that Mon Mothma requested their presence.<ref name="In the Name of the Rebellion" />

====Mission on Jalindi====
Zeb would join in the briefing, explaining the details for the Empire's new [[Jalindi relay|relay station]] on the planet [[Jalindi]]. The Spectres volunteered for the mission, which was to tap in to the Empire's communications and that they were not to destroy it. On the planet, Ezra, Sabine and Chopper fly down to the relay dish, attempting to be of stealth. Zeb expressed his disdain and worry with their means of reaching the dish, but Kanan reminded him that they needed to free-fall to reach the dish without being discovered. Moments later, as the three begin to work on the dish, Zeb informed Kanan and Hera of an Imperial light cruiser, the ''[[Marauder]]'', entering the system. As the ship drew nearer, Zeb reported two TIE Defenders flying towards them. Hera then ordered Zeb to take the turret position. Kanan encouraged Hera to fly below in the fog, so that he could guide them through, as it would interfere with their systems. Zeb attempts to shoot the Defenders, but with their shielding, his shots did little.<ref name="In the Name of the Rebellion" />

Zeb, realizing that they were flying in fog, questioned what they were doing. Eventually realizing the plan, once a Defender crashed into a pillar, Zeb began to focus fire on the second Defender, eventually destroying it. Meanwhile, a U-Wing under the command of Saw Gerrera and [[Edrio]] came to destroy the relay station, picking up Ezra, Sabine and Chopper. Angered, Hera attempted to get her team back, but a Star Destroyer entered the system, forcing Saw to jump into hyperspace. Sabine, Ezra and Chopper returned to the crew, after assisting Saw in a mission and winning several technicians for the Rebellion.<ref name="In the Name of the Rebellion" />

====Returning to Lothal====
After their first failed attempt to aid Lothal, which resulted in the Battle of Atollon, the Rebels began to plan their second attempt. They devised a plan, which involved a deep cover, even using the ship, the ''[[Broken Horn]]'', for transport rather than the ''Ghost''. The two ships interlocked so they could load their supplies onto the ''Broken Horn''. Rex inquired why Zeb was not assisting with loading the supplies, which included puffer pigs. Zeb responded saying that he scared the creatures too much. Rex joked with him about him being unique, which Zeb in turn asked if that was clone humor. To make the cover work, the Spectres, Zeb included, bore new outfits to disguise their identities. Chopper entered the bridge, making fun of Zeb and Ezra's hats. Upon landing at [[Jhothal]], Zeb was ordered to scare the puffer pigs, to rescue Vizago from the Imperials.<ref name="The Occupation">{{Rebels|The Occupation}}</ref>

After his rescue, Hera ordered that they split up, having Sabine, Ezra and Chopper go to Jho's cantina, while she, Kanan and Zeb searched for transport. Zeb was able to locate transport, noting that it was "convenient". Zeb, however, did have to attack some stormtroopers. After rendezvousing with the rest of the team, plus Jai Kell, they went into the empty cantina, with Zeb smashing the controls. The group once again split up, Zeb and his unit were pursued by a probe droid, followed by two others. Eventually, Zeb and his team reunited and made it to the surface, where they were met by Ryder in a U-Wing, co-piloted by [[Marida Sumar]], which led to the Rebels escape.<ref name="The Occupation" />

====The TIE/D Defender Elite Heist====
Later, Zeb, Ezra, Sabine, and Ryder Azadi stalked an [[Lothal Imperial airfield|Imperial research facility]] in Lothal's wilderness. Zeb was initially skeptical of the [[TIE/D Defender Elite]]'s until he saw the fighter for himself. Zeb and Ryder waited among the grass while Ezra and Sabine infiltrated the facility. Before Commander [[Vult Skerris]] could fly the prototype, Ezra and Sabine stole the fighter and fled. While Ezra and Sabine tangled with Imperial fighters, Zeb and Ryder rejoined Kanan and Hera at Ryder's U-wing. When Zeb grumbled that he knew that the "kids" would pull off "something crazy", Kanan told him not to worry and departed with Hera to find the two Spectres. Kanan and Hera later found Ezra and Sabine with the stolen [[flight data recorder]].<ref name="Flight of the Defender">{{Rebels|Flight of the Defender}}</ref>

The following day, Zeb along with Ezra and Jai Kell, who were disguised as scout troopers, returned to the TIE Defender Elite crash site to retrieve the ship's hyperdrive unit. Sabine believed that the TIE Defender Elite's hyperdrive could be fitted on Ryder's U-wing to provide the rebels with an escape transport. While Zeb waited on a speeder bike, Ezra and Kell searched the rocks. They managed to find the hyperdrive with the help of a [[loth-cat]]. Shortly later, Ezra and Kell were accosted by the [[Noghri]] tracker [[Rukh]], who had been sent by Thrawn to hunt the rebels. While Ezra and Kell fled on a speeder bike, Zeb stayed behind the hyperdrive and managed to avoid an Imperial search party led by Governor Pryce. Zeb managed to hijack their Imperial Troop Transport and escaped with the hyperdrive. He reached the [[Lothal resistance camp]].<ref name="Kindred">{{Rebels|Kindred}}</ref>

Zeb's rebel comrades initially mistook him for a hostile but were mollified when Zeb stepped out of the vehicle with the hyperdrive. This enabled Sabine to install the hyperdrive on the U-wing. After Hera and Chopper departed Lothal on the U-wing with the stolen flight data recorder, Zeb and the other rebels encountered a pack of [[loth-wolf|loth-wolves]], which led them into a network of underground caves and tunnels. These tunnels brought them into Lothal's southern hemisphere.<ref name="Kindred" />

====Commandeering the ore crawler====
After the Spectres and Ryder set up base in the [[Lothal cliff dwelling|caves]] they had recently discovered, Zeb and his comrades wandered Lothal's plains where they encountered the Mining Guild [[ore crawler]] [[Crawler 413-24]], which was stripping Lothal's surface for minerals. At the urging of Zeb, the rebels managed to board the ore crawler and take out a [[IG-RM bodyguard and enforcer droid|security droid]]. After Ryder had used his speeder to transport the rebels aboard the crawler, Zeb and his comrades then penetrated the cockpit where they overpowered the [[Trandoshan]] Mining Guild captain [[Seevor]]. However, they were unable to stop him from sending a distress signal. After knocking Seevor out, Zeb and Kanan entered the processing chamber. While Zeb searched the upper deck, Kanan search the lower deck.<ref name="Crawler Commandeers">{{Rebels|Crawler Commandeers}}</ref>

The two encountered several indentured prisoners including Vizago, who had been imprisoned for smuggling the Spectres into Lothal. Kanan was then attacked by the Trandoshan foreman [[Proach]], who wielded an [[electro-whip]]. Proach managed to disarm Kanan of his lightsaber. Zeb rushed to Kanan's rescue and pointed his bo-rifle at the foreman. The foreman retreated to the upper deck using his electro-whip and fought Zeb. Zeb was unable to strike the Trandoshan with his bo-rifle. As the two squared off at a narrow catwalk, Proach tried to throw Zeb off but the Lasat used his prehensile feet to pull his opponent over, leaving the two dangling over the guardrail. Despite Proach tightening his laser-whip around the Lasat's forearm, Zeb managed to shake off his opponent. Proach fell to his death and the rebels were able to liberate the prisoners.<ref name="Crawler Commandeers" />

When an Imperial patrol arrived to investigate Seevor's distress transmission, Zeb helped the other rebels and liberated prisoners to maintain a ruse. Zeb used Proach's helmet and laser-whip to disguise himself as a foreman while Vizago plied the Imperial troops with smooth-talk. Though the Imperials left, Seevor managed to escape and shut down the crawler's reactor. Ezra pursued Seevor and killed the Trandoshan following a struggle. Following the death of Seevor, the freed prisoners agreed to join the Rebellion with Vizago taking control of the crawler. The Spectres then received news from Hera that Rebel Command had authorized a [[Attack on Lothal|strike]] against the Imperial factories on Lothal. Zeb and the other rebels were designated as part of the ground support team.<ref name="Crawler Commandeers" />

====Strike on Lothal====
As part of the Rebel Alliance's ground support team on Lothal, Zeb and his fellow Spectres Kanan, Ezra, and Sabine planted explosives on the air defense batteries stationed outside the Imperial Armored Complex on Lothal. When Zeb asked Sabine if the explosives were powerful enough, she assured him it would. In response, Zeb remarked that the towers looked larger closer up. After planting their explosives, the rebels retreated on speeder bikes. When Ezra told him to hop on, Zeb hauled the youth to the backseat and insisted on driving the bike. Despite their success in taking out the air defenses, Thrawn's fleet wiped out Hera's [[T-65B X-wing starfighter]] squadron, forcing the rebels to abort their mission and retreat.<ref name="Rebel Assault">{{Rebels|Rebel Assault}}</ref>

After regrouping with the Lothal resistance in Lothal's wilderness, Zeb helped Ezra and the others build [[Loth-bat glider]]s at Ezra's old [[LothalNet comm tower E-272|hideout]] in order to rescue Hera. After they were built, Zeb and Chopper then used a speeder bike to tow the gliders. Zeb then told the others to bring Hera Back.<ref name="Jedi Night">{{Rebels|Jedi Night}}</ref>

====Avenging Kanan====
{{Quote|This...is...for...Kanan!|Garazeb Orrelios to Rukh|DUME}}
After the other Spectres returned from their [[Rescue of Hera Syndulla|rescue mission]], Zeb and Chopper learned that Kanan had perished during the mission. Grief-stricken, he and Sabine decided to avenge Kanan's death by sabotaging Pryce's parade for the Empire's "victory" over the Rebels. Zeb and Sabine departed the rebel camp on speeder bikes. Upon reaching the outskirts of Capital City, Zeb and Sabine scanned the horizon with [[macrobinoculars]]. Zeb also knocked out a scout troop. After using the scout trooper's speeder bike to link to the Imperial network on Lothal, Zeb and Sabine discovered that Governor Pryce was holding the parade to hide the fact that the destruction of the [[Lothal City fuel depot]] had destroyed the Empire's fuel supply and knocked out the TIE Defender factory on Lothal. As a result, the two realized that Kanan had not died for nothing.<ref name="DUME">{{Rebels|DUME}}</ref>

With the Noghri tracker Rukh hot on their trail, Zeb and Sabine lured him into a trap on Lothal's open plains. Despite outnumbering Rukh, the Noghri was equipped with a cloaking [[Sinrich optical dephaser|device]] and managed to fight off the two rebels. Following a fierce fight, Sabine was able to expose Rukh by detonating a [[paint bomb]] on him. This allowed Zeb to knock Rukh out. Overcome by rage, Zeb began bashing Rukh but was stopped from killing him by Sabine. After Sabine painted Rukh, Zeb sent him back to Capital City.<ref name="DUME" />

A reinvigorated Zeb and Sabine then returned to the rebel camp and informed Hera, Chopper, and Ezra that their mission to take out the TIE Defender factory on Lothal had succeeded. By then, Hera and Ezra had made peace with Kanan's death as well. The rebels then departed on a mission to save the Lothal Jedi Temple from the Empire.<ref name="DUME" />

====Mission to Lothal's Jedi Temple====
Zeb, despite his skepticism, traveled with the other Spectres to Lothal's Jedi Temple. Zeb and the Spectres were then taken to the Temple by [[Dume (Loth-wolf)|Dume]] and his fellow Loth-wolves, which were capable of generating [[hyper tunnel]]s. Upon their arrival at the temple, the Spectres discovered that the Empire and Mining Guild had set up an [[Excavation of the Lothal Jedi Temple|excavation camp]]. To investigate what the Empire was doing to the Lothal Jedi Temple, Ezr and Sabine decided to [[Mission to the Lothal Jedi Temple|infiltrate]] the excavation camp.<ref name="Wolves and a Door">{{Rebels|Wolves and a Door}}</ref>

To aid the mission, Zeb knocked out a pair of scout troopers, which allowed Ezra and Sabine to steal their armor. While Ezra and Sabine infiltrated the excavation camp, Zeb along with Hera and Chopper kept watch outside the camp. While surveying the camp, Zeb spotted an an old man, who turned out to be the Imperial Minister [[Veris Hydan]]. Zeb then saw Ezra open a [[portal]] to a gateway. After Ezra and Sabine informed them that the Emperor was interested in the Lothal Jedi Temple, Zeb convinced Hera to remember the purpose of their mission.<ref name="Wolves and a Door" />

Using the [[Lothal Jedi Temple key stone]] as a guide, Ezra and Sabine attempted to unlock the [[Painting of the Mortis gods]]. Though Sabine was detained by stormtrooper sentries, Ezra managed to unlock the painting. Zeb and Hera witnessed these developments and wondered if Sabine had been discovered by the Imperials. When Hera remarked that Ezra had move to the shadows, Zeb was initially disbelieving and took over the macrobinoculars. After Minister Hydan discovered Sabine's presence and raised the alarm, Zeb and the other rebels retreated from the Temple.<ref name="Wolves and a Door" />

After retreating to a safe distance, Zeb, Hera, and Chopper continued to watch the Temple. They did not know if Ezra had escaped capture; Ezra had in fact entered a portal which led to the [[World between worlds]]. Knowing that the Imperials had taken Sabine prisoner, Zeb and his rebel comrades decided to infiltrate the camp. After leaving Chopper to guard the painting where Ezra had disappeared into, Zeb and Hera headed towards the building on the far side of the camp where Sabine had been taken to; the [[mobile command center]] where Minister Hydan was interrogating Sabine about her knowledge of the portal.<ref name="AWBW">{{Rebels|A World Between Worlds}}</ref>

As part of their rescue plan, Hera decided to detonate one of the thrusters beneath Hydan's mobile command center. On Hera's instruction, Zeb signaled Sabine by knocking on the hull of the mobile command center. This caused the structure to tilt upwards and crash on several crates. Zeb, Hera, and Sabine took the opportunity to escape but were pursued by several stormtroopers and death troopers. Zeb knocked out a stormtrooper in the process. Heading towards the portal, the Spectres encountered Ezra, who had barely escaped the Emperor's clutches. Ezra convinced Zeb and Sabine to help them seal the portal to prevent the Empire from accessing the World between worlds.<ref name="AWBW" />

After locking back the portal, Zeb carried an unconscious Ezra and the rebels escaped aboard a stolen [[Mining Guild excavation driller]] as the Jedi Temple sunk into the ground around them. Following their mission, Zeb complimented Ezra by telling him that "if that was what he and Kanan used to do on previous missions", he could keep him.<ref name="AWBW" />

====Trapping Governor Pryce====
Following the events at the Lothal Jedi Temple, Zeb along with the other Spectres and Ryder Azadi's [[Lothal resistance]], participated in Ezra's plan to lure Governor Pryce into a trap at the Lothal cliff dwelling. Capturing Pryce was key to Ezra's plan to [[Liberation of Lothal|liberate]] Lothal from Imperial rule. This plan involved using Ryder Azadi to lure Pryce and her forces to the rebel base by pretending to betray the rebels.<ref name="A Fool's Hope">{{Rebels|A Fool's Hope}}</ref>

During the assault on the Lothal rebels' cliff base, Zeb used his mortar to fire upon Imperial patrol transports and stormtroopers. When his mortar ran out of juice, Zeb tossed it at the troopers. Outnumbered, Zeb and the remaining rebels retreated to a defensive position on the Mining guild ore crawler. When Governor Pryce bombarded the ore crawler, Zeb, Ezra, and the other Spectres managed to escape the wreckage but were taken prisoner by Pryce's forces.<ref name="A Fool's Hope" />

However, Governor Pryce's forces were then attacked by Hera Syndulla's reinforcements including Rex, Kallus, and the [[Clone commando]]s Gregor and Wolffe. While the ''Ghost'' took out Pryce's patrol transport, the remaining Imperial troops were overwhelmed by a pack of loth-wolves. Zeb took several surrendering stormtroopers prisoner and witnessed the [[White Loth-wolf|white loth-wolf]] deliver a captive Pryce, Ryder, Rex, and Kallus.<ref name="A Fool's Hope" />

====Liberating Lothal====
=====Storming the Dome=====
The second stage of Ezra's plan to liberate Lothal involved infiltrating Capital City and seizing control of the [[Imperial Complex (Lothal)|"Dome"]], which turned out to be a mobile [[Imperial Planetary Occupation Facility]]. Zeb, posing as a prisoner, traveled to the Imperial Complex with Ezra, Sabine, Kallus, and their prisoner Pryce aboard a patrol transport. After landing, Zeb attacked the stormtroopers and held the blast door open long enough for him, Sabine, and Ketsu to get in.<ref name="Farewell Reunion & Farewell" />

Inside the complex, Zeb and his fellow rebels fought their way into the Dome's command center, shooting down several stormtroopers during the ensuing gun battle. To distract the Imperial officers inside the command center, Zeb and Hondo tossed Melch onto the [[transparisteel]] canopy of the command center. This distraction enabled Ezra and the other rebels to enter the command center and force the Imperial officers' surrender.<ref name="Farewell Reunion & Farewell" />

Having secured the Dome, the rebels initiated [[Protocol 13]], a planetwide evacuation of all Imperial forces on Lothal. Though this plan worked, the rebels were not able to start the Dome's engines and lift-off before the return of Grand Admiral Thrawn's flagship ''[[Chimaera]]''. Since Thrawn's Noghri assassin Rukh had disabled the Dome's deflector shields, Thrawn was able to bombard Capital City, destroying several buildings and inflicting casualties on the civilian population. In order to stop the bombardment, Ezra offered to come aboard the ''Chimaera'' to surrender.<ref name="Family Reunion & Farewell">{{Rebels|Family Reunion – and Farewell}}</ref>

=====Restoring the shields=====
While the rebels discussed their next response, Zeb suggested that they use the Dome's cannons against the ''Chimaera'' but Rex told they would not be strong enough against the ''Chimaera''. Sabine proposed that the rebel's study the base schematics to find a way to raise the shields and take control of the power terminals. After Ezra departed to confront Thrawn, the rebels adopted Sabine's plan.<ref name="Family Reunion & Farewell" />

When Imperial reinforcements attempted to retake the command center, Zeb helped Hondo and Melch ambush and drive away the attack party. Putting Sabine's plan into action, Zeb along with Kalus and Gregor were organized into Team B, which was tasked with going to the Dome's south tower to reactivate the city's shields. There, they were attacked by Ruhk and several death troopers.<ref name="Family Reunion & Farewell" />

During the skirmish, Zeb fought with Rukh while navigating through the power conduits of the north tower. Zeb managed to trap Rukh's leg between two metal bars on a conduit. When the shields turned on, Zeb watched as Rukh was electrocuted to death. When Thrawn tried to contact Rukh on his comlink, Zeb mockingly told Thrawn that Ruhk was unavailable and that he shouldn't bother calling back while Rukh screamed in the background.<ref name="Family Reunion & Farewell" />

When the ''Chimaera'' was taken into hyperspace by a pod of purrgil, Zeb and the rest of the rebel forces then escaped from the Dome aboard the ''Ghost'', which was being flown by Wolffe, Mart Mattin, and Cikatro Vizago. After escaping the Dome, Sabine triggered its self-destruct mechanism. Following the Liberation of Lothal, the Spectres considered finding Ezra. However, they received a pre-recorded transmission from Ezra that was played by Chopper. In that message, Zeb was given the top bunk in their cabin.<ref name="Family Reunion & Farewell" />

Following the Liberation of Lothal, Zeb also said that they didn't need the Rebel Alliance due to their victory. Despite the rebels' expectations, the Empire did not return to Lothal.<ref name="Family Reunion & Farewell" />

===Galactic Civil War===
[[File:Rebel council.jpg|thumb|left|220x220px|As a veteran rebel Zeb would take part in many functions council meetings to field command.]]
In [[0 BBY]],<ref name="Galactic Atlas">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]''</ref> the [[Galactic Civil War]] broke out with the [[Battle of Scarif]].<ref name="Rogue One">''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''</ref> By [[1 ABY]], Orrelios had become a member of the Alliance High Command and attended a meeting of the High Command at the [[Mako-Ta Space Docks|Mako-Ta Base]] along with Hera Syndulla.<ref name="Star Wars 45" />

===Later years===
{{Quote|After the war, Zeb took Kallus along the secret hyperspace path to the planet Lira San. It was then that Kallus realized he hadn't destroyed the Lasat people, and that they were thriving on this new world. A world where he was welcomed as one of them.|Sabine Wren|Family Reunion – and Farewell}}
[[File:Kallus & Zeb @ Lira San.jpeg|thumb|right|267x267px|Zeb shows Kallus that he did not extinguish the entire Lasat race.]]
After the Alliance's decisive victory at the [[Battle of Endor|battle]] of [[Endor]] that saw the death of [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] Palpatine, Orrelios took Kallus aboard a [[EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate|Nebulon-B2 frigate]]. Together, they went to Lira San to show Kallus that he did not extinguish the entire Lasat race.<ref name="Family Reunion & Farewell" />

==Personality and traits==
[[File:ZebOrrelios2-Fathead.png|thumb|left|200px|Zeb Orrelios, ready for combat.]]
Haunted by his people's near extermination, Garazeb Orrelios adopted a gruff and agitated persona, quick to fits of rage and violence. Behind this outward guise Zeb was actually a compassionate being who cared a great deal for his fellow members of the ''Ghost'', and for people affected negatively by the Empire. Zeb had a strong sense of morality, and he implored Kanan not to sell disruptor rifles to Cikatro Vizago in order to make some money.<ref name="Droids in Distress" /> However, he kept his Honor Guard medallion and a tiny bag of Lasan dust in his quarters to remind him of his home.<ref name="SW:AEYNTK" />He often vented his disgust for the Empire by beating up stormtroopers, an act he relished. He used his considerable combat skills to defend helpless citizens oppressed by the Empire, and even declined money offered to him for doing so.<ref name="Rise of the Rebels">''[[Rise of the Rebels]]''</ref> He often expressed his frustration by exclaiming "[[Karabast]]!"<ref name="Spark Trivia">{{SW|url=tv-shows/spark-of-rebellion-trivia-gallery|text="Spark of Rebellion" Trivia Gallery}}</ref>

Despite his essentially good heart, Zeb was quick to anger and rash actions which often got him into trouble. Agent Kallus easily goaded him into risking his life needlessly by taunting him about his people's genocide.<ref name="Droids in Distress" /> Zeb tried to appear stoic and serious minded but also had a good dry sense of humor and occasionally showed a more childish side. His skills were an asset to the crew, but his impulsiveness occasionally caused trouble. He once bet Chopper in a game of Sabacc and lost much to his surprise. Ezra and Chopper dragged him into their childish antics on a number of occasions.<ref name="Idiot's Array" />

Hera had a maternal relationship towards Zeb, as she did with most of the crew, and Zeb had the utmost respect for her and rarely questioned her instructions, referring to her as the "sane one" of the crew. He reluctantly developed a brotherly bond with Ezra after initially reacting very hostile toward him, even physically threatening him on numerous occasions.<ref name="Fighter Flight" /> After being forced to leave Ezra behind after a botched rescue attempt, he felt a great deal of guilt until the boy's return. He particularly despised the crew's droid Chopper, who he saw as useless in all practical situations and little more than a nuisance and liability to the crew.<ref name="Spark of Rebellion" /> Gradually he came to accept the droid's eccentricity and expressed genuine surprise and gratitude when Chopper saved the crew.<ref name="Idiot's Array" /> Still, this did not stop Zeb from teasing Chopper on one occasion about his mismatched ambulatory strut.<ref name="The Forgotten Droid" /> Despite their tense relationship, Zeb still respected Chopper sufficiently to come to his aid during a [[Skirmish aboard a Republic medical station|fraught mission]] to recover medical supplies from an abandoned space station.<ref name="Always Two There Are" />

Due to his experiences during the Siege of Lasan, Zeb believed that he had failed to protect his people and the Lasan royal family. His guilt and shame led him to hide the fact that he had once been a Captain in the Lasan High Honor Guard from even his fellow rebels. Zeb was also skeptical of the supernatural and initially believed that the Lasat refuge of Lira San was a myth. Zeb was able to overcome his past guilt by fulfilling an ancient Lasat prophecy which involved him fulfilling three different roles: the "Child", the "Fool", and the "Warrior." In the process, Zeb made a leap of faith by letting the Force guide his bo-rifle to Lira San.<ref name="Legends of the Lasat" />

Zeb showed ingenuity when he used a stolen Imperial Troop Transport to ferry a stolen hyperdrive back to his rebel comrades.<ref name="Kindred" /> Later, Zeb showed initiative when he convinced his rebel comrades to board a Mining Guild ore crawler.<ref name="Crawler Commandeers" />
[[File:Zeb Orrelios AWH.png|thumb|right|278px|Even before he was a rebel Zeb was always ready for a fight from his days as an honor guard of Lasan.]]
While a ferocious fighter, Zeb still valued honor and refused to fight a wounded opponent. Despite his antagonistic relationship with the Imperial Security Bureau Agent Kallus, Zeb was still able to develop an unlikely friendship with him during a mission to Geonosis. He realized that Kallus was not the monster that he had grown to hate and that the Imperial agent also valued honor. Zeb's warmth towards Kallus was also helped by the two nominal adversaries teaming up to survive the cold and several bonzami monsters while stranded on the ice moon of Bahryn Zeb's encounter with Kallus made him realize that not all Imperials were evil.<ref name="The Honorable Ones" />

Despite his valor, Zeb hated [[insect]]s,<ref name="ATTS">{{SWRMCite||A Time to Survive}}</ref> and had a fear of the large krykna creatures that inhabited Atollon.<ref name="Mystery" /> In missions, Zeb was a team player who accepted his leader's instructions. After Ezra's recon mission on Reklam Station when awry, Zeb offered to shoulder the responsibility until Hera clarified that it was Ezra's responsibility.<ref name="Steps" /> Zeb regarded the Iron Squadron as a naive bunch of "Ezra"-like wannabees who did not understand what they were fighting against.<ref name="Iron Squadron" />

Zeb had a low opinion of the pirate Hondo Ohnaka due to his slippery and double-dealing nature. He distrusted the pirate and regarded Hondo as a liar after learning that Hondo had omitted certain facts during a recovery mission on the planet Wynkahthu: that he had lost most of his Ugnaught crew during an earlier recovery attempt. Zeb's contempt for Ohnaka was best reflected when he threatened to rip off the Weequay's arms and insisted that the rebels' cargo of proton bombs precede Hondo and his companion Azmorigan's treasure. Despite his dislike for Azmorigan, Zeb's concern for his team's well-being led him to search for the [[Jablogian]]. When Ezra questioned his leadership of the mission, Zeb insisted that it was his turn since Ezra had led previous missions. Despite his leadership role, Zeb still deferred to Captain Syndulla.<ref name="The Wynkahthu Job" />

As a warrior, Zeb was initially disappointed when he was unable to attend a training exercise because Captain Syndulla needed someone to guard Chopper Base. While Zeb was annoyed by AP-5's jokes about him and the inventory droid's fastidious attention to detail, he still respected AP-5's ingenious plan to reprogram a captured E-XD infiltrator droid as a time bomb against the Empire. By working with Chopper and AP-5 to defeat the Infiltrator Droid EXD-9, Zeb and AP-5 gained a better sense of respect for each. Zeb admired AP-5's wit and ingenuity while AP-5 came to admire his martial prowess and abilities.<ref name="Warhead" /> Zeb was also known for his good sense of humor during difficult times such as the Battle of Atollon. He and Rex joked about hunting joopas.<ref name="Zero Hour" />

Zeb was overcome by grief and rage following the death of Kanan during a mission to rescue Hera. Seeking revenge against the Empire, he and Sabine decided to sabotage the Imperial victory parade. Zeb and Sabine subsequently discovered that Kanan's death had not been in vain because the explosion that claimed his life dealt a severe blow to Imperial military production on Lothal. Zeb almost killed the Noghri tracker Rukh but relented at the urging of Sabine, who spared his life but spray-painted the Imperial tracker.<ref name="DUME" /> While Zeb was initially skeptical about the Spectres' mission to save the Lothal Jedi Temple, he insisted that they continue with their mission despite learning that the Emperor was interested in the excavation site.<ref name="Wolves and a Door" />

Zeb was able to work as a team with his rebel comrades during an operation to trap Governor Pryce<ref name="A Fool's Hope" /> and an assault on the "Dome" during the Liberation of Lothal.
Zeb's hatred of the Empire and Rukh led him to laugh as Rukh was electrocuted to death after the shields at the Dome were restored. Following the Battle of Endor, Zeb's friendship with his former foe Kallus led them to travel together to Lira San, the original homeworld of the Lasat people where the species still thrived.<ref name="Family Reunion & Farewell" />

==Skills and abilities==
[[File:Zeb using bo-rifle.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A former captain of the Lasan High Honor Guard, Orrelios was skilled with a bo-rifle.]]
As a Lasat, Zeb possessed strength, agility, and reflexes superior to any human, being able to ragdoll many stormtroopers, perform astounding jumps and leaps, move the "Ghost"s dorsal turret from outside the ship with his bare hands, and briefly contend with and push back the equally physically strong Fifth Brother, all with little effort, though he was eventually defeated by the Brother.

He was also strong enough to lift and carry other sentient beings like Chava,<ref name="Legends of the Lasat" /> Ezra Bridger,<ref name="Out of Darkness" /> and Kallus.<ref name="The Honorable Ones" /> While stranded on Bahryn, Zeb demonstrated considerable skill in climbing out of an icy cave while carrying Kallus. <ref name="The Honorable Ones" />

Zeb was also strong enough to take on the Imperial Infiltrator Droid EXD-9. He could also take considerable punishment at the hands of the powerful recon droid.<ref name="Warhead" /> Zeb was also strong enough to single-handedly hold a hyperdrive unit in one hand while clinging onto rocks at the same time.<ref name="Kindred" />
s" />
Zeb used his physical strength to subdue the Mining Guild captain Seevor. Later, Zeb acquitted himself well against the Mining Guild overseer Proach, who wielded an electro-whip. Despite being outmaneuvered by his more wily and agile opponent, Zeb used his strength and brute force to defeat his opponent. Zeb felt pain when stung by the electro-whip but managed to shake Proach off and hold on long enough for Kanan to rescue him.<ref name="Crawler Commandeers" />

Zeb was fearsome in hand-to-hand combat mostly because of his physiology and would have beat Rukh to death in their first encounter had Sabine not intervened.<ref name="DUME" /> During the liberation of Lothal, Zeb used his prehensile legs to pry open the blast doors to the Dome's upper level and later to trap Rukh's leg against two metal bars.<ref name="Family Reunion & Farewell" />

As a member of the Lasat Honor Guard, Zeb was a skilled fighter who was trained in the art of the bo-rifle. Due to his large physique and combat skills, Zeb served as the "muscle" of the small Lothalian rebel cell. He enjoyed fighting and beating up stormtroopers.<ref name="Droids in Distress" /> While Zeb was unable to match the Force powers of the two Inquisitors known as the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister, he was able to rescue his companions Ezra and Sabine by luring them and their captors to a hangar bay where they made a quick escape in their shuttle, the ''Phantom''.<ref name="Always Two There Are" /> Zeb's combat skills led him to pride himself as a "warrior" and he took offense at being called a "child" or "fool".<ref name="Legends of the Lasat" />

Despite not having any formal training, Orrelios turned out to be a skilled pilot, on one occasion stealing an Imperial TIE fighters and teaching himself how to fly it. On this single joyride, Orrelios managed to hover, spin, fire the cannons, fly sideways, and land without causing any damage to the craft. Orrelios and Bridger had to land in order to clean off the canopy, which had been covered in fruit juices. After taking off again, Orrelios attacked an Imperial prisoner transport convoy, and rescued Ezra Bridger by flying inverted with his head and arms dangling out of the open cockpit, and controlling the yoke with his feet.<ref name="Fighter Flight" />

Despite his combat abilities, Zeb was no match for the Force powers of the former Sith Maul, who easily bested Zeb and his comrades.<ref name="Holocrons" /> Zeb was also a competent tactician who worked with the former Imperial inventory droid AP-5 to plan a mission to evacuate cargo from a derelict Imperial cargo ship. He was also familiar with technology such as grappling hooks and magnetic cables.<ref name="The Wynkahthu Job" />

Though Zeb and Sabine were outmatched by Rukh's cloaking device, the two were able to work together to defeat him. Zeb was also a competent marksman and used his mortar to fire upon Imperial troops and patrol transports during a skirmish at the Lothal cliff dwelling.<ref name="A Fool's Hope" />

==Behind the scenes==
Garazeb Orrelios<ref>[http://www.disney.com.au/disney-xd/star-wars-rebels-characters Full name confirmation]</ref> was first revealed as a character from the forthcoming animated series ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' at the [[January]] [[2014]] [[Wikipedia:Nuremberg International Toy Fair|Nuremberg International Toy Fair]]. Zeb is mentioned on the packaging for the ''LEGO Star Wars Rebels'' ''Ghost'' model, which encourages players to put Zeb on patrol in the ''Ghost''{{'s}} 360-degree rotating [[cockpit]]. The Nuremburg box named the character as "Zeb Orretios," but images of the finalized set boxes updated his name to Orrelios.

In the series, he is voiced by veteran actor [[Steve Blum]].<ref name="IGN Zeb">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/18/star-wars-rebels-exclusive-first-look-meet-zeb |title=Star Wars Rebels Exclusive First Look: Meet Zeb |accessdate=2014-02-18|date=2014-02-18|publisher=IGN.com}}</ref> In Orrelios's introduction video, Orrelios was stated to be a new [[species]] based on [[Ralph McQuarrie]]'s concept art for the Wookiee [[Chewbacca]]. However, the concept art had already been used as the basis for the Lasat species, and the [[Launch Pad]] department of [[Star Wars Insider 148|''Star Wars Insider'' 148]] correctly identified him as a Lasat.<ref name="Launch Pad">{{InsiderCite|148|Launch Pad}}</ref>

===Non-canon history===
Zeb Orellios appears in ''[[Angry Birds Star Wars II]]''. He was aboard the ''Ghost'' when Sabine Wren and Hera Syndulla rescued the orphan Ezra Bridger and escaped from Agent Kallus.<ref name="Angry Birds">''[[Angry Birds Star Wars II]]''</ref> In the ''[[LEGO Star Wars Movie Short|LEGO Star Wars Rebels Movie Shorts]]'', Orellios, Jarrus, Syndulla, were drinking in the [[Chalmun's Cantina|Mos Eisley Cantina]] when Bridger called for a rescue. They went to the ''Ghost'' and rescued the young orphan. Bridger then suggested they charge the Star Destroyer's bridge and hide behind it, and eventually the warship jumped to hyperspace.<ref name="Saving the Phantom">''[[LEGO Star Wars Movie Short]]''</ref> At another time, the ''Ghost'' was damaged by a Star Destroyer, forcing it to go to a [[space station]] for repairs.
