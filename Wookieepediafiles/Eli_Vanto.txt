{{Quote|You belong on the bridge, not the conveyer.|Commander Faro, to Eli Vanto|Thrawn (novel)}}
'''Eli Vanto''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] who initially served as an [[ensign]] and later a [[commander]] in the [[Imperial Navy]] during the [[Imperial Era|era]] of the [[Galactic Empire]]. For several [[Standard year|years]], Vanto served as a translator, [[aide]], student, and protégé of the [[Chiss]] known as [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]], who became a rising star in the Imperial [[Navy]]. Vanto served alongside Thrawn in several Imperial military operations against smugglers and insurgents. Due to his close friendship and loyalty to Thrawn, Vanto's promotion was overlooked for several years by the [[Imperial Military]] hierarchy which [[xenophobia|despised]] [[alien]]s and looked down on [[Wild Space]] outsiders like Vanto.

Following the intervention of the future [[Lothal]]ian [[Governor]] [[Arihnda Pryce]] and [[Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]], Vanto received his long overdue promotion and eventually rose to the rank of Commander. While pursuing the shadowy insurgent leader known as [[Nevil Cygni|Nightswan]], Eli discovered evidence that the Empire was transporting large quantities of [[doonium]] and other precious metals for a mysterious mega project which turned out to be the first [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]]. Following the defeat of Nightswan during the [[Batonn sector insurgency]], Commander Vanto was dispatched by Thrawn into the [[Unknown Regions]] to serve as the Empire's attache to the [[Chiss Ascendancy]].

==Biography==
===Early Life===
Eli Vanto grew up on [[Lysatra]], a [[planet]] found in [[Wild Space]], where [[Sexes|his]] [[parent]]s owned a [[Vanto family shipping company|shipping company]] that operated in the [[Unknown Regions]]. Because of this, Vanto spent a lot of [[time]] picking up several [[language]]s, one of which was [[Sy Bisti]]. In later [[Standard year|years]], he became a [[Imperial cadet|cadet]] at the [[Myomar Academy]] in the [[Expansion Region]] and was on track to becoming a supply [[officer]].<ref name="Thrawn" />

===First contact===
Near the end of his training at the Myomar Academy, Vanto and his fellow cadets were part of an Imperial scouting party led by [[Colonel]] [[Mosh Barris]] and [[Captain]] [[Voss Parck]]. While pursuing smugglers, they explored an uncharted [[Unidentified planet (Thrawn's exile)|planet]] in Wild Space. During the expedition, Vanto and Captain Parck were summoned by Colonel Barris to investigate a hut which did not appear to match anything of known design. The Imperial scouting party also found eight boxes near the hut that were inscribed in an unknown language which turned out to be Sy Bisti. Since the [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] [[droid]]s could not decipher Sy Bisti, Vanto was tasked with translating the script.<ref name="Thrawn" />

The Imperial party proceeded to set up camp around the hut but were attacked by an unknown assailant, who killed five [[Imperial Navy trooper]]s and a [[stormtrooper]]. The attacker also downed a [[Alpha-3 Nimbus-class V-wing starfighter|V-wing starfighter]] and killed the starfighter's [[pilot]] in order to study his adversaries and the craft's communications equipment. Despite the confusion, Vanto was able to determine the attacker was a [[humanoid]] and speculated that he had possibly been stranded on the planet since the [[Clone Wars]]. Due to the attack, a decision was made to evacuate the hut and everything in it aboard the orbiting [[Venator-class Star Destroyer|''Venator''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Strikefast]]''.<ref name="Thrawn" />

===Meeting Thrawn===
[[File:CaptiveThrawn.png|left|thumb|250px|Vanto and Parck question Thrawn]]
Once aboard the ''Strikefast'', Captain Parck realized that the attacker had stowed aboard their transport and ordered that the [[hangar]] lights be dimmed. To the surprise of Eli and the others, the attacker surrendered himself to the ship's stormtroopers. Eli recognized the intruder as a [[Chiss]] [[Sexes|man]], a blue-skinned species whom Vanto had regarded as a Wild Space myth. In his childhood, Vanto had heard stories of the Chiss and that they used the Sy Bisti language. While the Chiss could understand both Sy Bisti and Galactic Basic, he was more proficient in the former. Since Vanto knew Sy Bisti, Captain Parck tasked him with serving as a translator between his Imperial superiors and the Chiss prisoner. The Chiss introduced himself as [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo]] but allowed Vanto and his superior officers to call him "Thrawn".<ref name="Thrawn" />

During the interrogation, Thrawn admitted attacking and killing Imperial personnel on the uncharted world in order to test the mettle of his Imperial opponents. Thrawn also claimed that he been exiled by his people for launching a preemptive attack on an unidentified foe. Thrawn explained that he had come to seek the Empire's help in protecting his people from various mysterious dangers in the Unknown Regions. Due to his knowledge of the Chiss and Sy Bisti, Captain Parck realized that Vanto was cut out to be more than a [[Quartermaster|supply officer]] and appointed him as Thrawn's translator. Recognizing Thrawn's potential, Parck decided to take Thrawn to the galactic capital [[Coruscant]], believing that the [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] would be interested in the Chiss warrior.<ref name="Thrawn" />

[[File:Thrawn-meets-the-Emperor.png|right|thumb|250px|Vanto, Parck and Thrawn meet the emperor]]
For the rest of the journey, Vanto spent time alone with Thrawn and briefed him about the Empire and his own upbringing on Lysatra. The Emperor was indeed interested in meeting the Chiss warrior. He summoned Thrawn, Eli, Captain Parck, Colonel Barris, and the other stormtrooper and Imperial Navy witnesses for a private audience at the [[Imperial Palace]]. During the meeting, Thrawn claimed that there were unspecified dangers lurking in the Unknown Regions and offered his skills, knowledge, and service to the Empire in return for receiving a guarantee of protection for his people. The Emperor accepted Thrawn's offer to serve as his advisor on matters relating to the Unknown Regions. Thrawn also managed to persuade the Emperor to permanently assign Eli as his translator and [[aide]].<ref name="Thrawn" />

===The Royal Imperial Academy===
Since Vanto was due to graduate from the [[Imperial Academy]] in three [[Standard month|months]], he and Thrawn were assigned to the [[Royal Imperial Academy]]; which was regarded as the most prestigious of the Imperial Academies. Since Thrawn was designated as a "fancy-face soldier" who needed a little orientation in Imperial procedure, equipment, and terminology, he was also given three months to complete the course. Eli and Thrawn found the Royal Imperial Academy a hostile environment, with several of the faculty and students including [[Commandant]] [[Deenlark]] not welcoming the presence of a "backwater yokel" from Wild Space and an "alien." While Vanto was initially wary of the Emperor's decision, he came to appreciate Thrawn as a friend.<ref name="Thrawn" />

During Thrawn's orientation, Vanto briefed the Chiss about the [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] and regional prejudices within the Imperial military establishment. In return, Thrawn confided that he had indeed met [[Jedi General]] [[Anakin Skywalker]] during the [[Clone Wars]]. After Thrawn experienced three altercations from the other Imperial cadets, Vanto urged him to report the incidents to Commandant Deenlark. Thrawn was unwilling to do so to avoid jeopardizing his position at the Academy. While talking, Vanto received a [[comlink]] message from the wealthy [[Coruscanti]] cadet [[Spenc Orbar]] inviting him and Thrawn to play cards while he and his friend [[Rosita Turuy]] were running corrosion tests on their alloy boards.<ref name="Thrawn" />

[[File:RoyalAcademyAttack.png|left|thumb|250px|Vanto watches in horror as Thrawn is attacked by three hooded figures]]
Thrawn accepted the invitation and met Orbar and Turuy at the laboratory. Thrawn beat Orbar and Turuy in a game of cards, earning the enmity of the two cadets. Following the game, Vanto and Thrawn headed back to [[Barracks Two]]. On the way, Thrawn gave Vanto a lesson in martial arts by shoving him against a barrier. Shortly later, the two were ambushed by three masked assailants. Eli managed to blind two of the attackers by hurling gravel at them. Despite being outnumbered, Thrawn managed to wound the thigh of one of the assailants. At that point, five other cadets spotted the commotion and the three troublemakers were forced to flee. Thrawn then accepted Eli's advice to report the incident to Commandant Deenlark.<ref name="Thrawn" />

During the meeting with Commandant Deenlark, Vanto assisted Thrawn as he related his theory that Orbar and Turuy had instigated the attack. Vanto also advocated checking their comlink records or the lab's own comm system. While Deenlark had enough evidence to take disciplinary action against Orbay and Turuy, he was reluctant to risk a political fallout. In response, Thrawn proposed transferring the three trouble-makers to the [[Skystrike Academy]] at short notice in order scare Orbay and Turuy into not causing anymore trouble. Following the meeting, Thrawn confided that Deenlark was beholden to Orbay and Turuy's family, citing the presence of a flatsculp depicting a sailing ship in the Commandant's office. Vanto also learned that Chiss comms were also equipped with emergency buttons and that Thrawn had purportedly been exiled by the [[Chiss Ascendancy]] for launching a preemptive strike on nomadic pirates who preyed on defenseless worlds.<ref name="Thrawn" />

===Chasing smugglers===
{{Quote|Interesting. I am to be the second weapons officer abroad the ''Gozanti''-class cruiser ''Blood Crow''.''"<br />"''Nice.''"<br />"''And you? I assume you asked for a supply officer position?''"<br />"''I did. Good chance I got it too. The bigger ships are always hurting for supply personnel&hellip;the ''Blood Crow''&hellip;aide to&hellip;Lieutenant Thrawn. Lieutenants don't get aides. Ever. You set this up with the Emperor, didn't you?''"<br />"''The Emperor does not speak to me. Nor have I spoken with him since my first day on this world.''"<br />"''This didn't happen by accident! You must have said something! What was it?''"<br />"''The ''Blood Crow'' is scheduled for duty in border sectors where Sy Bisti may be spoken. I merely pointed out it may be beneficial to have two officers aboard who understand the language. If you wish, I will refuse to except you in that position.''"<br />"''No point. The navy doesn't change orders just because junior officers don't like them. When you're an admiral, we'll see what you can do.''"<br />"''Very well. I strive to achieve that rank as quickly as possible.|Thrawn and Eli|Thrawn, Part I}}
Three months later, Eli Vanto and Thrawn graduated and were the third and second to receive their assignments from the Royal Imperial Academy respectively. After graduation, Vanto was greeted by both his parents, who congratulated their son for his success. Vanto also tried to allay his parents' fears about the Chiss. Their first meeting with Thrawn proved to be a brief and awkward encounter and they took leave, claiming that they had to catch an [[airbus]] to their landing platform. Shortly later, Vanto discovered to his dismay that he was to be assigned as an aide with the rank of [[Ensign]] to Lieutenant Thrawn, who was the Weapons Officer aboard the [[Gozanti-class cruiser|''Gozanti''-class cruiser]] ''[[Blood Crow]]''. Despite his friendship with Thrawn, Eli feared that being an aide would adversely affect his career advancement in the Imperial Navy. While Eli was upset, Thrawn reassured him that his knowledge of Sy Bisti was useful because the ''Blood Crow'' was assigned to border sectors where the language was spoken.<ref name="Thrawn" />

For the next eighteen months, Ensign Eli and Lieutenant Thrawn would serve under the command of [[Captain]] [[Rik Virgilio]], who maintained a respectful relationship with the two. The ''Blood Crow'' saw action trapping smugglers, rendering aid to distressed vehicles, and defusing potentially damaging political situations in the [[Mid Rim]] and [[Outer Rim Territories]]. Captain Virgilio was subsequently replaced by [[Captain]] [[Filia Rossi]] and [[Senior Lieutenant]] [[Nels Deyland]]. Captain Rossi resented the fact that Thrawn had his own aide. Despite her antagonism, Thrawn managed to convince her to let him keep several [[Clone Wars]] antiques including a [[droideka]], two [[Pistoeka sabotage droid|buzz droids]], half of a [[Single Trooper Aerial Platform|STAP]], and a [[Hyperspace transport ring|hyperspace ring]] which he had purchased with his own expenses until they reached the planet [[Ansion]]. Eli was one of the few who was privy to Thrawn's secret that these weapons were still operational.<ref name="Thrawn" />

[[File:Dromedar.png|right|thumb||250px|Vanto and Thrawn take a shuttle to the Dromedar]]
Later, Eli and Thrawn were part of a boarding party that was dispatched on a shuttle to search the derelict freighter ''[[Dromedar]]'', which had been carrying a shipment of [[tibanna]]. Once aboard, they encountered a man named [[Nevil Cygni]] who claimed that his crew had been kidnapped by pirates. In fact, Cygni was the leader of the pirates who was also the enigmatic rebel leader known as "Nightswan". While Captain Rossi was reluctant to aid the kidnapped crew since she had more pressing issues to attend to at a [[Ho'Din]] [[Unidentified Ho'Din settlement|settlement]] on [[Moltok]], Thrawn managed to convince her to let him and Eli remain behind with three other crew members: Ensign Barlin and the technicians [[Layneo]] and [[Jakeeb]]. Thrawn also brought his buzz droids aboard the ''Dromedar''.<ref name="Thrawn" />

While the Imperials searched for the ship's cargo, Cygni revealed that he was one of the pirates. Twelve other pirates including a man named [[Angel (pirate)|Angel]] emerged from hiding and took Eli and the other Imperials prisoners. The Imperials were then thrown into a cage aboard the pirate ship's cargo bay with the ship's ten crew. After Cygni and most of the pirates had reboarded the ''Dromedar'' with the stolen tibanna and jumped into hyperspace, Thrawn hatched his escape plan. With the help of the technicians, Thrawn activated one of the buzz droid and used it to cut a hole through the cage. Eli along with the other Imperials and ship crew then managed to overpower the remaining pirates. The other pirates were killed when the second buzz droid exposed the entrance chamber and amidships section of the vessel to vacuum.<ref name="Thrawn" />

Despite rescuing the crew and capturing the pirates, Captain Rossi was displeased with Lieutenant Thrawn for taking risks. In retaliation, she suspended Thrawn and Ensign Vanto from duty and left them at the [[Ansion Imperial base|Imperial base]] on Ansion. Despite this setback, Thrawn put their suspension to good use by interrogating the captured pirates about where they had hidden the tibanna. With Ensign Vanto and [[Admiral]] [[Wiskovis]] acting as witnesses, Thrawn managed to convince three of the captured pirates to reveal the location of the tibanna in return for protecting them from the feared [[Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]]. While the pirates discussed Thrawn's offer in Sy Bisti, Thrawn and Vanto eavesdropped and learned that the pirates had taken the ''Dromedar'' and its tibanna cargo to the planet [[Uba]]. The pirates accepted Thrawn's offer and claimed that Cygni and Angel had taken the ''Dromedar'' to [[Cartherston]] on the planet [[Keitum]]. After the pirates had left, Wiskovis acted on Thrawn's information and dispatched Imperial forces to Uba to recover the ''Dromedar'' and its cargo.<ref name="Thrawn" />

===Playing second fiddle===
Following the events aboard the ''Dromedar'' and on Ansion, Ensign Vanto and Lieutenant Thrawn traveled to Coruscant to await their court martial. During the [[Ascension Week]] holidays, they befriended the [[Imperial Security Bureau]] officer [[Colonel]] [[Wullf Yularen]], who took them to an Imperial ball at the [[Alisandre Hotel]] in Coruscant's upmarket [[Federal District]] for social networking purposes. The [[Lothal]]ian [[Senator]] [[Domus Renking]] introduced them to his citizen advisory officer [[Arihnda Pryce]]. When Yularen regaled Renking and Pryce with the story of how Thrawn and Vanto had overpowered the pirates, Vanto reassured the Colonel that he was not overstating their case. Thrawn then responded that Vanto was being too modest about his own and his comrades' contributions.<ref name="Thrawn" />

After the ballroom function, Colonel Yularen informed Thrawn and Eli that the [[Imperial High Command]] had taken up Thrawn's suggestion and were investigating whether Cygni had taken the stolen tibanna gas to the planet [[Kril'Dor]], near the [[Uba system]]. The two learned that Cygni had escaped the Imperial cordon and that he had somehow found a way to extract the tibanna from twelve of the cylinders recovered from the ''Dromedar''. The Imperial authorities had also taken interest in a shadowy individual known as Nightswan. At the time, the Empire was unaware that Nightswan was a pseudonym for Cygni. To both Eli and Thrawn's relief, Lieutenant Thrawn was cleared of any wrongdoing by the court martial. Since Eli came from a shipping family, Thrawn asked him about the Imperial Navy's unusual purchase of [[doonium]]. The two speculated that the doonium was being used for some [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|unspecified mega project]].<ref name="Thrawn" />

Following the court marial, Vanto was approached by [[Culper]], an aide of [[Moff]] [[Ghadi]]. She offered him a job as an assistant military attache to the [[governor]] of a prestigious [[Inner Rim]] system. Moff Ghadi was jealous of Thrawn's successful career and hoped to enlist Vanto's help in bring the Chiss officer down. When Culper revealed her true motives and mocked Vanto for his Wild Space origins, he turned down the offer. Culper then warned him that Moff Ghadi would make certain that Vanto's career would be of no importance. She told him to get comfortable with being an Ensign, exposing Moff Ghadi's intention to curtail his career. Vanto did not mention the incident to Thrawn, who informed them that he had been promoted to [[Captain]] and posted aboard the [[Arquitens-class light cruiser|''Arquitens''-class light cruiser]] ''[[Thunder Wasp]]'' in the Mid Rim. Though Vanto would still be accompanying Thrawn, he was disappointed that he still had not been promoted.<ref name="Thrawn" />

===Following Nightswan's trail===
A year later, Ensign Vanto took part in a successful operation led by Captain Thrawn and Commander [[Alfren Cheno]] to capture a group of [[Iridium (element)|iridium]] smugglers on the planet Ulba. Eli and Thrawn found Cheno to be a more cooperative commanding officer than Captain Rossi or Culper. Thrawn and Eli had managed to hunt down the smugglers by using a trail of [[mollusk]] meat and [[makorr]] predators to follow their underwater transport. In their haste, the smugglers had dumped the mollusk meat overboard to make room for the iridium instead of periodically releasing smaller chunks of the meat. In private, Thrawn praised Eli for his growing aptitude for the art of tactics. Eli also discussed his months-long investigation into the Imperial Navy's procurement of large amounts of doonium for a hidden project. Eli and Thrawn also talked about reports that Nightswan had been procuring Clone Wars equipment and smuggled metals for unknown purposes.<ref name="Thrawn" />

Later, Ensign Vanto took part in the Imperial [[Battle over Umbara|pacification]] of the [[Umbaran]] homeworld of [[Umbara]]. The Imperial assault on Umbara was commanded by [[Admiral]] [[Carlou Gendling]]. Prior to the assault, Vanto informed Captain Thrawn that Commander Cheno had requested a meeting with him at the bridge. Vanto found that Thrawn had been studying the art of the Umbaran people. Vanto also informed Thrawn that Admiral Gendling's [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|Imperial Star Destroyer]] ''[[Foremost]]'' had arrived in the [[Umbara system]] with four corvettes. Vanto told Thrawn that Admiral Gendling was confident that he could force the Umbarans into submission with these forces.<ref name="Thrawn" />

At the bridge, Vanto checked weapons diagnostics station while Commander Cheno confided that Admiral Gendling was impatient and had ignored his advice to wait for the rest of his force. Despite Admiral Gendling's predictions that the Umbarans would not attack, the Umbarans dispatched 400 [[Variable Geometry Self-Propelled Battle Droid, Mark I|Vulture droids]] to attack the Imperial squadron. Eli noticed that the Vulture droids were coming from an Umbaran moon. The Imperial ships were overwhelmed by the tiny nimble fighters, which exploited gaps in their [[deflector shield]]s to inflict damage. During the battle, Thrawn studied the Vulture droid's attack patterns and concluded that they were being controlled by a transmitter on an outlying moon. After sharing his findings with Eli, Thrawn convinced Commander Cheno to countermand Admiral Gendling and order the Imperial ships to bombard the transmitter's station. Thrawn's plan worked and the Umbarans capitulated.<ref name="Thrawn" />

However, Admiral Gendling was furious that Commander Cheno had countermanded his orders and warned there would be repercussions. Following the battle, Eli briefed Thrawn about his findings that the transmitted had been operating from a building owned by a group of humans. These humans were strangers to the Umbaran system. Despite the lack of hard evidence, Thrawn believed that Nighswan had a hand in the Umbaran rebellion due to his involvement in mining and metal smuggling. After analyzing the shipping records, Eli and Thrawn reached the conclusion that Nightswan had engineered an Imperial takeover of Umbara's mines since it would be easier for him and his smugglers to bribe Imperial inspectors than the Umbarans. Thrawn also confided in Eli that Nightswan was trying to send a message to him.<ref name="Thrawn" />

===Intrigue on Coruscant===
Following the pacification of Umbara, Eli and Thrawn discussed the injustice of Commander Cheno being forced into retirement. While Thrawn was upset that the Imperial Navy had punished a competed officer who had won the battle and saved many lives, Eli explained that Admiral Gendling had been slighted by Cheno and had used his political connections to exact revenge. Eli also reassured Thrawn that it could have been worst since Cheno had protected Thrawn from being "thrown to the wolves." Eli explained that the Imperial Navy hierarchy did not accept Thrawn because he was not human and not from the [[Core Worlds]]. Despite the hostility of the Imperial hierarchy, the two endeavored to continue their investigations into Nightswan.<ref name="Thrawn" />

At Colonel Yularen's recommendation, Ensign Vanto and Captain Thrawn decided to accompany the ISB officer and two subordinates [[Roenton]] and [[Brook]] on a visit to the [[Yinchom Dojo]], which trained and supplied bodyguards for the [[Imperial Senate]] and various ministry officials. Yularen wanted to investigate whether the dojo was involved in seditious activities. During their visit, Eli and Thrawn encountered Arihnda Pryce, a former aide of Senator Renking who was now working for the [[Higher Skies Advocacy Group]]. Thrawn also took part in a sparring exercise with the dojo's owner, the [[Togorian]] Instructor [[H'sishi]]. Following the meeting, Thrawn discussed his suspicions about the apprehensive behavior of one of the instructors, [[Juahir Madras]]. Thrawn also concluded that H'sishi harbored no ill intentions towards Imperials.<ref name="Thrawn" />

Following their visit to the Yimchom Dojo, Vanto and Thrawn received news that they would spend the next four weeks at the Imperial Palace with Emperor Palpatine while the ''Thunder Wasp'' underwent repairs. After completing its repairs, the ship would return to Mid Rim and Outer Rim patrol duties. Captain Thrawn was also promoted to the rank of Commander. To Vanto's dismay, he was not promoted. Though Eli tried to suppress his dismay, Thrawn sensed his friend's frustration. Thrawn realized that Vanto had held the rank of ensign a full year longer that was customary even though he had done nothing wrong that would have delayed his promotion. Vanto in fact knew that he had not been promoted since he had incurred the opposition of Moff Ghadi's aide, who disliked Thrawn.<ref name="Thrawn" />

Later, Thrawn met with Arihnda Pryce, who informed him of her problems with Moff Ghadi and Higher Skies. She asked Thrawn to help her protect herself from prosecution being threatened by Moff Ghadi, the same person responsible for impeding Vanto's career. Thrawn agreed, and in return she promised to make sure Vanto would be promoted, and offered to aid Thrawn in the political arena by using her political connections. At Thrawn's request, Pryce also agreed to use her political connections to speed up the repairs to the ''Thunder Wasp''.<ref name="Thrawn" />

===The Cyphar dispute===
[[File:Thrawn 4 Cyphar.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Vanto and Thrawn as they approach Cyphar]]
Following the repairs to the ''Thunder Wasp'', Ensign Vanto and Commander Thrawn were dispatched to resolve a [[Cyphar Incident|land dispute]] on the planet [[Cyphar]] between the [[Afe clan]] of the indigenous [[Cyphari]] and a group of human colonists from the [[Hollenside Enclave]]. The colonists claimed that the Afes had been raiding their border settlements and demanded concessions and a safety buffer zone that would annex nearly half the Afes' land and force them to move into lands controlled by other Afes. The Afes claimed they had lived on the land for centuries and claimed their attacks were in response to human trespassing and border raids. Thrawn had requested this assignment with the support of Colonel Yularen.<ref name="Thrawn" />

While analyzing shipping records from Cyphar, Eli speculated that the humans had discovered a new vein of precious metals beneath the Afes territory, hence their demand for Afe land. Eli also suggested that the human colonists were smuggling precious metals inside the shellfish, explaining the spike in shellfish exports over the past four months. Eli and Thrawn thought that Nightswan had instigated the Cyphar dispute. After meeting with the colonists, Thrawn and Vanto deduced that [[Lenora Scath]], [[Brigte Polcery]], and [[Clay Tanoo]] were involved in the conspiracy based on their facial expressions and mannerisms. They speculated that [[Mayor]] [[Pord Benchel]] had been duped.<ref name="Thrawn" />

Eli and Thrawn then met with the Afe [[Chief]] [[Joko (Cyphari)|Joko]], who admitted that members of his clan had cross the border to launch reprisal attacks against the human colonists. After Chief Joko brought them to the site of the incursions, Commander Thrawn decided to set a trap for the colonists. After studying the colonists' attack patterns, Vanto observed that they were moving northwards towards the large population centers in an attempt to provoke a stronger reaction from the Afes. This confirmed Thrawn and Vanto's earlier hypothesis that the colonists had launched the incursions in order to draw attention away from their mining operation and to provoke hostilities with the Afe. When Vanto suggested bringing down reinforcements, Thrawn reassured him that the two of them would be sufficient.<ref name="Thrawn" />

[[File:Thrawn 4 Cyphar land dispute.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Vanto stuns all of Tanoo's team]]
That night, Eli and Thrawn hid in the Afe meeting house as the colonists arrived at the Afe village. Eli discovered that the Afe grain fields covered a vein of material that was a precursor to a [[spice]] variety called [[scarn]]. After Thrawn called for Imperial shuttles and troops, Vanto waited in the hut to fire at the raiders while Thrawn disabled the colonists' [[landspeeder]]s. During the brief firefight, Eli managed to [[stun]] two of the colonists with his [[blaster]]. Thrawn captured several of the colonists' ring leaders including Tanoo. After the colonists had been apprehended, Thrawn ordered his TIE fighters and the ''Thunder Wasp'' to bombard the disputed land in order to destroy the scarn and dissuade the colonists from raiding Afe land in the future.<ref name="Thrawn" />

Eli watched as Lieutenant [[Gimm (lieutenant)|Gimm's]] [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighter]] razed grazing lands, marshes, and croplands which covered the scarn trail. Thrawn's unorthodox actions angered Chief Joko, who protested that the bombing had destroyed farmland and damaged homes and water springs. Thrawn countered that the destruction of the pre-spice was necessary to stop further attacks by the colonists. Vanto also informed Thrawn that Coruscant was furious with his actions. When Vanto expressed frustration with the Imperial military hierarchy for not appreciating that Thrawn had ended the Afe-colonist conflict, exposed a criminal conspiracy and destroyed a source of illicit spice, Thrawn explained that the Imperials wanted a commander who followed procedures.<ref name="Thrawn" />

Thrawn told Eli that he was prepared to return to Coruscant to report the truth. Later, Eli met with the TIE fighter pilot Lieutenant Gimm and deduced that he was one of the trouble-makers who had assaulted him and Thrawn at the Royal Imperial Academy years ago. When Gimm pointed out that he was still an ensign, Vanto countered that he was serving the best commander in the Imperial Navy. Deenlark mocked Thrawn's predicament and claimed that Commander Deenlark had pulled enough strings for him and his fellow attackers to be transferred to the Skystrike Academy. Despite Gimm's taunts, Vanto controlled his temper and comforted himself with the knowledge that Thrawn had been proven right in his observation that Gimm would make an excellent starfighter pilot.<ref name="Thrawn" />

===Promotion===
Honoring her promise to Thrawn, Pryce met with [[Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]] and provided him with incriminating evidence about Higher Skies' [[Imperial espionage operation|espionage]] against high-ranking Imperial officials and Moff Ghadi's willingness to exploit information that Higher Skies had illegally obtained about Tarkin. In return, she asked for the [[governor]]ship of her [[homeworld]] of [[Lothal]] and to give Eli a long overdue promotion. Tarkin accepted Pryce's deal and issued orders for the arrest of the Higher Skies members including the instructor Juahir Madras and Moff Ghadi. Tarkin also used his political clout to improve Thrawn and Vanto's standing in the Imperial Navy hierarchy.<ref name="Thrawn" />

After Thrawn was cleared by a military hearing, Vanto and Thrawn disrupted four smuggling operations, three of which were smuggling black market doonium. Eli also identified at least five other smuggling operations that fitted Nightswan's pattern but which occurred outside the ''Thunder Wasp''{{'s}} patrol area. Eli and Thrawn also continued to investigate why Nightswan seemed to be obsessed with stealing doonium from the Empire, and what the Empire wanted to use the doonium for. Only Colonel Yularen seemd to take Thrawn's warnings about Nightswan seriously. After studying the doonium shipping records, Eli realized that the Empire was not using the doonium to build ships. He came to speculate that the Empire was stockpiling the doonium for some yet unknown purpose.<ref name="Thrawn" />

Following these anti-smuggling operations, both Vanto and Thrawn were summoned back to Coruscant. They were received by several high-ranking Imperial military officers and officials including Grand Moff Tarkin. Thrawn was promoted to the rank of [[Commodore]]. Then, to Vanto's surprise, he was commended for his stellar career, and promoted to the rank of [[Lieutenant Commander]], an exceptionally high achievement for a junior ranking officer. Following the promotion ceremony, Tarkin praised the two men and told them that the-now Governor Pryce had sent her regards and congratulations. Receiving their new orders, Lieutenant Commander Vanto and Commodore Thrawn learned that they had been reassigned to the [[Imperial I-class Star Destroyer|''Imperial I''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Chimaera]]''. Prior to leaving the ''Thunder Wasp'', Vanto made a mental note to pay his former tormentor Lieutenant Gimm a visit.<ref name="Thrawn" />

===Attack on the ''Sempre''===
[[File:Sempre aftermath.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The aftermath of the attack on the ''Sempre'']]
While stationed aboard the ''Chimaera'', Lieutenant-Commander Eli Vanto and Commodore Thrawn received a distress call from the troop transport ''[[Sempre]]'', which had been [[Attack on the Sempre|attacked]] by the frigate ''[[Castilus]]'' and two squadrons of [[V-19 Torrent starfighter]]s. While Eli suspected that Nightswan was behind the attack, Thrawn disagreed because overly violent attacks were not his usual style. However, [[Executive officer|First Officer]] [[Karyn Faro]] responded that Nightswan's styles could change and pointed out that Nightswan and followers were already attacking and killing Imperial personnel. When Thrawn raised a question about the transport's mysterious cargo, the [[Stormtrooper commander|Stormtrooper Commander]] [[Ayer]] reported that the ''Sempre'' was not carrying troops. When Eli inquired into the matter, Ayer responded that he was not at liberty to discuss the ship's cargo.<ref name="Thrawn" />

Per orders from Coruscant, Thrawn delivered Stormtrooper Commander Ayer and his troops to the ''Sempre''. By the time that the ''Chimaera'' had arrived, the attacking ships had already left the scene. Ayer reluctantly allowed Vanto and Thrawn to accompany his troopers aboard the transport. Vanto observed that several of the fallen crew displayed injuries on their heads and bodies consistent with beatings. Vanto also found a bloody handwritten mark at a high angle of the wall. When Vanto concluded that one of the attackers or passengers had made the mark, Thrawn insisted on examining the troop quarters. A stormtrooper tried to block their way but Thrawn reasserted his authority.<ref name="Thrawn" />

Eli remarked that this was the first time he heard Thrawn raise his voice in anger. Thrawn reassured him that he had merely disrupted the trooper's normal pattern of behavior. Vanto found that the sleeping area's racks were unusually large than the standard trooper carrier racks. When Vanto concluded that the passengers were prisoners, Thrawn added that the troop transport was transporting slaves. After analyzing the attack with First Office Faro, Eli concluded that the attackers had attacked the ''Sempre'' in order to free the slaves. The [[Senior communications officer]] [[Lomar]] also found evidence that the slaves were [[Wookiee]]s.<ref name="Thrawn" />

Thrawn concluded that the ''Sempre'' had been transporting the slaves from [[Kashyyyk]] to an offworld processing center to test for their health and other qualifications. After studying the maps, Eli found that the slave transport had been traveling to the old customs clearing station [[Lansend Twenty-Six]] when it was attacked. Following further discussions, Eli, Thrawn, Faro speculated that the Wookiees' rescuers were going to raid Lansend Twenty-Six to free more slaves and exact retribution. The ''Chimaera'' arrived at Lansend Twenty-Six to find the station under [[Battle at Lansend Twenty-Six|attack]] from the ''Castilus'' and the V-19 starfighters.<ref name="Thrawn" />

[[File:Lansend 26 aftermath.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Wookiee slaves and the attackers are rounded up after the attack on Lansend 26]]
After establishing contact with the station's commander [[Colonel]] [[Zenoc]], Thrawn's reinforcements attacked the insurgent forces. Since the station had already been boarded by intruders, Thrawn ordered Colonel Zenoc to pull back all personnel to [[Section B-eight]]. Thrawn bombarded Lansend Twenty-Six, neutralizing most of the intruders. He also took care to avoid targeting [[Section B-five]], which housed "non-military personnel." Meanwhile, the ''Chimaera'' and its TIE fighters crippled the freighter ''Castilus'' and reduced the enemy starfighters to three ships. As the battle drew to a close, Vanto   expressed his discomfort that the Empire was using Wookiee slaves. Thrawn tried to rationalize [[slavery]] and reiterated that these beings would be treated as "Imperial assets." As a result, Eli learned that the Empire was secretly trafficking Wookiee slaves.<ref name="Thrawn" />

===The Botajef Uprising===
Under orders from [[Fleet Admiral]] [[Jok Donassius]], Lieutenant-Commander Vanto and Commodore Thrawn were tasked with quelling the [[Battle for Botajef|Botajef Uprising]]. [[Quesl]], the human [[Governor]] of [[Botajef]] had unilaterally seceded the planet from the Galactic Empire. Vanto attended a tactical consultation meeting with Thrawn, Commander Faro, and [[Senior Lieutenant]] [[Pyrondi]]. During the meeting, Pyrondi explained that the indigenous [[Jefi]]es had a strong cultural tendency to follow a competent leader. When Eli asked why the Jefies had not complained about Coruscant appointing a human governor, Pyrondi responded that the Jefies were natural followers whose trust Quesl had gained.<ref name="Thrawn" />

With the journey to Botajef taking fifteen [[standard hour|hours]], Thrawn retreated to his quarters to study the history of Botajef, which was characterized by a cycle of long periods of passive allegiance followed by brief outbreaks of fiery conflicts. Two hours before their expected arrival, Vanto visited Commodore Thrawn and confided his concerns that they had been given this assignment because certain people were trying to set Thrawn up. While Vanto did not have hard evidence, he warned Thrawn that there were many government officials who disliked nonhumans. These officials were gambling that Thrawn would either brutally subjugate the Jefies or would be expelled by the [[Botajef Defense Force]]. In the first scenario, they wanted to depict Thrawn as a "mad alien run amok" who had brutally suppressed innocent Jefies and humans obeying their appointed leader. In the second scenario, they wanted to portray Thrawn as an incompetent officer only fit to command an ore carrier.<ref name="Thrawn" />

When Vanto mentioned the ore carrier, Thrawn recalled that their former Captain [[Filia Rossi]] had served as the first officer of an ore freighter before commanding the ''Blood Crow''. Thrawn speculated that Rossi had been escorting doonium and other metals for an unknown but important project. Vanto also recalled that Rossi had previously been posted at [[Socorro]], which had [[asteroid belt]]s that were rich in doonium. Thrawn tasked Vanto with tracking the shipments of doonium and other starship components. Thrawn speculated that the Empire was building a massive [[starship]] under the misguided rationale that "larger meant better." Vanto suggested that Thrawn could find out what this mysterious project was about the next time he visited Coruscant. Vanto also drew a link between the metal shipments and the travel vector for the Wookiee slave ship they had encountered.<ref name="Thrawn" />

At Thrawn's insistence, the two returned to the matter of Botajef. The two discussed the holo-recording of Governor Guesl's declaration of independence, particularly the presence of art pieces hanging on the display wall behind him. Having analyzed the video, Vanto had counted 57 pieces and made holos of every piece visible on that recording. After studying the holo-recording, Vanto and Thrawn concluded that Quesl was goading the Empire into attacking Botajef. Thrawn predicted that Quesl would repeat his challenge directly to the ''Chimaera'' in the presence of the Botajef Defense Force. Before Vanto returned to the bridge, Thrawn ordered him to summon Starfighter Commander [[Yve (Imperial)|Yve]] and Stormtrooper Commander Ayer.<ref name="Thrawn" />

Vanto was at the bridge of the ''Chimaera'' when the Star Destroyer arrived at Botajef. In response, the Botajef Defense Force deployed two [[CR90 corvette]]s and several squadrons of V-19 Torrents. Eli also reported that Quesl had deployed three ground-based [[turbolaser]] clusters including a cluster of five turbolasers that were positioned around the governor's palace. Thrawn ordered TIE fighters to circle the corvettes and V-19s. When Governor Quesl issued his missive to Thrawn, Thrawn distracted him with a faux set of rules and demanded that he remove the turbolaser emplacements. As expected, Governor Quesl refused and goaded the Imperials further.<ref name="Thrawn" />

In response, Thrawn dispatched a special unit of TIE fighters which destroyed the turbolasers but carefully spared the governor's palace. Eli watched the sortie unfold and did not notice that the ''Chimaera'' had drifted a significant distance to starboard towards the corvette above the palace, which turned out to be Governor Quesl' [[command ship]]. The ''Chimaera''{{'s}} movement startled Quesl and his crew aboard the corvette. Having ascertained Governor Quesl's location, Thrawn told the Governor that he had foiled his plot to destroy the palace and escape offworld with the treasures. When Quesl protested were still loyal to him, Thrawn pointed out that he had lost his legitimacy among the Quesl.<ref name="Thrawn" />

With his conspiracy unmasked, Quesl reluctantly admitted he had planned to sell the Jefi art offworld. Eli listened as Thrawn explained that he had used his TIE fighters to startle Quesl in order to ascertain his location. With Quesl defeated, Thrawn ordered the Governor and his crew to surrender aboard the ''Chimaera'' and to return the artwork. He also announced that Quesl would be put on trial, the Jefies "enlightened", and a new Governor would be assigned to Botajef. In private, Thrawn confided with his command crew including Vanto that he had made up the Clone Wars-era treaty in order to distract Quesl. Thrawn also tasked Commander Vanto with contacting the Imperial High Command to inform them that the Botajef Uprising had been resolved.<ref name="Thrawn" />

===The Batonn insurgency===
====An errant mission====
Following the pacification of Botajef, the now-[[Commander]] Vanto along the now-Admiral Thrawn, Colonel Yularen, and Governor Pryce attended a high-level meeting of Imperial admirals and governors chaired by Fleet Admiral Donassius to discuss the [[Batonn sector insurgency]]. On the planet [[Batonn]], a [[Batonn insurgents|group of insurgents]] had [[Battle of Scrim Island|seized control]] of [[Scrim Island]] and taken a hundred hostages including Imperial Navy troopers, technicians, and several civilian workers. The insurgents controlled the island's [[deflector shield]], its shoreline defenses, and three of its [[ion cannon]]s. Admiral Thrawn was given command of the mission but insisted on studying the situation first instead of launching a swift attack. As a result, Fleet Admiral Donassius reassigned Thrawn's [[96th Task Force]] to deal with rebel insurgents on [[Sammun]] and dispatched Admiral [[Durril]] to deal with the Scrim crisis.<ref name="Thrawn" />

Following the meeting, Eli criticized Thrawn for antagonizing Imperial High Command. Thrawn however countered that Admiral Durril had a tendency to value speed over precision and predicted that Durril's assignment would end in failure. Eli realized that Thrawn intended to use Durril's failure to his advantage. Instead of traveling to Sammun, Thrawn gave Commander Faro command of the 96th Task Force while he and Eli infiltrated Batonn in the light freighter ''[[Slipknot]]'', which the Empire had earlier seized from smugglers. While Eli was uncomfortable with circumventing Fleet Admiral Donassius' orders, Thrawn explained that Donassius had dispatched the 96th Task Force to deal with the Sammun insurgency and had not specifically mentioned them. Despite his misgivings, Eli accompanied his friend and commander on their errant mission.<ref name="Thrawn" />

As they approached Batonn, Vanto and Thrawn observed Admiral Durril's [[103rd Task Force]] in disarray. Durril's ships had been unable to disable the deflector shield and the ion cannons on Scrim. Durril's [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|Imperial Star Destroyer]] ''[[Judicator]]'' and its escort ships were damaged by ground-based [[turbolaser]]s. Amidst the fighting, Thrawn instructed Vanto to pose as the weapons smuggler "Horatio Figg" and contact a freighter that was flying away from Batonn. Vanto managed to contact the freighter's crew by feigning interest in the weapons they had stolen from an Imperial base. The crew responded that his boss was interested in talking and transmitted the ''Slipknot'' a series of coordinates.<ref name="Thrawn" />

Eli wanted to help the ''Judicator'' but Thrawn urged him to follow the smugglers' instructions since they were unable to provide assistance to Admiral Durril's task force. While watching the battle, Vanto speculated that their "friend" in the freighter was unable to jump into hyperspace due to a faulty hyperdrive. When Thrawn suggested other possibilities, Vanto suggested that the freighter was monitoring the fighting or could be sending or receiving some last minute instructions. The two also monitored the movements of seven other freighters above Batonn and speculated that these were traveling to seven of the Batonn insurgents' other strongholds on the planet. While Captain [[Brento]] of the light cruiser ''[[Shyrack (Arquitens-class light cruiser)|Shyrack]]'' monitored the movements of the seven freighters, Vanto and Thrawn traveled to the coordinates given by the eighth freighter.<ref name="Thrawn" />

====Confronting Nightswan====
Arriving at the smuggling ships' coordinates, Vanto contacted the smugglers on the freighter's comm and proposed dealing business with them. Following the smuggler's coordinates, they approached a [[Nomad (starship)|Nomad]], a large traveling ship and repair shop that dated back to the [[Clone Wars]]. Under Thrawn's instruction, Vanto donned a blaster-singed Imperial officer's tunic which Figg had purportedly stolen from an officer he had killed. Thrawn also equipped Vanto with an old remote and told him to press the tile closest to the center of his chest when the time came. For the mission, Eli brought a hold-out blaster that was hidden under his arm. While Thrawn hid aboard the freighter, Vanto landed the ship at a landing slot.<ref name="Thrawn" />

When Eli met with the insurgents, he allowed them to search him. The insurgents discovered his Imperial Navy sidearm and brought him to the Shipmaster's compartment where he was greeted by Nevil Cygni, who identified himself as the elusive "Nightswan." Nightswan told Eli that he was aware that Admiral Thrawn had sent him to seek him out. Since his disguise had failed to fool Nightswan, Eli responded that he was expecting to be challenged but admitted that he did not expect to meet Cygni again. When Eli asked what Nightswan was doing with a bunch of "crazies", Nightswan responded that he was helping to bring about the fall of the "corrupt" Empire.<ref name="Thrawn" />

Nightswan admitted that he had engineered the Scrim Island incident in order to kill Thrawn after failing to destroy him politically. Eli misled Nightswan into believing that Thrawn was commanding the ill-fated 103rd Task Force above. With Nightswan believing that he had finally laid a trap for Thrawn, Vanto flattered the insurgent leader in order to obtain information. Nightswan revealed that he had learn from one of his contacts that Thrawn had fought alongisde the Jedi General Anakin Skywalker at the [[Thrugii asteroid belt]] during the Clone Wars. Shortly later, one of Nightswan's insurgents who was searching the freighter ''Slipknot'' discovered a [[radiation]] leak in the engine compartment. Eli realized that Thrawn was staging a diversion to escape.<ref name="Thrawn" />

Shortly later, the engine compartment exploded. Realizing that Thrawn had given the signal, Eli pressed the innermost tile on his tunic, causing the hold-out blaster to explode. With Nightswan distracted, Eli fought his way back into the bay. With the insurgents distracted, Eli and Thrawn escaped aboard a stolen freighter. After reuniting aboard the cockpit, Eli asked Thrawn why they were stealing one of the insurgents' freighter instead of escaping on their own. Thrawn replied that he wanted to obtain navigational records of bases and supply lines from the ship's computer. Eli's meeting with Nightswan had merely been a distraction. Thrawn also confided that he had escaped the exploding ''Slipknot'' by ejecting in an [[escape pod]].<ref name="Thrawn" />

After returning to Batonn, Vanto learned that Thrawn had ordered Captain Bento to coordinate the remaining light cruisers in the 103rd Task Force to evacuate the ''Judicator'' with their [[tractor beam]]s. With Admiral Durril discredited and other Imperial forces dealing with the insurgents on Sammun and [[Denash]], Admiral Thrawn was tasked with neutralizing the rebel insurgents on Scrim Island.<ref name="Thrawn" />

====Victory on Scrim Island====
Under Thrawn's command, the 96th Task Force converged above Scrim Island to pacify the insurgents. Prior to the assault, Commander Vanto chatted with Commander Faro and confirmed that he had spent his entire career serving under Thrawn. Faro complimented Eli for keeping Thrawn "sane" while serving under Imperial commanders who had been appointed to their posts because of their personal connections as opposed to their abilities. Faro also assured Vanto that Thrawn had been right that he was cut out to be more than a supply officer. Thrawn also reassured Commander Faro that Thrawn's plan would work and that the other command staff in the 96th Task Force would be able to follow them. While aboard the ''Chimaera'', Eli was present when Admiral Thrawn ordered the light cruisers ''Shyrack'', ''[[Flensor]]'', and the ''[[Tumnor]]'' to enter Batonn's upper atmosphere and bombard Scrim Island.<ref name="Thrawn" />

While the light cruisers engaged the three turbolasers, a hidden fourth turbolaser unleashed salvos that weakened the three ships. However, Thrawn had prepared for this and ordered the light cruisers to shift to their new assigned positions. With the insurgents' fourth turbolaser inoperative due to faulty supply parts, Thrawn repositioned the ''Chimaera'' behind the damaged ''Flensor''. As this was taking place, Eli explained to Faro that the insurgent commander had figured out that if his ion cannons could not hit the ''Chimaera'', the ''Chimaera'' could not disable his ion cannons. Eli also realized that Thrawn wanted to trick the insurgents into thinking they could fire their fourth turbolaser cannon once the ''Chimaera'' was in position.<ref name="Thrawn" />

Since Thrawn had moved the cruisers and the ''Chimaera'' to a safe position in orbit, the insurgents' ion cannons were unable to hit their ships. As the Imperial ships entered Batonn's atmosphere, Thrawn ordered them to open fire on the oceans surrounding Scrim. This bombardment triggered a tsunami that hit the ion cannon, turbolaser emplacements, and shield generator, knocking them out of action. With their weapons and shield down, the insurgent leader on Scrim Island sues for peace. Thrawn orders Commander Vanto to inform Coruscant that Scrim Island has been retaken. Despite the victory, Thrawn warns Vanto and Faro that the Battle of Batonn has not yet been won.<ref name="Thrawn" />

====Dealing with Pryce and Yularen====
During the first assault on Scrim Island, several insurgent freighters had fled to different locations on Batonn's main continent. Commander Vanto was able to identify their shipping vectors and tracked down their cargoes to the [[Creekpath Mining and Refining complex]] outside [[Paeragosto City]] on the continent. The Batonn insurgents had taken up shelter within the mining complex's fortified mine. In response, the Empire and their [[Batonn Defense Force]] allies lay [[Siege of the Creekpath Mining and Refining complex|siege]] to the complex. Vanto was present when Governor Pryce and Colonel Yularen arrived aboard the ''Chimaera''. Since Pryce's parents lived in the Creekpath complex, she managed to persuade Yularen and Thrawn that she could assist the Empire by collecting intelligence on the insurgents' defenses and weapons setup. For the mission, Pryce would be accompanied by the ISB Agent [[Gudry]], who would be spying on the insurgents under the pretext of finding a friend.<ref name="Thrawn" />

Under Thrawn's orders, Vanto worked with Colonel Yularen on providing the frequencies and passwords that Pryce and Gudry needed. While heading to the hangar bay, Yularen instructed Eli to keep an encrypted ISB [[datacard]] isolated from the rest of the ship's computer system. Eli briefed Yularen about Thrawn's plan to deploy ground forces as soon as Pryce and her escort had found their way out. When the two were alone, Yularen questioned Eli whether Thrawn had set up the position of the ''Chimaera'' and the rest of the task force. When Vanto confirmed that this was the case, Yularen commented that the three light cruisers were positioned at the corners of an equilateral triangle nearly a 100 km across. Yularen feared that the ships were too far to assist each other.<ref name="Thrawn" />

Vanto replied that the light cruisers were not fit for battle. Yularen likened the light cruisers to "bell-up turtles" that would be easy prey for an attack force. Eli responded that once the ships were repaired they would come in sequence and give the ''Chimaera'' enough time to turn its turbolasers towards one cruiser before the second was attacked. When Yularen questioned Thrawn's tactics, Eli reassured him that Thrawn knew what he was doing. Yularen also expressed concern that Thrawn was becoming obsessed with Nightswan. Eli responded that Thrawn was in his right mind and that he had the good of the Empire in mind. Before leaving, Yularen instructed Eli to keep an eye on the Admiral.<ref name="Thrawn" />

On Batonn, Yularen found Thrawn after the Admiral had met with the insurgent leader Nightswan in a failed attempt to convince him to end the [[Batonn insurgency]] by offering him a place with the [[Chiss Ascendancy]]. Using the information he had acquired from Eli about Thrawn's tactics, Yularen questioned Thrawn about the positions of his ships. Thrawn reassured Yularen that the light cruisers' hyperdrives were still working, based on what Vanto had deduced from the repair logs. Thrawn also reassured Yularen that the light cruisers were not vulnerable and hinted that he had set a trap for any attackers.<ref name="Thrawn" />

====Thrawn's "Belly-up Turtles"====
In Thrawn's absence, Commander Vanto estimated that thirty armed mid-sized insurgent ships had escaped Denash and were hiding in the [[Batonn system]]. Eli reported his findings to Commander Faro, who deployed the ''Chimaera''{{'s}} TIE fighters above the planet. After Thrawn returned, the Admiral ordered the ''Chimaera'' to descend into Batonn's atmosphere so that they could bombard the insurgent stronghold once Gudry had deactivated the shields. As the ''Chimaera'' descended into Batonn's atmosphere, thirty insurgent ships approached the cruisers in three vectors. While Eli was startled, he maintained his composure and trusted Thrawn's leadership. When Thrawn remarked that his tactics would now face the test of battle, Eli asked whether they were going to die.<ref name="Thrawn" />

[[File:Thrawn 6 Batonn Space battle.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The ''Chimaera'' and the cruisers fire on the insurgent ships]]
When Thrawn ordered [[Senior Lieutenant]] [[Lomar]] to inform the cruisers to detach from their repair barges, Eli expressed surprise since he had thought that Thrawn had planned to order them to jump into hyperspace before they could open fire. Thrawn replied that he had used the light cruisers to mislead Nightswan. After the drone barges had pulled away from the light cruisers, Vanto and the others watched as the barges deployed three squadrons of TIE fighters. The TIE fighters ambushed the attacking insurgent ships. When Vanto asked where the TIE fighters had come from, Thrawn replied that Admiral Durril had loaned the ''Judicator''{{'s}} TIE fighters. Eli watched as the TIE fighters and ''Chimaera''{{'s}} turbolasers wiped out the insurgent fleet.<ref name="Thrawn" />

The Imperial victory was however soured by news that an explosion had destroyed both the insurgents' stronghold and many civilian homes. While Eli and the other Imperials believed that the insurgents had blown themselves up in a suicidal last stand, Pryce had in fact been responsible for the explosion. She had detonated Gudry's explosives in order to cover up his murder. Pryce had killed Gudry after he refused to evacuate her parents [[Talmoor Pryce|Talmoor]] and [[Elainye Pryce]]. Eli was present when Thrawn ordered Imperial forces to search and rescue survivors. Thrawn also gave orders for the Imperial forces to allow the fleeing insurgent ships to escape but to destroy those that wanted to fight.<ref name="Thrawn" />

===Emissary to the Chiss===
{{Quote|It is said that one should keep one's allies within view, and one's enemies within reach. A valid statement. One must be able to read an ally's strengths, so as to determine how to best use them. One must similarly be able to read his enemy's weaknesses, so as to determine how to best defeat him. But what of friends? There is no accepted answer, perhaps true friendship is so exceedingly rare. But I had formulated my own. A friend need not be kept within sight or within reach. A friend must be allowed the freedom to find and follow his own path. If one is fortunate, those paths will for a time join. But if paths separate, it is comforting to know that a friend still graces the universe with his skills, and his viewpoint, and his presence. For if one is remembered by a friend, one is never truly gone.|Thrawn, on Eli|Thrawn (novel)}}
Following the defeat of the Batonn insurgency, Admiral Thrawn spoke with Commander Vanto after his meeting with Governor Pryce. When Thrawn revealed that Pryce had offered up her services as his adviser on political matters, Vanto opined that Pryce was unsuitable for the job and asked about her role in the Creekpath bombing. Despite her denials, Thrawn believed that Pryce bore some responsibility for the disaster, which had killed many civilians. While the two agreed that they had insufficient evidence to prove Pryce's guilt, Thrawn remarked that there was "often a symmetry to things." Since Thrawn had been invited to Coruscant over his success in suppressing the Batonn insurgents, Vanto advised his mentor to smile and act gracefully. After exchanging pleasantries, Vanto headed to Batonn to salvage data from the Creekpath site.<ref name="Thrawn" />

[[File:Vanto and Aralani.png|thumb|right|250px|Vanto is greeted by Admiral Ar'alani.]]
After meeting with the Emperor and [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], Thrawn was promoted to the rank of [[Grand Admiral]]. Realizing Eli's potential and talents, Grand Admiral Thrawn dispatched the promising Commander into the Unknown Regions to serve as an Imperial liaison to the [[Chiss Ascendancy]]. Thrawn also presumably revealed that his exile had been a ruse and that he had established contact with the Empire with the full blessing of the Chiss Ascendancy. While traveling through hyperspace to the coordinates, Vanto read through [[Thrawn's journal]], which Thrawn had given to him as a token of their friendship. Upon arriving at the coordinates provided by Thrawn, he sighted a large alien ship. Vanto was contacted on the comm screen by Admiral [[Ar'alani]] of the [[Chiss Defense Fleet]]. Vanto identified himself and told her that Mitth'raw'nuruodo had sent him because he believed that he could help the Chiss Ascendancy. Ar'alani welcomed Eli to the Chiss Ascendancy.<ref name="Thrawn" />

==Personality and traits==
Growing up in the Wild Space frontier region, Eli Vanto was raised by his parents on legends of the blue-skinned Chiss species. While Vanto initially accepted his destiny of becoming a supply officer in the Imperial Navy, the Chiss warrior Thrawn realized that Vanto had the talents and potential to become an able commander. While the young Vanto was initially wary of serving as Thrawn's translator and aide due to his childhood perceptions of the Chiss as fearsome warriors, the two men came to respect each other as friends and comrades in the service of the Galactic Empire. Vanto came to regard Thrawn as his mentor and friend while Thrawn regarded Eli as one of the few loyal and trustworthy friends he could confide in.<ref name="Thrawn" />

While Vanto was loyal to the Empire, he was not blind to the Empire's flaws and shortcomings. Vanto recognized that the Imperial establishment was [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] towards alien species and that it privileged Core Worlders over the inhabitants of the frontier regions. Vanto objected to the enslavement of Wookiees on moral grounds and doubted Thrawn's rationalization that they were indentured workers. Due to his close association with Thrawn and his Wild Space origins, Vanto was continually overlooked for promotion by [[Imperial High Command]]. Eli's loyalty to his friend Thrawn led him to rebuff a lucrative job offer from Moff Ghadi's aide Culper despite threats that his career would be derailed. Despite his frustrations, Vanto's services was eventually acknowledged and he was subsequently promoted to the ranks of Lieutenant Commander and Commander.<ref name="Thrawn" />

During his Imperial Naval service, Vanto came to appreciate Thrawn's unorthodox tactics and tendency to defy Imperial military protocol. Occasionally, Eli acted as voice of caution in instances when Thrawn "threaded on the toes" of the Imperial military hierarchy. While Vanto participated in the Empire's counterinsurgency efforts against the growing rebellion, he did not use excessive violence and force.<ref name="Thrawn" />

==Skills and abilities==
Since his family was involved in shipping and trading, Eli was familiar with starship systems. He was also fluent in both [[Galactic Basic]] and the [[Sy Bisti]] trade language. As an Imperial Navy officer, Vanto was well versed in Imperial military protocol and tactics. He was also competent at unarmed combat and fought against Nightswan's insurgents in at least two occasions. At Thrawn's request, Vanto used his investigative skills to investigate the Empire's expropriation of large amounts of [[doonium]] and other precious metals. Due to Eli's efforts, Thrawn discovered that the Empire was building a [[superweapon]] known as the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]].<ref name="Thrawn" />

==Behind the scenes==
Eli Vanto first appeared as the [[Wikipedia:Deuteragonist|deuteragonist]] of [[Timothy Zahn]]'s [[2017]] novel ''[[Thrawn (novel)|Thrawn]]'' which serves as a [[canon]]ical origins story of the titular character. During an interview published on [[StarWars.com]], Zahn described Eli as a character whose chosen track had been disrupted by Thrawn's entry into his life. Zahn characterized the novel as a journey for Eli and Thrawn, with the former coming to terms with his distrust, resentments, and apprehensions of the latter.<ref name="Zahn April 2017 interview">{{SW|url=news/timothy-zahn-star-wars-thrawn-novel-interview|text=Timothy Zahn on His Novel ''Thrawn'', How to Pronounce the Grand Admiral's Full Name, and More}}</ref>
