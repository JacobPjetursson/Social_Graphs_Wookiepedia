'''Lumat''' was one of the many [[Ewok/Legends|Ewoks]] who helped the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebellion]] defeat the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] in the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]]. He was the husband of [[Zephee/Legends|Zephee]] and the father of [[Latara]], [[Nippet/Legends|Nippet]], and [[Wiley]]. He was the chief woodcutter for his tribe.

==Behind the scenes==
Lumat was made into an action figure by [[Kenner Products|Kenner]] in [[1984]]. Upon his initial release, he was in a ''Return of the Jedi'' package with a bow, a quiver, and a hood. The second release, on Power of the Force packaging, added a coin to his accessories.

In 2012 Lumat received his second figure in the vintage collection line, now sporting a unique headsculpt, bow, and arrows as part of an online-only release because stores couldn't take another wave of figures due to poor distribution on its figure line. This figure can actually hold the bow and arrow like it is about to shoot a fleeing stormtrooper.

While the action figure shows Lumat to be an Ewok with solid brown/gray fur, his [[Star Wars Customizable Card Game|Customizable Card Game]] (CCG) card pictured [[Graak]], another prominent Ewok with black and gray striped fur.

Hasbro's Graak figure, released in 2007, is based on the 1984 Lumat action figure, though bears Graak's black and gray colors, matching that of the "Lumat" CCG card.

"[[Rogues Gallery (Star Wars Insider)|Rogues Gallery]]" in ''[[Star Wars Insider 135]]'' established that Lumat was indeed the Ewok from the Kenner figure and not the CCG card.

Lumat can be seen in the Special Edition DVD of ''[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]'' at frame 1:12:32.
