'''Lux Bonteri''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] [[senator]] and [[Onderon rebels|rebel fighter]] from [[Onderon]] during the [[Clone Wars]]. He was the son of the late [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist]] senator [[Mina Bonteri]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Lux Bonteri was the son of [[Onderon]]'s<ref name="A War on Two Fronts" /> [[senator]], [[Mina Bonteri]], and her [[Mina Bonteri's husband|husband]].<ref name="Heroes on Both Sides" />

===The Clone Wars===
After the formation of the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]], Bonteri and his family sided with the Separatists when Onderon joined the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Bonteri and his family moved to the planet [[Raxus]], the capital of the Confederacy, where his mother was a member of the [[Separatist Senate]]. Some time after Onderon joined the Separatists, Bonteri's father, an [[officer]] in the [[Confederacy military]] was [[Death|killed]] while setting up a base on [[Aargonar]] after an [[Battle of Aargonar (Clone Wars)|attack]] by [[Galactic Republic|Republic]] [[clone trooper]]s early in the [[Clone Wars]].<ref name="Heroes on Both Sides" />

====Initiative for peace====
{{Quote|Well, I mean, you think we're all the bad guys. But how many of us have ''you'' actually met? And droids don't count.''"<br />"''Well, other than military officers like Grievous and Ventress&hellip; none, I guess. You and your mother are the first.''"<br />"''Well, look at me. Am I so bad?|Lux Bonteri and Ahsoka Tano, in a discussion of perspectives|Heroes on Both Sides}}
[[File:BonteriEstate-HOBS.png|thumb|left|300px|Bonteri and Tano discuss their biases about the Clone Wars.]]
During the Clone Wars, Bonteri was present when the Republic Senator [[Padmé Amidala]] and [[Jedi]] [[Padawan]] [[Ahsoka Tano]] traveled to Raxus to speak with his mother about negotiating a peace treaty between the Confederacy and the Republic. While his mother and Amidala negotiated, Bonteri and Tano conversed outside in the garden. Both spoke of their biased perspectives of the war; Bonteri confessed his distrust of the Jedi and the Republic, and Tano spoke of her distrust of the Separatists. Bonteri had never met a Jedi before while Ahsoka had never met a Separatist civilian, and they mutually agreed that they were in fact not that different from each other. Despite being on opposing sides of the war, the two quickly became friends.<ref name="Heroes on Both Sides" />

Concluding her discussion with Amidala, Mina Bonteri initiated a motion in the Separatist Senate to begin [[Confederate–Republic peace initiative|peace negotiations]] with the [[Galactic Senate|Republic Senate]]. The vote passed with a majority, and Amidala and Tano returned to [[Coruscant]]. However, [[Count]] [[Dooku]], the Separatist [[Head of State]] and secretly [[Sith Lord]], needed the war to continue for the sake of the [[Sith]]. Dooku orchestrated a Separatist [[Bombing of Coruscant's central power distribution grid|attack]] on Coruscant, causing the Republic Senate to vote against peace negotiations with the Separatists. Dooku also secretly ordered the assassination of Mina Bonteri, publicly blaming her death on the Republic.<ref name="Pursuit of Peace">{{TCW|Pursuit of Peace}}</ref> The murder of his mother left Lux an orphan, and he refused to believe that the Republic ordered her death.<ref name="A Friend in Need" />

====Confronting Dooku====
Believing that it was Dooku that was responsible for the death of his mother, Bonteri sought out the [[Mandalorian]] [[Death Watch]] led by former Separatist ally, [[Pre Vizsla]]. Like Bonteri, Vizsla also desired revenge on Dooku after Death Watch's attempt to take over [[Mandalore]] fell through, resulting in Dooku withdrawing his support of the organization.<ref name="Duchess of Mandalore">{{TCW|Duchess of Mandalore}}</ref> Together, Bonteri and Vizsla planned to track Dooku down using a [[holotrace device]] and then, with knowledge of his location, Death Watch would help Bonteri assassinate Dooku.<ref name="A Friend in Need" />

[[File:BonteriConfrontsDooku-FIN.png|thumb|right|300px|Bonteri confronts Dooku, accusing Dooku for the murder of his mother.]]
During a [[Confederate–Republic peace conference|peace conference]] between the Confederacy and the Republic on Mandalore, a [[Council of Neutral Systems|neutral system]], Bonteri burst into the meeting uninvited and publicly accused Dooku of his mother's murder. This alarmed many of those present at the conference, including Republic Senator Padmé Amidala as well as Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano, who was serving as Amidala's personal bodyguard. Separatist Congress Leader [[Bec Lawise]] ordered for Bonteri's arrest, and [[BX-series droid commando|security droids]] removed him from the room. The [[droid]]s brought Bonteri before Dooku via [[hologram]], where Bonteri discreetly used his holotrace device in order to discover the location of Dooku's transmission. Dooku, unaware of Bonteri's holotrace device, denied his involvement in Mina Bonteri's death and ordered Bonteri to be executed for treason. Before the droids could kill Bonteri, Tano entered and saved Bonteri from the droids, having followed him since he left the meeting. Tano took Bonteri to the ''[[Phoenix (GX1 short hauler)|Phoenix]]'', accompanied by [[R2-D2]], where she contacted [[Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker]], who told her to bring Bonteri to Coruscant. Bonteri refused, insisting that he had plans to deal with Dooku with the help of the Death Watch. Learning of his desire to kill Dooku, Tano advised him not to, and began to take the ''Phoenix'' to Coruscant. However Bonteri, adamant about his decision, knocked out Tano, hiding her lightsabers and taking her to [[Carlac]] in order to meet with Death Watch.<ref name="A Friend in Need" />

====Welcome to Death Watch====
[[File:BonterixTanoFUREVER.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Bonteri silences Tano's anti–Death Watch objections from Pre Vizsla and Bo-Katan Kryze]]
Once on Carlac, Bonteri planned to meet with Death Watch alone and leave Tano on the ship, however when Tano woke up she instructed R2 to find her lightsabers and hold on to them for her, so that she could hide her true identity from Death Watch. Just as Tano met up with Bonteri outside of their ship, the pair was greeted by [[Bo-Katan Kryze]], Pre Vizsla's second in command, who took them to the Death Watch camp to meet with Vizsla. Tano, pretending to be engaged to Bonteri, told Bonteri not to trust the Death Watch because of their terrorist ideology, but Bonteri refused to listen to her. When brought before Vizsla, Bonteri provided him with the holotrace device, and Vizsla invited Bonteri to a feast to celebrate their success. Bonteri obliged, and the celebration took place with Tano acting as a servant, alongside several [[Ming Po]] women who had been captured by the Death Watch. The celebration was interrupted, however, when Chieftian [[Pieter]] of the nearby Ming Po village demanded that Vizsla return the women that the Death Watch had taken from them.<ref name="A Friend in Need" />

[[File:WelcomeToDeathWatch-FIN.png|thumb|right|300px|Bonteri watches as Death Watch destroys the Ming Po village.]]
Surprisingly, Vizsla agreed, promising Pieter he would return the women to the village the next day, and Bonteri took this as a sign that the Death Watch had honor and were not terrorists as Tano had warned him. However, the truth was revealed when the next day Vizsla and his soldiers brought the women back to the village, only to kill Pieter's granddaughter [[Tryla]] in front of him and proceed to burn down the village. With the innocent Ming Po in danger, Tano revealed her true identity as a Jedi when she attacked the Death Watch soldiers in order to protect the Ming Po people, and was subsequently captured by the Death Watch.<ref name="A Friend in Need" />

Bonteri and Tano were taken prisoner by the Death Watch, and Bonteri realized that Tano had been right when Lux saw that Vizsla planned to execute Tano for the Jedi's crimes against Mandalore. However, R2-D2 entered the tent and created a distraction, allowing Bonteri to escape while Tano engaged Vizsla in [[lightsaber combat]]. Outside the tent, Bonteri discovered many [[battle droid]]s that the Death Watch had been using for target practice turn on their masters after being reassembled by R2. With the droid's assistance, Tano and Bonteri were able to escape the Death Watch on the ''Phoenix''. Tano again wanted to take Bonteri to Coruscant, but Bonteri again refused, headed toward the ship's [[escape pod]]. Tano tried to stop him, but Bonteri said he needed to find his own way, hoping that they would see each other again. Departing on good terms, Bonteri detached the pod and left Tano to go into hiding.<ref name="A Friend in Need" />

====Revolution of Onderon====
[[File:RebelsAndTheCouncil-AWOTF.png|thumb|left|300px|Bonteri and Saw Gerrera contact the Jedi Council for help.]]
Eventually, Bonteri returned to his homeworld of Onderon, which was under Separatist occupation. The Separatist regime had made [[Sanjay Rash]] King of Onderon, and removed the true King, [[Ramsis Dendup]]. Bonteri joined a [[Onderon rebels|resistance group]] that had been formed by [[Steela Gerrera|Steela]] and [[Saw Gerrera]] with the goal of returning Dendup to the throne. In order for their mission to be successful, however, the rebels required supplies, weapons, and training. Using his personal connection to Ahsoka Tano to his advantage, Bonteri contacted the [[Jedi High Council]], asking for aid to help restore peace to Onderon. The Jedi promised to help, however many were resistant to becoming directly involved in the matter, saying that it was an internal affair and out of their control. Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker suggested that the Jedi provide supplies and training to the rebels, but not directly become involved in the fight; allowing the rebels to retake their homeworld on their own. Agreeing with this idea, the Council sent Jedi [[General]]s [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and Anakin Skywalker, accompanied by Commander Ahsoka Tano and Clone Captain [[Rex|CT-7567]], known as "Rex", to Onderon where they began to train the rebels for combat.<ref name="A War on Two Fronts" />

Upon arrival to Onderon, Kenobi, Skywalker, Tano, and Rex were brought to the rebel camp and began to train the rebels. The rebels began by learning to disable [[Armored Assault Tank]]s and [[droideka]]s using [[Electro Magnetic Pulse grenade|grenades]]. Bonteri was particularly good as disarming the droidekas, however when paired with Saw to take out the tank, he fell off the tank taking Saw down with him. This caused Saw to be upset with Bonteri, claiming that he was a politician and not meant to fight. Both Steela and Saw could not disable the droidekas, and Steela became frustrated with herself, preferring her skills as a [[sniper]] to destroy droids.<ref name="A War on Two Fronts" />

While practicing their marksmanship with the Jedi, a group of battle droids, learning the location of the rebel base, began to attack the rebels. Using their new training, the rebels took out the first wave of battle droids using grenades. However, the second wave of battle droids arrived with a tank, which Bonteri and Saw had been unsuccessful disarming in training. Bonteri and Saw paired up again to take out the tank, and this time succeeded, using [[thermal detonator]]s and destroying the tank. After succeeding in defending their base, the Jedi and the rebels decided that they were ready to take the fight to [[Iziz]] and reclaim Onderon. In order to get into the Separatist controlled city, Bonteri came up with the idea of posing as hunters, coming back into Iziz to sell their game in the market. Not detecting any of their weaponry due to the high amounts of organic matter on their carts, the battle droids allowed the rebels to enter. After entering Iziz, the group split up to avoid attention; agreeing to regroup after nightfall.<ref name="A War on Two Fronts" />
[[File:RebelsInspectGenerator-FR.png|thumb|right|220px|Steela, Bonteri, and Tano inspect the power generator complex from an adjacent rooftop.]]
The group decided to execute a series of small strikes on battle droid battalions throughout the city, where Bonteri hid behind a market stand and disables a patrol of droids in front of some citizens. When the rebels later met up in a safehouse in Iziz, Saw suggested that they increase their attacks on the Separatists. However, it was noted that many of the civilians in Iziz had become frightened by the sudden outbreak of violence, and it was suggested by Bonteri and Steela that they first must win the trust of the people. Bonteri suggested that they take on a large target to show their strength and draw public attention to themselves. It was decided that they would attack the city power generator. Skywalker, Kenobi, and Rex left the rebels and returned to Couruscant, while Tano remained as an advisor to the rebels.<ref name="Front Runners">{{TCW|Front Runners}}</ref>

Eventually, after some time training, Bonteri, Tano and the Onderon rebels&mdash;led by Steela&mdash;made their presence known to the people in Iziz and fought against the droid army, forcing them to retreat. Onderon was won, Dendup became king again, and Bonteri&mdash;having his faith placed in the Jedi and the Republic&mdash;was appointed Senator of Onderon. He swore to serve the Republic.<ref name="Tipping Points" />

===The Mentor===
After the [[Proclamation of the New Order|rise]] of the [[Galactic Empire]], Bonteri married [[Lux Bonteri's wife|an Imperial]] and became a father to her [[Lux Bonteri's stepdaughter|daughter]]. Bonteri's goddaughter [[Maia (Partisan)|Maia]] became a member of Saw's [[Partisans]]<ref name="Inferno Squad" /> and was killed whilst on a [[Mission to Inusagi|mission]] to the [[Mid Rim]] planet [[Inusagi]].<ref name="Rebel Rising">''[[Rebel Rising]]''</ref> Bonteri eventually became a member of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] and following Saw's death during the [[Destruction of Jedha City|destruction]] of [[Jedha City]], Bonteri contacted his stepdaughter saying Saw's death had upset him more than he could have realized and asked that in return for giving the Empire all he had on the operations of the Rebel Alliance, he wanted amnesty. His stepdaughter gave him specific times and locations where he could hand himself in but instead of turning himself in, Bonteri contacted [[Staven]], the leader of the [[Dreamers]], joined the group becoming known as "the Mentor" and used the information from his stepdaughter to give Staven a constant supply of Imperial targets to hit.<ref name="Inferno Squad" />

After the Imperial [[Captain]] [[Iden Versio]], who had [[Infiltration of the Dreamers|infiltrated]] the Dreamers along with her [[special forces]] [[Inferno Squad|team members]], revealed that she intended to kill Bonteri in order to recover the stolen information in his possession, he entreated Versio to always have hope before she fired. Instead of killing him, Versio had instead stunned him, leaving her to question his whereabouts.<ref name="Inferno Squad" />
