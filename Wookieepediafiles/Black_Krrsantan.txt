{{Quote|You're Black Krrsantan. The infamous Wookiee bounty hunter. I've heard of you. I know why you were forced to leave Kashyyyk. And how you've disgraced your people ever since. Jabba hired you, didn't he?|Obi-Wan Kenobi, to Black Krrsantan|Star Wars 20: From the Journals of Old Ben Kenobi}}
'''Black Krrsantan''', also known as "'''Santy'''", was a [[Sexes|male]] [[Wookiee]] [[bounty hunter]] during the [[Galactic Civil War]]. He was a regular bounty hunter for the [[crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the [[Hutt]] and was [[Attack on Cymoon 1#Aftermath|hired]] by [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] to track down and capture an [[Cylo|agent]] of the [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]].

==Biography==
===Trained to be a gladiator===
{{Quote|Ok Noka, they'll do. One question, why isn't the Wookiee in chains?''"<br />"''He volunteered.|One of the Xonti Brothers and Noka|Doctor Aphra Annual 1}}
Early in [[Sexes|his]] life, Black Krrsantan disgraced his [[Wookiee|people]]. Krrsantan was keen to flee [[Kashyyyk]] because of this and he learnt that an acquisition crew, that captured aliens for the [[Xonti Brothers]], was coming to Kashyyyk. Krrsantan set a trap for them by leaving an unconscious Wookiee as bait. When the five [[Trandoshan]]s took the bait, Krrsantan opened fired on them, killing one of the slavers. The others opened fired and Krrsantan gunned down two more of them, pinning down the last two, [[Noka]] and [[Kootan]]. Kootan attempted to kill Krrsantan when the Wookiee swung at him and threw him into a tree, killing the Trandoshan on impact. Krrsantan stood over Noka and ordered the slaver to take him to the Xonti Brothers. Noka put him with the other four aliens he had captured, a [[Talz]], a [[Herglic]], a [[Gamorrean]] and a [[Dowutin]].<ref name="Doctor Aphra Annual">''[[Doctor Aphra Annual 1]]''</ref>

Noka took them to the Xonti Brothers, who were surprised the Wookiee had volunteered. Krrsantan soon realized he chose wrong when they put him through harsh training against his will to be a gladiator. The five candidates were pushed and pushed and the Xonti Brothers started picking them off. The Talz fell first to a [[sarlacc]]. Then the Gamorrean was killed by a large monster. The Herglic fell later to a swarm of robotic insects. This left Krrsantan and the Dowutin. The Xonti Brothers altered the wookiee's knuckles by filling them with metal to make them better when punching. Krrsantan tested it on the Dowutin and knocked it unconscious in one punch. He was then auctioned to the highest bidder. Krrsantan swore to affect the Xonti Brothers in the same way they had affected him.<ref name="Doctor Aphra Annual" />

===Working for Jabba the Hutt===
====Tracking Kenobi====
[[File:Star Wars 20 textless cover.png|right|thumb|250px|Black Krrsantan vs Obi-Wan Kenobi]]
Sometime later, Krrsantan became a [[bounty hunter]] for the [[crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the [[Hutt]] who resided on the [[desert]] [[planet]] [[Tatooine]].<ref name="Star Wars 20" /> In [[10 BBY]], Krrsantan was hired by Jabba to track down the [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|man]] who stopped his [[water tax]].<ref name="Star Wars 15">''[[Star Wars 15: From the Journals of Old Ben Kenobi]]''</ref> He went to the location of the attack in the [[Dune Sea]] with [[Pagetti Rook]] and a [[Klatooinian]] guard. Krrsantan went to the [[Lars moisture farm|moisture farm]] nearby and took [[Owen Lars]] hostage. Krrsantan then made Lars scream. He then saw the man, "Ben" Kenobi appear behind him. He was given a chance to leave by Kenobi. Krrsantan fought Kenobi, choking him and trapping him with a [[stun net]]. Lars fought back against Krrsantan but was easily knocked aside. Kenobi used [[the Force]] to cause rocks to hit Krrsantan and save Lars from falling. He then tried to [[Death|kill]] Kenobi with a rock. Krrsantan was briefly blinded and scarred by Kenobi's [[Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber (Jedi Master)|lightsaber]]. He tried to shoot Kenobi with his [[electrified net gun]], but it was destroyed. Krrsantan then punched and tried to kill Kenobi, as Kenobi attempted to rescue Lars. He continued trying to kill him with his [[bowcaster]] until he fell off the side of a cliff. Krrsantan then fled Tatooine, knowing that Jabba would be incensed at his failure.<ref name="Star Wars 20" />

====Hired by Vader====
[[File:Black Krrsantan AN.png|left|thumb|250px|Black Krrsantan in battle]]
Shortly after the [[Battle of Yavin]], [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] traveled to Tatooine on a [[Attack on Cymoon 1#Aftermath|mission]] to negotiate on behalf of the [[Galactic Empire]] for supplies with Jabba. Vader also used the opportunity to take on a personal mission, and he requested two [[bounty]] hunters from Jabba. The Hutt provided his two best bounty hunters, Krrsantan and [[Boba Fett]]. While Fett was to track down [[Luke Skywalker]], the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel]] who destroyed the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]] and who was secretly Vader's son, Krrsantan was hired to find and capture an [[Cylo|agent]] of the [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]]. Vader wanted this [[agent]], whose identity and purpose [[Darth Sidious]] did not reveal to the [[Dark Lord of the Sith|Dark Lord]], in order to find out why he was working for the Emperor.<ref name="Darth Vader 1" />

Krrsantan successfully tracked down Cylo and discovered that he was moving illegal [[alien]] parts to a [[Cylo's research base|secret base]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]]. The agent discovered Krrsantan was following him before he could find out where the base was or what he was doing for the Emperor. Krrsantan captured the agent and brought him to Vader aboard his [[Naboo Royal Starship|Nubian]] [[starship]], where he witnessed the agent, whose named was Cylo-IV, being killed by Vader's new [[torture]] [[droid]], [[0-0-0]], but not before providing the information Krrsantan had previously failed to acquire.<ref name="Darth Vader 4">''[[Darth Vader 4: Vader, Part IV]]''</ref>

===Working for Aphra===
Sometime after his contract for Vader expired, Krrsantan was summoned along with fellow bounty hunters [[Bossk]], [[IG-90]] and [[Beebox]] to a [[cantina]] on [[Son-tuul]] where, as he waited for his fellows, Krrsantan entered the cantina's [[fighting pit]]s, where captured Wookiees fought each other for the entertainment of the customers. Krrsantan strangled a fighter and took his place to become a contestant, becoming one of the only Wookiees to enter the pits willingly. The Wookiee bounty hunter won the fight by beating his opponent to death.<ref name="Darth Vader 7">''[[Darth Vader 7: Shadows and Secrets, Part I]]''</ref>

====Heist at Son-tuul====
After the fight, Krrsantan joined Beebox, Bossk and IG-90 in the cantina where they were approached by rogue [[archaeologist]] [[Chelli Lona Aphra|Aphra]], who had issued the summons. She told the assembled bounty hunters about her plans for a [[Son-tuul Pride robbery|heist]]: the Empire had just [[Destruction of the Son-tuul Pride|broken]] the criminal element known as the [[Son-tuul Pride]], which dominated Son-tuul's underworld. The fortune they had hoarded was in transit to the Imperial vaults. Aphra told the bounty hunters that she had inside information which would allow them to locate the [[transport]], circumvent the guards and get away, and that she was offering them a part in exchange for their services.<ref name="Darth Vader 7" />

Krrsantan then piloted his [[Black Krrsantan's Auzituck anti-slaver gunship|ship]] during Aphra's robbery near [[Anthan Prime]]. There, Krrsantan was able to use an asteroid to penetrate the [[Arquitens-class light cruiser|''Arquitens''-class light cruiser's]] [[hull]]. He and the others gathered what remained of the [[credit]]s aboard the [[cruiser]]. He and Aphra used the ship to collect the credits floating in space. He went with Aphra to [[Anthan 13]] where they met with [[Lord]] Vader for information on the people who cut him up.<ref name="Darth Vader 8" />

====Battle of Vrogas Vas====
[[File:Krrantan takes the blaster of Han.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Black Krrsantan take's Han Solo's pistol]]
Krrsantan then went to [[Vrogas Vas]], where he [[Battle of Vrogas Vas|attacked]] the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. He then went to confront [[Han Solo]] and Skywalker. However, then got into a fight with [[Chewbacca]].<ref name="Darth Vader 14">''[[Darth Vader 14: Vader Down, Part IV]]''</ref> During the fight, Krrsantan tossed Chewbacca at Solo. He was then shot with a [[needle]] by [[R2-D2]] and knocked down by Chewbacca. However, Krrsantan was able to knock Chewbacca out with [[Brass knuckles/Canon|brass knuckles]]. He then confronted Solo.<ref name="Star Wars 14">''[[Star Wars 14: Vader Down, Part V]]''</ref> After defeating Chewbacca, Krrsantan then grabbed Solo. However, [[C-3PO]] told him to stop his fighting. Krrsantan then knocked both himself and 3PO out.<ref name="Darth Vader 15">''[[Darth Vader 15: Vader Down, Part VI]]''</ref>

====Shu-Torun War====
Krrsantan survived the battle. He and several other bounty hunters were secretly hired by Vader to find Aphra; dead or alive.<ref name="Darth Vader 16">''[[Darth Vader 16: The Shu-Torun War, Part I]]''</ref> He then met up with Vader on Anthan 13 with a squad of [[BX-series droid commando|commando droids]].<ref name="Darth Vader 20">''[[Darth Vader 20: End of Games, Part I]]''</ref>

====Reuniting with Aphra====
Krrsantan, along with 0-0-0 and [[BT-1]] then went to [[Cosmatanic Steppes]] to [[Capture of Chelli Lona Aphra|retrieve]] Aphra.<ref name="Darth Vader 21">''[[Darth Vader 21: End of Games, Part II]]''</ref> He then took her to Lord Vader's new flagship, the ''[[Executor]]''.<ref name="Darth Vader 22">''[[Darth Vader 22: End of Games, Part III]]''</ref> He then [[Hijacking of the Executor|fought]] alongside Aphra and her droids against Cylo's forces. Krrsantan stayed with Aphra because she owed him money.<ref name="Darth Vader 23">''[[Darth Vader 23: End of Games, Part IV]]''</ref> After Vader retook the ''Executor'' and jettisoned Aphra into space, Krrsantan then rescued her from the vacuum of space.<ref name="Darth Vader 25">''[[Darth Vader 25: End of Games, Part VI]]''</ref>

==Personality and traits==
[[File:Black Krrsantan SWFC.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Black Krrsantan]]
Black Krrsantan was a male Wookiee. He had [[Color|black]] [[hair]] and brown [[eye]]s, with decorative [[gold]] material covering his chest, as well as gold ornaments in his hair. He had a scar across his left eye.<ref name="Darth Vader 1" /> He disgraced his people on [[Kashyyyk]], prompting him to get off world.<ref name="Star Wars 20" /> When he first heard of the Xonti Brothers, Krrsantan did not hesitate to try and get to them, going as far as killing most of a Trandoshan acquisition crew to get to them. The last Trandoshan, Noka, was surprised of Krrsantan's willingness to join. However, Krrsantan soon found out what he really signed up for and after harsh training as a gladiator, he swore a life debt on the Xonti Brothers, a pledge to affect them in the same way they had affected him.<ref name="Doctor Aphra Annual" /> Krrsantan eventually saw the Xonti Brothers again during the [[auction of Rur]], where he attempted to capture them. After the Auction ended in the deaths of many members, Krrsantan used it as his chance to capture the Xonti Brothers and he did, taking them back to their gladiatorial pits to fulfill the life debt.<ref name="Enormous Profit V">''[[Doctor Aphra 13: The Enormous Profit, Part V]]''</ref>

==Skills and abilities==
Black Krrsantan was harshly trained as a gladiator by the Xonti Brothers. It gave him exceptional skill in fighting, even though before he managed to take out most of a Trandoshan acquisition crew.<ref name="Doctor Aphra Annual" /> According to Boba Fett, Black Krrsantan was one of Jabba's best bounty hunters. The Wookiee had the ability to wield a bowcaster.<ref name="Darth Vader 1" /> He was good fighter even against his fellow Wookiees,<ref name="Darth Vader 7" /> such as Chewbacca. He would also use brass knuckles.<ref name="Star Wars 14" />
