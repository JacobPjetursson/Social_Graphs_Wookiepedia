On the orders of Amidala's chief of security, [[Captain]] [[Gregar Typho|Typho]], Cordé served as her decoy, traveling on the senator's [[J-type diplomatic barge|ship]] posing as Amidala while the real senator [[pilot]]ed a [[N-1 starfighter|Naboo starfighter]] in disguise. Upon landing, Cordé descended the ramp with her retinue, but was soon caught up in an [[Plot to assassinate Padmé Amidala|explosion]] that destroyed the [[Starship|ship]] and [[Death|killed]] both her and six other people. The explosion was set up by [[bounty hunter]] [[Zam Wesell]], who had been hired by [[Jango Fett]] to [[assassin]]ate the senator.<ref name="Episode II" />

While Cordé lay dying, Amidala ran to her [[Naboo Royal Handmaidens|handmaiden's]] side. With her dying words, Cordé apologized for failing her mistress, though Amidala insisted that she had not.<ref name="Episode II" /> Sometime later, Amidala shared private tears for Cordé with [[Duja]], another of her handmaidens.<ref name="Thrawn: Alliances">''[[Thrawn: Alliances]]''</ref>
