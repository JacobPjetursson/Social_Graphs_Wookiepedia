'''Yarna d'al' Gargan''' was a [[Sexes|female]] [[Askajian]] whose [[Parent|father]] was a tribal [[chief]] back on her [[homeworld]] of [[Askaji]]. Many [[Standard year|years]] prior to the [[Battle of Endor]], she was captured by [[slaver]]s and transported to the [[desert]] [[planet]] of [[Tatooine]], where the [[Hutt]] [[crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]] bought her. One of Jabba's many [[Slavery|slaves]], she served him as a dancing girl at [[Jabba's Palace|his palace]] on [[Tatooine]], often working alongside a young [[Twi'lek]] called [[Oola]]. She was present for Oola's execution, which horrified her, and the arrival of Luke Skywalker at the palace.

==Biography==
Yarna d'al' Gargan was the daughter of an Askajian tribal chief, the [[Marriage|wife]] of [[Nautag]], and the [[Parent|mother]] of four [[Youngling|cublings]]. On her [[homeworld]] of [[Askaji]], she would only dance for the honor of her tribe. One [[Standard day|day]], however, she and her family were captured by [[slaver]]s and brought to the [[desert]] planet of [[Tatooine]], where the [[Hutt]] [[crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]] bought them. When Nautag attempted to rebel, the Hutt fed him to his pet [[rancor]] [[Pateesa]], and Yarna's cublings were sent to his [[Desilijic Complex|townhouse]] in [[Mos Eisley]].<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" />

One of Jabba's many [[Slavery|slaves]], Yarna served him as an exotic dancing girl at [[Jabba's Palace|his palace]] in the [[Dune Sea]], often working alongside a young [[Twi'lek]] called [[Oola]].<ref name="DB Yarna" /> The Hutt was cruel with her, forcing the Askajian to enlarge her body to resemble a Hutt and wear make-up to make her look more like [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure's mother|his mother]]. Although she hated Jabba, Yarna managed to make friends with some of the palace regulars.<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" /> Eventually, the Hutt was strangled to [[death]] by [[Leia Organa]] near the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]], which effectively freed his slaves.<ref name="RotJ" /> That allowed Yarna to escape Jabba's palace and, at long last, reunite with her children.<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" />

==Behind the scenes==
Yarna d'al' Gargan was portrayed by [[Claire Davenport]] in [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]. During production of the movie, her character was known as Wiebba-wiebba.<ref name="Blog">{{Blog|official=true|2013/08/19/star-wars-mysteries-who-is-wiebba-wiebba/|''Star Wars'' Mysteries: Who is Wiebba-Wiebba?}}</ref> [[Pablo Hidalgo]] detailed this revelation on The Official Star Wars Blog in [[2013]]. [[Holocron continuity database]] keeper [[Leland Chee]] had however previously identified "[[Weeba Weeba]]" as the human Rancor keeper who wears apparel resembling that of [[Nizuc Bek/Legends|Nizuc Bek]] and [[Velken Tezeri/Legends|Velken Tezeri]] but is not conclusively one or the other.<ref name="Holocron">{{Blog|holocron|27/comments|Jabba's Skiff Guards|Keeper of the Holocron's Blog|Leland Chee|archivedate=20120504152912}}</ref>

[[Kenner Products]] considered selling an action figure of Yarna, but thought it would be inappropriate to have a six [[breast]]ed toy on the shelves, as parents would not buy that toy for their children because they could see it immoral.<ref name="io9">{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/9-star-wars-toys-that-were-canceled-before-anybody-coul-1723640150|title=9 Star Wars Toys That Were Canceled Before Anybody Could Buy Them|work=io9.gizmodo.com|date=2015-08-18|last=Whitbrook|first=James}}</ref> Later on [[2008]] an action figure was released.
