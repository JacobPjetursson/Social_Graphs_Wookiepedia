'''CT-782''', nicknamed '''Hevy''' due to [[Sexes|his]] expertise in the use of [[Blaster cannon|heavy weapons]], was a [[clone trooper]] who served in the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] during the [[Clone Wars]]. [[Cloning|Bred]] from the [[DNA|genetic]] [[Clone template|template]] of the [[bounty hunter]] [[Jango Fett]], Hevy trained on the [[planet]] [[Kamino]] as a [[clone cadet]] of [[Domino Squad]]. After completing his training, Hevy was deployed to the [[Rishi moon]] which was noted for its strategic location near the [[Kamino system]]. Seeking to destroy the [[Tipoca City|facilities]] that supplied the [[Republic military]] with clones, the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] [[Battle of the Rishi moon|attacked the Rishi outpost]], putting Hevy and his [[squad]] on the defensive. Aided by [[Clone Commander]] [[CC-2224|CC-2224 "Cody"]] and [[Clone Captain]] [[Rex|CT-7567 "Rex,"]] they attempted to retake [[Rishi Station]] but were outnumbered and outgunned. Armed with a [[Z-6 rotary blaster cannon]], Hevy confronted the Separatists alone, destroying dozens of [[battle droid]]s before falling to enemy [[blaster]] [[fire]]. Wounded but alive, Hevy triggered several explosives and thereby [[Death|sacrificed his life]] to alert the [[Galactic Republic]] to the Separatist presence on the [[moon]], ultimately delaying the Confederacy's [[Battle of Kamino|invasion of Kamino]].

==Biography==
===Training on Kamino===
{{Dialogue|Bric|Cut it out! If you two focused on fighting droids as much as you do fighting each other, you might stand a chance out there.|Echo|Sorry, Master Chief.|Hevy|Well, Master Chief, maybe our problems come from our training. I rather be taught by a Jedi than some mercenary bounty hunter.|Bric|Jedi don't have the time to train grunts like you! That's why they hired me!|attr=Echo and Hevy to Bric, on their insufficient training|src=Clone Cadets}}
[[File:Hevytatoo.png|thumb|left|250px|A facial tattoo distinguished CT-782 "Hevy" from the other clones of Jango Fett.]]
CT-782, who was later given the nickname Hevy, was created on [[Kamino]] along with all other [[clone trooper]]s. He served in the Grand Army of the Republic's [[Domino Squad]], a unit of [[clone cadet]]s during the early days of the [[Clone Wars]]. His fellow squad members were [[CT-4040|Cutup]], [[CT-1409|Echo]], [[CT-5555|Fives]], and [[CT-00-2010|Droidbait]].<ref name="Clone Cadets" />

The Domino Squad members were trained at [[Tipoca City]], Kamino's capital, under [[Siniteen]] [[bounty hunter]] [[Bric]]. Bric, fellow [[Arcona]] bounty hunter [[El-Les]], and [[Jedi Master]] [[Shaak Ti]] oversaw the clone cadets practice for their final test, the [[Citadel Challenge]]. The test placed the squad head-to-head with [[battle droid]]s. While the battle droids' weapons, as well as their own weapons, were non-lethal, no clone could be injured during one of the tests. Despite this, all clone cadet squads had to work as a team to successfully pass their test. For CT-782 and Domino Squad, however, the team rarely got along with each other.<ref name="Clone Cadets" />

During the final practice test, Domino Squad were engaging droids when CT-782 broke away from the group. Watching the group, Bric, El-Les, and Shaak Ti took concern of Domino's Squad's recklessness. Bric expressed the group's inability to work as a team and wanted to send them to Tipoca City's maintenance crew, where rejected clones went. As the combat simulation progressed, CT-782 kept disobeying orders and assumed the squad's leadership as his own. However, the droid forces began to overwhelm the clones, causing the squad to fail. With their practice test a failure, the crestfallen Domino Squad returned to their sleeping [[barracks]]. Once there, CT-782 took off his training helmet and threw it on the ground in frustration. He then told his squad members that he was getting the job done because he was "thinking like an [[Advanced Recon Commando|ARC trooper]]".<ref name="Clone Cadets" />

[[File:BricBreaksUpEchoHevy-CC.png|thumb|right|250px|Hevy experienced difficulty integrating into Domino Squad during his time as a clone cadet.]]
When Echo, who had a bad habit of repeating orders after they were already given, reminded him that ARC troopers follow orders, CT-782 mocked him by asking Echo to repeat himself. The two engaged in a brief hand-to-hand brawl until the fight was broken up by Bric. Bric berated the cadets by stating that they might stand a chance out in the field if they started fighting droids as much as they fought each other. Echo immediately acknowledged his master chief and apologized. CT-782, however, was not as easily intimidated. He then expressed his opinion on having a Jedi oversee his training instead of a paid mercenary. Bric harshly reminded the clone that Jedi didn't have the time to train cadets like him. The bounty hunter then told the whole squad that since they could not work together as a team, they were all a waste of his time.<ref name="Clone Cadets" />

====The Final Test====
[[File:CloneTrainingArmor-TCWs3BR1.png|thumb|left|250px|Domino Squad failed in their first attempt to pass the final test in their training.]]
The next day, Bric and El-Les rallied Domino Squad, as well as other clone cadet squads, for a meeting on a hanger platform. A few Advanced Recon Commando troopers, led by [[Colt|Clone Commander Colt]], followed by [[Havoc (ARC trooper)|Havoc]], were to watch the clone cadet's final simulator test. If one passed the test, the troopers within the squad would become battle-ready clone soldiers. Colt took interest with [[Bravo Squad (clone cadets)|Bravo Squad]], a unit of clone cadets that passed certain tests in "ARC trooper time". CT-782 and Domino Squad watched as the Bravo Squad passed the simulation with flying colors. Unimpressed, CT-782 claimed that they were better than Bravo Squad. When the simulator began for Domino Squad, they managed to pass certain parts of the simulation faster than their usual rate. As the other clones were taking cover, CT-782 cleared a path for them by destroying droids with his [[Z-6 rotary blaster cannon]]. When Droidbait broke away from the rest of the squad, a droid shot him in the back. Cutup noticed this and yelled for CT-782, though he wanted to leave his injured teammate behind and head for the citadel. Colt and El-Les noticed them leaving Droidbait, which forced them to stop the simulation test, causing CT-782 and Domino Squad to automatically fail the test.<ref name="Clone Cadets" />

====Rise of the Domino Squad====
{{Quote|You're always trying to be the anchor Hevy, you know, do it on your own.Well, maybe you should embrace the fact that you have a team. See, I never had that. But you need them, and they need you . Why carry such a heavy burden on your own when you have your brothers at your side  Hevy.''"<br />"''Hevy? Stop calling me that! We're just numbers, 99. Just numbers.''"<br />"''Not to me. To me, you've always had a name.|Hevy and 99|Clone Cadets}}
[[File:Epguide301.png|thumb|right|250px|After gaining a second chance, Hevy's squad passed the final test by working together as a team.]]
That night CT-782 attempted to leave the clone army after his team failed to pass the final test. Before he could however, he was approached by [[99]], a malformed maintenance clone whom the group had befriended. The deformed clone told CT-782 that, despite the clone cadet's differences, he should work together with his team. Since 99 was never given a chance to prove himself worthy as a clone trooper, CT-782 had that chance to do so. Throughout the conversation, 99 kept calling CT-782, " Hevy," which was his personal nickname for the clone. Confused at his broken brother calling him by an actual name, CT-782 told 99 to stop calling him by that name. To CT-782, all clones were numbers and never had actual names. 99 disagreed, claiming that CT-782 always had a name.<ref name="Clone Cadets" />

Shaak Ti allowed Domino Squad to retake the test since she and El-Les believed in them. When the squad got ready the next day, CT-782 was not among them. Worried that without their fellow teammate they will fail again, CT-782 showed up. He then told Domino Squad that this time they will pass and that his name was now "Hevy."<ref name="Clone Cadets" />

Bric joined Sakk Ti and El-Les to watch the newly named Hevy and Domino Squad participate in the simulation test for the last time. This time, however, Domino Squad got further into the test. When Hevy, Echo, Fives, Cutup, and Droidbait reached the bottom of the citadel, they noticed that their ascension cable in their belts was missing. Before the test, Bric took the cables from their belts to challenge the cadets. Yet, the clones improvised and decided to climb the blaster turrets that ascended up toward the citadel's roof. Hevy successfully climbed the turrets and lifted the pole on top of the citadel, completing the test. Due to them working as a team and completing their final test, Hevy and the rest of Domino Squad were allowed to become clone troopers.<ref name="Clone Cadets" />

They each received their own medals, as a symbol for their graduation from clone cadet. Hevy then thanked 99 for giving him the help he needed, which brought Domino Squad together. 99 then complemented Hevy on his leadership. But Hevy reminded 99 that they were all a team and told 99 how lucky he was to have a brother like him. As they said goodbye Hevy assured him that they will see each other again while proceeding to give 99 his medal.<ref name="Clone Cadets" />

===Attack on the moon of Rishi===
{{Quote|You may not realize it yet Fives. But you landed on the most boring post in the Outer Rim.''"<br />"''And one of the most important.|Hevy, and O'Niner giving opinions on the Rishi listening base|Rookies}}
[[File:RishiStationCommandCenter-Rookies.png|thumb|left|250px|Hevy was assigned to Rishi Station, a post he found tedious, during the Clone Wars.]]
After his training on [[Kamino]], Hevy was given his first off-world assignment. Along with [[CT-1409|Echo]] and [[CT-4040|Cutup]], he was stationed at a [[Rishi Station|listening post]] located on a [[Rishi moon|moon]] off the planet [[Rishi]], under command of Sergeant [[O'Niner]]. Hevy was soon joined by [[CT-5555|Fives]], [[CT-00-2010|Droidbait]], and trooper [[Nub]]. As part of their assignments, they maintained the [[Rishi Station|listening post]] to warn the [[Galactic Republic]] of any impending [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist]] attacks on Kamino. Hevy was disappointed that his first assignment was not on the actual battlefield. He usually passed the time by arm wrestling with Cutup or Fives. While Hevy and the rookie troopers were on duty in the control room, Sergeant O'Niner entered the room and alerted the clone troopers of an inspection that would soon begin. Unbeknownst to the group of clone troopers, however, Confederate [[General]] [[Grievous]] had sent [[BX-series droid commando]]s in [[Droch-class boarding ship|''Droch''-class boarding ships]] to attack the listening post.<ref name="Rookies" />

[[File:Epguide05.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rishi Station was attacked by Separatist battle droids, forcing Hevy and his comrade to retreat.]]
Grievous, along with the [[assassin]] [[Asajj Ventress]], intended to invade Kamino to end the production of the Republic's clone troopers. The Republic listening post on the moon of Rishi had an "all clear signal," which, if turned off, would alert a nearby Republic fleet, so Grievous ordered his droids to leave the signal untouched. Meanwhile, the clone were alerted by a meteor shower that was approaching. To protect the base, the clones raised the listening post's shield. The meteor shower, in reality, was several Separatist boarding ships used by the commando droids. The droids left their transports and began their attack on the base. In the command center, the clones tried to contact the deck officer clone [[CT-327]] but were unable to reach him. CT-327 had already been killed by the commando droids. O'Niner ordered Droidbait and Nub to search for him. However, the two clones encountered the droids at the base's entrance and were fired upon. Alerted to the droid's presence, O'Niner ordered Hevy, to sound the listening post's alarm, but he soon found that the droids had deactivated the beacon.<ref name="Rookies" />

After the commando droids shot and killed O'Niner, the remaining clone troopers- Hevy, Echo, Fives, and Cutup- evacuated the command center by going through the ventilation shaft, which led them outside the listening post. Exiting the ventilation shaft, the four troops, who already felt helpless without their commanding sergeant, were further disheartened when a [[Rishi eel]] attacked and devoured Cutup, leaving Hevy, Echo, and Fives to defend themselves.<ref name="Rookies" />

====Taking back the Base====
{{Dialogue|Rex|Looks we got ourselves a batch of shinies commander.|Echo|Shinies sir?|Rex|That's right. Your armor, it's shiny and new. Just like you.|Hevy|Sir, me and my batches are trained and ready. We'll take our post, shiny or not.|Rex|There's hope for you yet rookie.|attr=Rex, Echo, and Hevy on taking back the listening post|src=Rookies}}
[[File:Rex inspirational.png|thumb|left|250px|Led by Commander Cody and Captain Rex, Hevy and his troops attempted to retake the station.]]
Eventually, the remaining rookie clone troopers noticed a Republic shuttle, flown by [[Commander]] [[CC-2224|Cody]] and [[Captain]] [[Rex]]. The clone [[officer]]s had arrived for the inspection of the listening post but were unaware of the droid attack. Hevy managed to warn the officers by sending up a [[droid attack flare]]. The clones soon met Cody and Rex after they narrowly escaped a droid ambush. After meeting the clones for the first time, Rex demanded that the rookies remove their helmets to verify that they were clones. After the three rookie clone troopers obeyed and removed their protective headgear, a Rishi moon eel appeared and began to attack them.<ref name="Rookies" />

This time, Rex used his blaster to kill it with one shot to the eye, a feat that impressed the rookies. Confronting the rookie clones, Rex referred to them as "[[shinie]]s," a derogatory term referring to the trooper's spotless armor that had not yet seen a battle. Rex, nonetheless, found the group to be unique and took interest in Hevy's confidence, as well as stating that " there was hope for them yet." Both Rex and Cody gave the rookie troopers each their own blasters before Rex suggested a plan to retake the listening post.<ref name="Rookies" />

The group of clone trooper hid near the entrance of the base while Rex impersonated a [[Unit 26|commando droid unit 26]] by using the droid's decapitated head. The clone captain successfully tricked the commando droids to open the listening post's main door, allowing the clone troopers to ambush the remainder of the commando droids inside the base. Upon entering the command center, the clones defeated the droid units, including their [[vibroblade]]-wielding leader.<ref name="Rookies" />

====Destroying the Base====
{{Quote|This one here is mine!''"<br />"''A big gun doesn't make a big man.|Hevy and Cody, on Hevy picking the Z-6 rotary blaster cannon|Rookies}}
[[File:Rookies2.png|thumb|right|250px|The clones ultimately sought to destroy the station in order to alert Republic forces.]]
Their minor victory was cut short, however when the clone troopers noticed that General Grievous' [[fleet]] had arrived above the moon. Due to the lack of communication from the commando droids, Grievous sent more [[battle droid]]s to the listening post. The clones, inside the command center of the listening post, were unable to turn off the "all clear" signal because the droids had hot-wired it. Soon a [[Landing craft|droid landing craft]] descended through the [[atmosphere]] and landed near the listening post. With the battle droid reinforcements outnumbering the clone troopers, Rex ordered the complete destruction of the base, to the surprise of the rookie troops. They soon realized that if they destroyed the base, the "all clear" signal would stop and the Republic would be alerted to the Separatist attack. Echo offered the use of highly explosive liquid [[tibanna]], stored in plunk droids. While Rex and Echo went to retrieve the specific droids, Cody, Hevy, and Fives grabbed weaponry from the listening post's supply room.<ref name="Rookies" />

When the battle droids reached the entrance of the base, they ordered for the doors to open up, only to find Hevy pointing a Z-6 rotary blaster cannon right at them. Hevy, Cody, and Fives opened fire on the invading battle droid forces, buying time for Rex to wire three plunk droids together. Unexpectedly, the remote activator to detonate the tibanna inside the plunk droids did not function properly. Hevy offered to stay behind and correct the problem, enabling the others to exit the listening post through the ventilation shaft.<ref name="Rookies" />

===Death===
{{Quote|Hevy! Get out of there!"''<br />''"The remote isn't working; I have to detonate it manually.|Rex telling Hevy to evacuate the listening post|Rookies}}
[[File:Z-6 rotary blaster cannon.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Hevy completed the mission alone and, therefore, died as a soldier of the Galactic Republic.]]
Hevy kept trying to link the remote activator to the bombs as the droids got nearer to his position. Realizing that he didn't have enough time, Hevy quickly hid from the approaching battle droids. Assuming that the clones fled, the Separatist droids once again claimed the listening post as their own. Outside, Cody, Rex, Echo and Fives noticed that Hevy was still inside the listening post. Rex tried to contact Hevy via comlink, but Hevy told the clone captain that he had to detonate the explosives manually. The clone trooper then started firing at the [[B1 battle droid]]s after a group of them spotted him. Unwilling to accept Hevy's decision, Rex and the other clones ran back to rescue him.<ref name="Rookies" />

Inside the station, more battle droids approached the command center. Hevy, was then shot in the shoulder by one of the droids. Outnumbered and wounded, Hevy still continued to fight to the command center, ignoring the pleas of the others through his comlink. Hevy's Z-6 rotary blaster eventually ran out of ammunition. He tossed the disabled weapon at the battle droids before being injured in the leg by the droids. Upon Hevy's regaining of consciousness, a battle droid questioned whether or not to take Hevy as a prisoner. Replying that he did not take prisoners, Hevy activated the tibanna explosives, sacrificing himself and destroying the listening post along with the droids inside.<ref name="Rookies" />

===Legacy===
{{Quote|There was an incident on the Rishi moon outpost."''<br />''"He saved our lives, but he gave up his own.|Fives and Echo informing 99 of Hevy's death|ARC Troopers}}
[[File:CloneGraduationMedal-CC.png|thumb|right|250px|Hevy gave his graduation medal to 99, a deformed clone who hoped to return it to him one day.]]
Hevy's sacrifice wasn't in vain. With the listening post destroyed, the "all clear" signal indeed shut off and the [[Galactic Republic|Republic]] was alerted to the presence of the [[General]] [[Grievous]]' [[fleet]] of [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|separatist]] [[frigate]]s. When the Republic arrived, Grievous was forced to retreat as his fleet was outnumbered. Meanwhile, the remaining clone troopers witnessed the destruction of the listening post.<ref name="Rookies" /> Echo commented that Hevy always did hate that base. The clones were then picked up by a [[Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry|LAAT/i gunship]] that just arrived. Onboard the [[Venator-class Star Destroyer|Republic attack cruiser]] ''[[Resolute]]'', Jedi Generals [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Anakin Skywalker]] awarded Echo and Fives each with medals for their service and honored Hevy's bravery and sacrifice.<ref name="Rookies" /> Echo and Fives were then brought into [[Rex]]'s own clone unit, the [[501st Legion]].<ref name="Rookies" />

Unfortunately, the Separatists would launch another attack on the cloning [[Planet|world]] of [[Kamino]] later in the war. The Republic, after intercepting a transmission between Grievous and [[Asajj Ventress]], traveled to Kamino to defend it against the upcoming attack. The 501st Legion was among the many thousands of clone soldiers sent to defend their home, including Echo and Fives. As the two were walking down a hallway in [[Tipoca City]], they ran into [[99]]. 99 welcomed them back, but was saddened to hear that Hevy perished on the [[Rishi]] [[Rishi moon|moon]] [[Rishi Station|outpost]]. He then revealed to Echo and Fives that Hevy gave him his graduation medal before departing Kamino, much to the surprise of the other clones.<ref name="ARC Troopers">{{TCW|ARC Troopers}}</ref>

Grievous and Ventress soon led their attack on Kamino starting with Tipoca City. Echo and Fives destroyed attacking [[Aqua droid]]s from a sniping position, where they were soon joined by 99 bringing them ammunition. They retreated to the [[barracks]] and were joined by [[Rex]] and [[CC-2224|Cody]]. A [[platoon]] of [[battle droid]]s soon attacked the barracks, and by having [[clone cadet]]s strike from ambush, the troopers succeed in destroying all of their attackers, but 99 is killed as he tries to get more ammunition for his brothers. After the battle, both Echo and Fives are promoted to [[Advanced Recon Commando|ARC troopers]] by Captain Rex for their initiative and bravery.<ref name="ARC Troopers" />

==Personality and Traits==
Hevy was a [[human]] created as a clone of the [[bounty]] hunter Jango Fett.<ref name="Rookies" /> Like his genetic template,<ref name="Clone troopers" /> he had [[Color|black]] [[hair]], brown [[eye]]s, and tan skin. His hair was trimmed in a crewcut, while his eyebrows were colored dark red.<ref name="Rookies" /> Like most clone troopers Hevy is loyal to the Grand Army of the Republic first and foremost. However this did not stop him from almost going rogue when he believed he would be submitted to maintenance duty.<ref name="Clone Cadets" />
