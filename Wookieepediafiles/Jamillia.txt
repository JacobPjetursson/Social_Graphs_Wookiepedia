With Amidala's life threatened, both the [[Supreme Chancellor]] of the Republic and the [[Jedi High Council|High Council]] of the [[Jedi Order]] sent her to a [[Varykino|secure retreat]] on Naboo. At the beginning of Amidala's sojourn, Jamillia met her predecessor in the [[Theed Royal Palace|Royal Palace]], and the two discussed the probability of an imminent full-scale conflict between the Republic and the Separatists. Not long afterwards, those concerns came true as the [[Clone Wars]] broke out between the two factions.<ref name="AOC" /> After a four-year reign, Jamillia was succeeded by Queen [[Neeyutnee]].<ref name="Geektionary">''[[Star Wars: Geektionary: The Galaxy From A To Z]]''</ref>
