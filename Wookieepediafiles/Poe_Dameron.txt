'''Poe Dameron''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] who served as a [[pilot]] in the [[New Republic]] and, later, the [[Resistance]] during its [[Cold war|conflict]] and subsequent [[First Order–Resistance war|war]] with the [[First Order]]. The son of [[Lieutenant]] [[Shara Bey]] and [[Sergeant]] [[Kes Dameron]] of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]], Dameron followed in his late mother's footsteps in becoming a pilot, serving the [[New Republic Defense Fleet]] as the [[Rapier Leader|commander]] of [[Rapier Squadron]], but grew disillusioned with the Republic's inaction to the First Order's violations of the [[Galactic Concordance]]. Dameron defected to the Resistance, where he became one of [[General]] [[Leia Organa]]'s most trusted operatives. Dameron flew under the [[callsign]] of [[Black Leader]] while piloting his specialized [[T-70 X-wing starfighter]], ''[[Black One]]''.

As the conflict with the First Order grew more desperate, Dameron was sent to find [[Lor San Tekka]] on [[Jakku]], who had part of a map to locate Organa's brother, [[Jedi Master]] [[Luke Skywalker]]. Though Dameron entrusted the map to his [[astromech droid]] [[BB-8]], he was captured by the First Order and interrogated for the location of the map, eventually being forced to hand over the information. He escaped with the help of a defecting [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtrooper]], whom Dameron nicknamed [[Finn]], and returned to the [[Resistance base]] on [[D'Qar]] on his own. He aided Finn, [[Rey]], [[Han Solo]], and [[Chewbacca]] with air support during the [[Battle of Takodana]], and he later flew during the [[Battle of Starkiller Base|battle]] to destroy the [[superweapon]] known as [[Starkiller Base]]. During the battle, after the base was damaged by Solo, Finn, Rey, and Chewbacca, Dameron fired the shots that destroyed the Starkiller weapon, saving the Resistance from certain destruction.

During the subsequent [[evacuation of D'Qar]], Dameron disobeyed orders and led an attack on the First Order [[Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought|Dreadnought]] ''[[Fulminatrix]]'', but his reckless actions caused him to be demoted from [[Wing Commander]] to [[captain]]. As the First Order [[Attack on the Resistance fleet|pursued]] the Resistance by tracking them through [[hyperspace]] to the [[Crait system]], Dameron did not approve of the passive strategy of [[Vice Admiral]] [[Amilyn Holdo]] and worked with Finn and mechanic [[Rose Tico]] to break into [[Supreme Leader]] [[Snoke]]'s [[flagship]], the ''[[Supremacy]]'', and disable the First Order's [[hyperspace tracker]] before eventually staging a mutiny against Admiral Holdo in an effort to buy Finn and Rose time.

However, Dameron and the mutineers had not realized that Holdo's plan was to discreetly transport the Resistance to an abandoned [[Crait outpost|Rebel base]] on the nearby planet [[Crait]], and his group's actions caused the First Order to discover the Resistance's escape vessels and destroy many of them. Even so, General Organa gave Dameron command after Holdo sacrificed herself, and he led a last-ditch counterattack against the First Order during the [[Battle of Crait]]. The counterattack was unsuccessful, but Dameron was able to lead the surviving Resistance fighters while a [[Force projection]] of Luke Skywalker distracted [[Kylo Ren]] and the First Order, where they found their way to Rey and the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', allowing them to escape.

After the escape, the group took the brief moment of peace to catch up on recent events, and as he left for the [[Battle of Grail City]], the ace was promoted back to [[commander]]. After that, he reflected on what it truly meant to be a member of the Resistance, and how he believed it was about bringing light to dark and saving one's galaxy.

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Quote|People were hurting. People were suffering. Your father and I couldn't sit and do nothing.|Shara Bey, to her son, about her military service|Before the Awakening}}
Three years prior to his [[Reproduction|birth]], Poe Dameron's voice was heard by [[Padawan]] [[Ezra Bridger]] during his mission to a [[World between worlds|place]] that existed between [[time]] and [[Realspace|space]].<ref name="A World Between Worlds">{{Rebels|A World Between Worlds}}</ref> Born two [[Standard year|years]] before the [[Battle of Endor]],<ref name="tfa-TVD" /> Poe Dameron was the son of [[Shara Bey]] and [[Kes Dameron]], who both served the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] in the fight against the [[Galactic Empire]] during the [[Galactic Civil War]].<ref name="SE2">''[[Shattered Empire, Part II]]''</ref> As an infant, Dameron rarely saw his [[parent]]s due to the Alliance's continued operations against the Imperials before and after [[Endor]],<ref name="SE4" /> as his mother worked as a [[Rebel pilot|Rebel]] [[pilot]] for the Alliance's [[Green Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Green Squadron]] and his father was a member of the [[Pathfinders]],<ref name="SE1">''[[Shattered Empire, Part I]]''</ref> and Dameron was thus left in the care of his [[Shara Bey's father|maternal grandfather]].<ref name="SE2" /> Six [[Standard month|months]] after the Battle of Endor,<ref name="BTA" /> after the Imperial remnant put forward [[Operation: Cinder]], Dameron's parents left Rebel service to reunite with him, settle on [[Yavin 4]] and build a [[Yavin 4 colony|house]]—close to which they planted a [[Great Tree (Coruscant)|Force-sensitive tree]], a gift from [[Jedi Knight]] [[Luke Skywalker]].<ref name="SE4" />

At age 6,<ref name="tfa-TVD" /> Dameron began to learn how to fly in his mother's old [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor]], which was part of his mother's compensation package when she mustered out of the Rebellion. She would take Dameron up in it, and he would sit in her lap, learning how to control the ship from her. Tragedy struck [[Dameron family|his family]] when his mother unexpectedly [[Death|died]]; at the time, Dameron was only eight years old.<ref name="BTA" /> [[L'ulo L'ampar]], Bey's fellow Rebel pilot and friend, helped raise Dameron, and was thus like family to him.<ref name="PD4">''[[Poe Dameron 4: Lockdown, Part I]]''</ref>

===New Republic===
Eventually, Dameron became a [[New Republic pilot|pilot]] himself and joined the [[New Republic Defense Fleet]]. Upon entering the New Republic's service, he began to learn the true scope of his mother's heroism, and he himself rose through the ranks, becoming a [[commander]] for the [[New Republic]],<ref name="BTA" /> and earned the reputation of being extremely skilled.<ref name="PD2">''[[Poe Dameron 2: Black Squadron, Part II]]''</ref> Given command of [[Rapier Squadron]], a group of [[T-85 X-wing]]s, Dameron also met the spherical [[astromech droid]] [[BB-8]], who would go onto assist him during his flights as [[Rapier Leader]] and become a steadfast friend from then on.<ref name="BTA" />

His [[squadron]] was stationed at the [[Mirrin Prime Republic Base]], under [[Major]] [[Lonno Deso]]. In time, Dameron came to be aware of the threat the [[First Order]] represented and the leeway they were given by the Republic, but he and his squadron were merely deployed to patrol trade lanes in the [[Mirrin sector]] and protect [[Starship|ships]] from [[Pirate|piracy]].<ref name="BTA" />

====The ''Yissira Zyde''====
{{Quote|It's going to happen again, you realize that, don't you?''"<br />"''If it does, it'll be dealt with then.''"<br />"''So we do nothing? That's the solution? An emerging threat, and we do nothing?|Poe Dameron and Lonno Desso, discussing the First Order|Before the Awakening}}
After four [[Standard week|weeks]] of inactivity, Dameron's scanner picked up a [[Distress signal|distress call]] from the ''[[Yissira Zyde]]''. Once BB-8 pinpointed its exact location above [[Suraz 4]], Dameron and his fellow Rapiers—[[Karé Kun]], [[Iolo Arana]], and [[Muran]]—made the jump into [[lightspeed]], expecting to find the ''Zyde'' under pirate attack. However, they found the [[freighter]] sieged by eight First Order [[TIE line|TIE fighters]], which proceeded to [[Suraz engagement|attack]] them. Breaking them into two elements, Dameron and Kun attacked the TIE fighters, while Arana and Muran broke off the [[shuttle]]s attacking the ''Zyde''. Though during the skirmish Dameron fell five enemy ships, and Kun the other three, the squadron lost Muran.<ref name="BTA" />

[[File:OR-Kappa-2722 skirmish.png|thumb|left|213x213px|Dameron engages the First Order near OR-Kappa-2722.]]
Afterwards, Dameron tried to convince Desso to contact the [[Resistance]] or investigate the attack, but as [[Republic Command]] had ordered not to take action against the First Order, Dameron's request was denied. When they were sent on a patrol once again, Dameron split up from Kun and Arana to do a reconnaissance mission of the ''Yissira Zyde''’s [[hyperspace]] trajectory alone with BB-8. Together, they made it to [[OR-Kappa-2722]] where they found a First Order staging point and Dameron was forced to [[Skirmish in OR-Kappa-2722|engage]] and avoid two dozen TIE fighters while BB-8 located the ''Zyde''’s [[Identification Friend or Foe transponder|ID transponder]] aboard one of the [[Star Destroyer]]s. When they were ready to leave, Dameron made a "[[L'ulo Stand]]" and managed to escape back to [[Mirrin Prime]]. Upon his return to the [[planet]], Dameron met Major [[Caluan Ematt]] and was then made to enter a briefing room alone to meet [[General]] [[Leia Organa]], who requested that he tell her everything about the ''Yissira Zyde''.<ref name="BTA" />

===Resistance===
{{Quote|I'm a Republic officer, General. I swore an oath to protect the Republic, to—''"<br />"''No, you misunderstand. I like it. It was rash of you, as I said, it was foolish. But we could use some rash these days, and foolish and passionate are often confused, and passion is something we desperately need.|Poe Dameron and Leia Organa|Before the Awakening}}
Upon ending his account of the skirmish, Organa realized that Dameron reminded her of her brother Luke Skywalker―for being passionate, an outstanding pilot and dedicated to doing what was right―, and offered him the opportunity to join the Resistance in its [[Cold war|conflict]] against the First Order. Dameron immediately accepted, as did Kun and Arana. Retaining the [[Military rank|rank]] of commander and now in charge of his own fighter [[Fighter wing|wing]], Dameron was transferred to the ''[[Echo of Hope]]'', and in the next few months, he went onto helping in recruiting efforts to find additional pilots, scouting missions, long-range reconnaissance, and searching for signs of First Order movement and positions.<ref name="BTA" />

In his service to the Resistance, Dameron became one of Organa's most-trusted operatives,<ref name="DB:Poe">{{Databank|poe-dameron|Poe Dameron}}</ref> and quickly rose through the ranks of the understaffed [[Resistance Starfighter Corps|Starfighter Corps]], earning the command of both [[Red Squadron (Resistance)|Red]] and [[Blue Squadron (Resistance)|Blue Squadron]]―the latter of which served as the primary line of defense for the [[Resistance base]] on [[D'Qar]]. Under the [[callsign]] of [[Black Leader]], to denote his customized, dark-[[hull]]ed [[T-70 X-wing starfighter]] ''[[Black One]]'',<ref name="tfa-TVD" /> Dameron was assisted during his flights by BB-8.<ref name="DB:BB-8">{{Databank|bb-8|BB-8|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/c16lg}}</ref>

====Operation: Sabre Strike====
{{Quote|Captain Kun is an exceptional pilot, without question, as is Captain Arana, for that matter. But it's a rare pilot who engages one frigate and two Star Destroyers and lives to tell the tale.|Leia Organa to Poe Dameron|Before the Awakening}}
[[File:PoeDameron-BTA.png|thumb|right|190px|Dameron, wearing a Resistance [[flight suit]].]]
Eventually, Dameron was recruited by Organa for [[Operation: Sabre Strike]] to steal [[Navigation computer|navicomputer]] data from the ''[[Hevurion Grace]]'', which belonged to First Order sympathizer and Republic [[senator]], [[Erudo Ro-Kiintor]]. Dameron, in turn, recruited Kun and Arana and acquired three [[Z-95 Headhunter]]s for the operation. Forced to leave BB-8 behind, Dameron and his team went to the [[Uvoss system]] and awaited for the [[Pinnacle-class luxury ship|''Pinnacle''-class luxury ship]] to arrive. When it did, Kun and Arana disabled and escorted the ship as planned, while Dameron used an [[EVA suit]] to board Ro-Kiintor's ''Grace''. Inside, he claimed the ship for the [[Irving Boys]] to cover his true allegiance, and forced the senator, his pilot and his servant to go into the [[escape pod]]s.<ref name="BTA" />

Dameron then made it to the ship's [[cockpit]] and worked on restarting the droid [[engine]]s when First Order's vessels appeared. Depite engaging one [[frigate]] and two Star Destroyers, Dameron, Kun and Aranda managed to escape and land their respective ships aboard the ''Echo of Hope''. General Organa then met with Dameron and sent C-3PO to get everything he could from the flight [[computer]]s. The following morning Dameron confided in Organa that he was angry and worried at their situation, which echoed the [[Imperial Era]]'s characteristic hopelessness that his parents had told him about. Organa then resolved to find [[Lor San Tekka]], whom (according to their findings in the ''Hevurion Grace'') the First Order was trying to locate, and whom Organa believed held a clue to her brother's location.<ref name="BTA" />

====An unlikely friendship====
[[File:A creature attacks Poe & BB-8.JPG|thumb|left|206x206px|A creature attacks Dameron and BB-8.]]
At some point, Dameron and BB-8 visited a [[swamp]] [[Unidentified planet (Neijaian)|planet]]. During the time they ran into the planet's [[Unidentified species (Neijaian)|native]] [[species]] which tried to kill them. Afterwards they also ran into a [[Homeworld|native]] creature. Soon after a young [[human]] [[Sexes|boy]] named [[Kori Ong]] saved them. Dameron responded thanks but they had urgent matter to attend to. Ong responded that he knew the swamps better and suggested to rest for the night because of the roaming dangerous creatures in the swamps. When the next morning came, Dameron, Ong, and BB-8 were caught in a net by natives. BB-8 used his [[welding torch]] to escape. During their escape, Ong stayed behind to hold them off when Dameron and BB-8 escaped but they stayed and help anyway. The three later headed back to Dameron's T-70 X-wing starfighter. Right before Dameron left, he gave Ong a Resistance trinket. Dameron and BB-8 then left the planet.<ref name="AUF">{{IDWAdventuresCite|15|[[An Unlikely Friendship]]}}</ref>

====Retrieving C-3PO====
At some point later, Dameron and BB-8 were deployed to retrieve [[C-3PO]] (with whom he was already familiar), the only survivor of a [[Mission to Taul|mission]] to transmit the location of [[Admiral]] [[Gial Ackbar]] to the Resistance.<ref name="C3PO">''[[Star Wars Special: C-3PO 1: The Phantom Limb]]''</ref>

====Forming Black Squadron====
{{Quote|You are my team, you are my friends. We are Black Squadron&hellip;and it's an honor.|Poe Dameron, forming Black Squadron|Poe Dameron 1: Black Squadron, Part I}}
Determined to find her brother before the First Order did, Organa tasked Dameron with the [[hunt for Lor San Tekka]] at his last-known location. Although trouble was unlikely, Dameron was authorized to select a squadron of four pilots and a [[technician]]. Choosing people whom he could trust, Dameron recruited Kun, L'ampar, [[Temmin Wexley]], [[Jessika Pava]], and [[Oddy Muva]] to form [[Black Squadron (Resistance)|Black Squadron]]. Dameron informed the group that they would be departing on a [[Mission to Ovanis|mission]], but, to L'ampar's disapproval, the purpose of their mission remained classified.<ref name="PD1" />

Except for Muva, Dameron and his squadron departed from D'Qar to [[Ovanis]] where Tekka was last seen. Leaving the rest of his squadron to fly above the surface, he flew ''Black One'' into a perilous cavern and landed at a [[Crèche (culture)|Crèche]] [[Cave of the Crèche|outpost]], and briefly lost contact with the squadron. While BB-8 restore the signal, Dameron inquired about Tekka's location with the outpost's [[Unidentified Crèche elder|elder]], but she refused out of distrust. BB-8 then discovered a [[Homing beacon|tracker]] on his ship, which meant the First Order was likely to arrive soon. Not too long afterwards, Kun reported to Dameron that a [[First Order platform]] was already on site and deploying a taskforce to the cavernous entrance.<ref name="PD1" /> Striking a deal with the elder, Dameron and BB-8 hid their starfighter before [[Agent]] [[Terex]] bursted into the outpost, and Dameron ordered his squadron to "give him some leverage".<ref name="PD2" />

While they did as ordered and fell the platform, Dameron confronted Terex while BB-8 remained hidden. Although he no longer had air support, Terex ordered his [[flametrooper]]s to destroy the [[Crèche egg|sacred egg]] of the Crèche and correctly surmised that the ''[[Ravenous]]'' from [[orbit]] would launch a counterattack.<ref name="PD2" /> However, in the nick of time, the "[[Unidentified Crèche creature|savior]]" hatched from the [[egg]] and attacked everyone. Dameron used the opportunity to distract Terex with a punch, while BB-8 stole the agent's [[blaster pistol]]. As Dameron and Terex fought over it, the creature's counterpart appeared to save the Crèche and killed the newly-hatched beast. Forced into stalemate, Terex called the attack off, and Dameron took advantage of their momentous peace to speak with the elder again. Grateful, she told Dameron where Tekka had gone after leaving the planet, and then left the planet with the rest of her people and the savior. With them safe, Dameron and his squadron retreated from the planet, letting Terex go.<ref name="PD3">''[[Poe Dameron 3: Black Squadron, Part III]]''</ref>

====Prison Break on Megalox Beta====
{{Quote|May the worst win.|Terex|Poe Dameron 4: Lockdown, Part I}}
Back on D'Qar, Dameron reported to Organa about the search's next destination and told her of the tracking beacon BB-8 had found attached to his ship. While she put C-3PO on the case to see what he learned through his network, she also paid a generous amount to get Black Squadron inside the privately-owned [[prison]] of [[Megalox Beta]] so that they could see [[Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi|Grakkus]] the [[Hutt]]—reputed for being a collector of [[Jedi]] artifacts. Upon arrival, Dameron and his squadron were greeted by [[Luta]], who gave them a rundown of the prison's rules, and left her men to escort them to the surface. Although they were left to their own devices, Dameron's team found its way to Grakkus' headquarters. However, Dameron soon found out that Terex was already there and had become aware of Dameron's attempts to find the location of Tekka. Grakkus struck a deal with the two of them: he would provide his information to the one who broke him out of the prison.<ref name="PD4" />

After speaking with Grakkus, Dameron told Black Squadron that Grakkus knew where Tekka was. However, he told them they had break him free out of prison before Terex. "Snap" asked Dameron how Terex got there first. All Dameron knew was that the [[First Order Security Bureau|F.O.S.B.]] have ears everywhere. Thus, Dameron and Black Squadron started to plan the escape. He then waited until a group of prisoners started ram the door.<ref name="PD5">''[[Poe Dameron 5: Lockdown, Part II]]''</ref>

Dameron and the other members of Black Squadron than defended Grakkus's [[Fortress of Grakkus the Hutt|fortress]] against the prisoners under Papa [[Toren]]. Dameron then waited for BB-8 and the other astromechs to disable the prison's gravity field. After BB-8 signaled him, Dameron and the others then turned on their gravity belts. After the prisoners were subdued, Dameron had L'ampar acquire guns. Dameron then went into the fortress and took Grakkus. Dameron then contacted Warden Luta and told him that he knew about his deal with Terex. Dameron was able to convince him to let them return to their fighters and leave with Grakkus on one of Luta's ships. As they left the station, Dameron and the other pilots then engaged with the ''[[Carrion Spike]]''. Before Grakkus made his escape, Dameron was then given information on Tekka. Dameron then returned to D'Qar, where he gave the information to General Organa. Dameron than asked if he would resume his search for Tekka. Organa told him that she had a more important mission for Dameron; to find out who informed Terex about the prison.<ref name="PD6">''[[Poe Dameron 6: Lockdown, Part III]]''</ref>

====Meeting Suralinda Javos====
Dameron the went to [[Pheryon]]. There, he met up with [[Suralinda Javos]], an [[Squamatan]] reporter for the ''[[Galaxy Beacon]]''. Dameron and Javos then came under [[Skirmish on Pheryon|attack]] by a group of thugs. He and Javo then "borrowed" a [[Stormsailer]] to make their escape. Dameron was then told by Javos she was working on a story about the First Order, it's violations of the [[Galactic Concordance]], and increasing its military's power to destroy the New Republic with it's new weapons. Dameron wanted to know more, but Javos wanted to tell General Organa directly.<ref name="PD7">''[[Poe Dameron 7: The Gathering Storm]]''</ref>

Dameron then continued to elude the ships. He and Javos were able to lose in the stormsea. Dameron and Javos then went to a tavern continue their discussion. However, they were then taken by Lieutenant [[Weel]] of the First Order Security Bureau with several hooded [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtroopers]]. Dameron then tried to goad the stormtroopers into fighting him. He was then freed when Javos sprayed acid into Weel's face and took the remaining stormtroopers. Dameron then took Javos to D'Qar. However, Javos had lied about the information and told the truth to both Dameron and Organa.<ref name="PD7" />

====Mission to Kaddak====
{{Quote|Yeah. Just another day on Kaddak. We need to find that droid and get out of here. This isn't just another spaceport. It's a bad place.|Poe Dameron|Poe Dameron 9: The Gathering Storm, Part II}}
Following the mission to Pheryon, Dameron worked on his hand-to-hand combat skill. He also chatted with BB-8 and tried to figure out who was traitor in Black squadron. While Dameron regarded L'ampar, Kun, Pava, and Wexley, Dameron was frustrated that he could no longer trust his squadron mates and blamed Terex. After Muva ran a diagnostic on his X-wing ''Black One''{{'s}} port stabilizers, Dameron allowed Oddy to fly the ''Black One'' as a reward. Shortly later, General Organa dispatched her spymaster C-3PO to enlist Dameron's help in recovering a [[Resistance spy droid network|Resistance spy droid]] on the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] world of [[Kaddak]], who had purportedly uncovered a trove of information on the First Order including the location of [[Supreme Leader]] [[Snoke]].<ref name="PD8">''[[Poe Dameron 8: The Gathering Storm, Part I]]''</ref>

The droid had sent a transmission but had been unable to transmit the data. General Organa had ordered C-3PO and Dameron to travel to Kaddak to investigate and if possible to retrieve the operative. To avoid drawing attention, Organa instructed Poe to take C-3PO and another pilot as backup in a shuttle. Since Poe was unable to trust his fellow Black Squadron pilots, he decided to bring Oddy Muva and BB-8 for the mission. The four traveled to Kaddak on an old freighter.<ref name="PD8" />

Dameron, BB-8, 3PO, and Muva landed in [[the Sliver]], a city on Kaddak built around a giant crystal. Upon arriving, Poe and his party witnessed an unfortunate individual being thrown to their death. Since Kaddak was a bad place, Poe instructed his team to maintain a low profile so they could find the droid and get out fast. Poe's party visited a [[cantina]] in the Sliver's [[Level 45]], which was frequented by various criminal elements including the [[Guavian Death Gang]] and [[Kanjiklub]]. Poe was present when C-3PO and BB-8 interacted with a [[MSE-6 series repair droid|mouse droid]], who revealed that their spy droid was being held by the [[Ranc gang]], a feared criminal syndicated that dominated Kaddak.<ref name="PD9">''[[Poe Dameron 9: The Gathering Storm, Part II]]''</ref>

Together, Poe and the group headed to the Ranc gang's base. Upon arriving, Dameron was [[stun]]ned by a reception staff member. While Poe was unconscious, several Ranc gangsters surrounded his companions. However, C-3PO outmaneuvered them by activating several Resistance spy droids, who forced the gangsters to stand down. As Poe awoke, C-3PO grumbled about exposing a good set of operatives. Poe also assured BB-8 he was allright. Oddy also informed Poe that C-3PO had dispatched the Resistance spy droids to search for their asset, who turned out to be the [[BX-series droid commando]] [[N1-ZX]] ("Nunzix"). Instead of expressing gratitude, Nunzix chided them for taking too long.<ref name="PD10">''[[Poe Dameron 10: The Gathering Storm, Part III]]''</ref>

Despite their small victory, Poe and his team ran into a new problem when N1-ZX refused to divulge the information until he had safely been returned to the Resistance base on account of his self-preservation programming. Dameron toyed about giving Nunzix a "Robo-lobotomy" but C-3PO countered that forcibly infiltrating his system would result in a complete [[memory wipe]]. Dameron reluctantly agreed to return to D'Qar. Before they could do so, Lord Terex flew over the Sliver in his starship ''Carrion Spike'' and placed a bounty on Poe's head. Terex had already retaken control of the Ranc gang. Dameron and his team were attacked by a mob but Poe managed to activate more spy droids to hold the crowd at bay.<ref name="PD10" />

Poe and the droids managed to return to their freighter but were separated from Oddy Muva. Since their freighter was not very spaceworthy, Poe had BB-8 open the freighter's cargo bay, which contained his X-wing ''Black One''. Poe and the droids departed on the ''Black One'' with C-3PO and N1-ZX riding in storage compartments on the fighter's cargo hull. Poe decided to leave the freighter for Oddy as a get-away vehicle. Unknown to Poe, Terex had allowed him and the droids to escape. Terex's ''Carrion Spike''{{'s}} sensors were capable of tracking the ''Black One''. Terex also mustered a fleet of [[Ugly|"Uglies"]]
to hunt down Poe.<ref name="PD10" /> Oddy also stowed aboard the ''Carrion Spike'', intent on rescuing his wife [[Sowa Chuan]].<ref name="PD11">''[[Poe Dameron 11: The Gathering Storm, Part IV]]''</ref>

====Showdown with Agent Terex====
Once in space, Poe got BB-8 to set a course for D'Qar. While traveling through hyperspace, Poe confided in BB-8 and C-3PO his angst about how Terex had been able to keep one step ahead of him. After ruling out the droids, General Organa, and his Black Squadron mates as traitors, Poe realized that their mole was Oddy Muva.<ref name="PD11" /> In fact, Oddy Muva had been blackmailed by Terex into spying on Black Squadron in order to guarantee the well-being of his wife Sowa Chuan.<ref name="PD12">''[[Poe Dameron 12: The Gathering Storm, Part V]]''</ref> Poe also realized that the information Nunzix was carrying was part of a ploy by Terex to undermine the Resistance.<ref name="PD11" />

After exiting hyperspace, Dameron contacted N1-ZX and voiced his suspicion that Terex had planted disinformation. Shortly later, Poe's X-wing was followed by Terex's flagship ''Carrion Spike'' and a fleet of "Uglies". Terex quickly realized that Poe had figured out his plan and ordered the Ranc fighters to destroy his perennial foe. Poe managed to shoot down two enemy "Uglies" before crashlanding on a [[Unidentified desert planet (Cold war)|desert planet]].<ref name="PD11" />

Poe and the droids survived the crashlanding but N1-ZX's right arm was severed. While BB-8 guided N1-ZX into a cave, Poe carried C-3PO on his back. The group narrowly escaped being incinerated by several "Uglies." Poe decided to bring the group deeper into the cave. Shortly later, Terex led a landing party into the cave in pursuit of Poe and the droids. BB-8 managed to slow down the Ranc gang by collapsing an ice stalactite on top of them but was shot down. During the journey, tensions surfaced between Poe and Nunzix, who was only concerned with safeguarding his own well-being. Despite some misgivings, Poe allowed C-3PO to stay behind in an effort to slow down Terex and his gang.<ref name="PD12" />

After Terex got passed C-3PO and stole the droid's memory unit, Poe tried to convince N1-ZX to fight but the droid was unwilling to put himself at risk due to his self-preservation software. In frustration, Poe pointed his blaster at N1-ZX but the droid retorted that doing so would give their position away. When all seemed lost, Poe was contacted by his second-in-command Temmin, who reassured him that Black Squadron had come to his aid. Black Squadron then engaged in a dogfight with the ''Carrion Spike'' and Terex's fleet of "Uglies."<ref name="PD12" />

With N1-ZX unwilling to fight, Poe contacted Terex, who sent him a droid personality template for his late [[B1 battle droid]] [[Mister Bones]]. Poe used his [[comlink]] to transmit the template onto N1-ZX, who assumed Mister Bones' identity. Mister Bones quickly killed Terex's henchmen before being shot and beheaded by Terex. When Terex dared Poe to come out of hiding, Poe leapt onto Terex from higher ground and threw him to the ground. Poe then confronted Terex with his blaster and vowed to settle scores with him.<ref name="PD13">''[[Poe Dameron 13: The Gathering Storm, Part VI]]''</ref>

However, Terex hurled a dagger at Poe. The dagger pierced Poe's right hand, causing him to drop the gun. Terex then prepared to kill Poe with his [[vibroblade]] but was electrocuted by BB-8. Meanwhile, Oddy Muva managed to evacuate his wife and Terex's other slaves in escape pods. Black Squadron provided cover as the escape pods headed to the desert world. During the skirmish, L'ampar was killed when his A-wing was shot down. Still, the Resistance pilots managed to escort Oddy and the escape pods to safety. Terex's fleet was wiped out when First Order forces under Commander [[Malarus]] arrived above the desert planet to chastise Terex for insubordination.<ref name="PD13" /> Terex had disobeyed the Supreme Leader's directive to avoid direct conflict with the New Republic and its aligned forces.<ref name="PD11" />

Poe dragged Terex and C-3PO out of the cave. He was greeted by Commander Malarus and several stormtroopers and TIE fighters. To ward off a First Order attack, Dameron instructed Temmin and the other pilots to do a fly over and record everything that happened. Commander Malarus however was not interested in fighting the Resistance and praised Dameron for his political savvy. She then informed him that she had come to arrest Terex. Poe did not object since Terex was his enemy. Before handing Terex over, Dameron taunted Terex about the destruction of his fleet. When Terex countered that Poe had lost one of his pilots, Dameron responded that he had only lost a friend while Terex had lost everything.<ref name="PD13" />

====Meeting Kazuda====
Some time later, Poe and BB-8 chanced upon several pilots training in the New Republic navy, who were being pursued by the TIE pilot Major [[Elrik Vonreg|Vonreg]] of the First Order. One of the pilots, [[Kazuda Xiono]], the son of a wealthy senator, directly confronted Vonreg as the other two escaped. Poe managed to thwart Vonreg's attack and, impressed by his bravery and skill, hired Kazuda as a spy and loaned BB-8 out to him. Kazuda and BB-8 were sent to the [[Colossus]] station on the ocean world of [[Castilon]], where Poe showed them around and introduced them to [[Jarek Yeager]], a former rebel pilot and war veteran, who he appointed as Kazuda's mentor. After a brief conversation with Yeager, Poe returned to the Resistance.<ref name="The Recruit">{{Resistance|The Recruit}}</ref>

====Rescue of Synara San====
Poe later returned to the Colossus and decided to have a flight in space alongside Kazuda. However, their flight was interrupted when they [[Investigation of a G-class freighter|found]] a crashed [[Darius G-class freighter]] in an asteroid field with strange life signs emanating from it. Upon arrival, they found that the place had been taken over by [[Kragan Gorr]]'s [[Kragan Gorr's pirate gang|pirate gang]], but a huge creature devoured most of them. Still trying to find the source of the life signs, they ran through the ship, but they were hindered by the ship's released cargo, [[Kowakian monkey-lizard]]s. Eventually, they found the source of the life signs: an unconscious [[Mirialan]] pirate named [[Synara San]]. They rescued Synara and evaded the huge creature, who turned out to be a [[Kowakian ape-lizard]]. Synara and Kazuda were later dropped off on the Colossus as Poe flew away.<ref name="Signal from Sector Six">{{Resistance|Signal from Sector Six}}</ref>

====Station Theta Black====
During his spying operations, Kazuda had sent data stolen from the First Order to the Resistance. This data was found to lead to a set of coordinates in the [[Unknown Regions]]. Poe later visited the Colossus, rescuing Kazuda who had been flying on the faulty ''[[Fireball (starship)|Fireball]]''. Poe and Kazuda visited General Organa, who revealed her findings to them and instructed both to find the location, though she warned Poe not to directly confront the First Order. Eventually, they found the location: [[Station Theta Black]], an abandoned mining facility built into an asteroid. Inside the station, they found that most of the equipment was defunct as the area was very soon set for demolition, but managed to learn that the station was used to mine huge quantities of [[dedlanite]]. Shortly after, the First Order stormtroopers, lead by Captain [[Phasma]], arrived at the station and confronted Kazuda and Poe, who managed to narrowly escape. In space, they evaded Vonreg and his fleet, and narrowly avoided the destruction of the station. Telling Leia of their findings, Leia stated that she doubted that this would dissuade any of the New Republic senators sympathetic to the First Order, but hoped more people would start supporting the Resistance due to this.<ref name="Station Theta Black">{{Resistance|Station Theta Black (episode)|Station Theta Black}}</ref>

====Mission to Jakku====
{{Quote|The Resistance... will not be intimidated by you.|Poe Dameron to Kylo Ren|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}
A few months after his adventures with Kazuda, Poe picked up BB-8, and at Organa's behest, both went to [[Tuanul]] on [[Jakku]] to retrieve a map to Skywalker's location from Lor San Tekka, but during the meeting, stormtroopers under the command of [[Kylo Ren]] [[Attack on Tuanul|attacked]] the village. Alerted by BB-8 of their arrival, Dameron and the droid attempted to flee in their [[X-wing starfighter]], but a pair of stormtroopers disabled the engines. Left with no alternative, Dameron gave the map to BB-8 and ordered the astromech to flee, while he remained behind to cover BB-8's escape. After watching the confrontation between Tekka and Ren, Dameron tried to take a shot at Ren, but he [[Force Stasis|caught]] the [[blaster]] bolt in mid-air and immobilized Dameron simultaneously with [[the Force]]. Dameron was subsequently taken prisoner, while the rest of the villagers were slaughtered.<ref name="Episode VII" />

[[File:Finn and Poe Escape Finalizer.png|thumb|right|253x253px|Dameron and Finn escaping the ''Finalizer''.]]
Taken aboard the [[Resurgent-class Star Destroyer|''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Finalizer]]'', Dameron resisted interrogation until Ren assaulted him with the Force, which eventually caused Dameron to crack about BB-8. Left alone by Ren, a renegade stormtrooper named [[Finn|FN-2187]] helped Dameron escape. Together, they stole a [[TIE/sf space superiority fighter]] from a [[hangar]] bay, with FN-2187 manning the guns while Dameron piloted the fighter, and managed to disable the ''Finalizer''’s [[turbolaser]]s. Upon a disagreement—while FN-2187 wanted to flee the [[Star system|system]], Dameron attempted to return to Jakku to retrieve BB-8 and the map—, their TIE fighter was disabled on General [[Armitage Hux]]'s orders, the blast knocking Dameron out.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Whereas FN-2187, dubbed "Finn" by Dameron, ejected from the TIE shortly before it crashed on the planet's surface,<ref name="Episode VII" /> Dameron was unable to eject due to his jacket getting caught in the ejector mechanism. With no time left to eject, Dameron piloted the craft as skillfully as he could to a crash landing which threw him clear of the the crash, his jacket falling in another direction.<ref name="PD26">''[[Poe Dameron 26: The Awakening, Part I]]''</ref> Suffering from a concussion and a brief period of memory loss, he moved away from the crash. When he awoke, Dameron found himself alone and set off to find a ship and contact the Resistance, sure that he would be able to reunite with BB-8 with their help. During his journey, he encountered a Jakku native, the [[Blarina]] [[Naka Iit]], whom Dameron managed to impress with both his sheer audacity and his piloting skills, such that he agreed to get Dameron to a ship in [[Blowback Town]] that would get him back to the Resistance.<ref name="TFA-novel">[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'' novelization]]</ref> Dameron hitched a ride from Iit's friend, [[Ohn Gos]] to Yavin 4, where he left ''Black One'' prior to his mission to Jakku.<ref name="Flight Log">''[[Poe Dameron: Flight Log]]''</ref>

====Battle of Takodana====
{{Quote|Go straight at 'em. Don't let these thugs scare you.|Poe Dameron|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}
[[File:Poe Dameron X-wing XWM.png|thumb|left|240x240px|Poe engaging First Order forces on Takodana.]]
Following the [[Hosnian Cataclysm|destruction]] of the [[Hosnian system]], Dameron was deployed to lead a squadron of Resistance X-Wing fighters to fend off the First Order garrison [[Battle of Takodana|attacking]] [[Maz Kanata]]'s [[Maz Kanata's castle|castle]] on [[Takodana]].<ref name="Episode VII" /> Dameron, piloting the ''Black One'', swooped in dangerously low, attacking at treetop level, and took out parked TIE fighters, clusters of [[trooper]]s, and support vehicles, firing repeatedly without wasting a single energy burst.<ref name="TFA-novel" /> The battle ended prematurely when Ren ordered his troops to retreat once he had captured [[Rey]], a [[scavenger]] who had seen the map to Skywalker's location.<ref name="Episode VII" />

After returning to base, Dameron was reunited with BB-8 and Finn, who offered to return his jacket. Dameron declined, stating that his jacket suited Finn better. Subsequently, the ex-trooper requested Dameron's help in rescuing his friend Rey, by asking Dameron to take him to meet General Organa. Together, they made it to the conference room, where Finn disclosed what he knew of the First Order [[superweapon]], [[Starkiller Base]]. After a reconnaissance flight by Wexley, the Resistance command made the plans to attack the base, assigning Dameron to lead the starfighter attack to the weapon's [[thermal oscillator]].<ref name="Episode VII" />

====Batte of Starkiller Base====
{{Quote|All right, let's light it up!|Poe Dameron during the attack run on Starkiller Base|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}
Upon receiving notice that the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' had landed on Starkiller Base, Organa sent the order to deploy the X-wings. Dameron, in the lead, was aboard ''Black One'' and assisted by BB-8 once again, and departed D'Qar along his fellow pilots.<ref name="TFA-novel" /> Once Finn, [[Han Solo]] and [[Chewbacca]] were able to bring down the thermal oscillator's [[Deflector shield|shields]], Dameron was given full authorization to [[Battle of Starkiller Base|attack]], and his team emerged from lightspeed.<ref name="Episode VII" /> Ordering his fellow pilots to hit the target as many times as possible with as many runs as they could get, he himself let loose his X-wing's full complement of armament,<ref name="TFA-novel" /> but they barely damaged the building before a host of TIE fighters moved to engage the X-wing squadrons, as well as deployed [[Seeker (missile)|seekers]].<ref name="Episode VII" />

[[File:Poe blowing up Starkiller Base.png|thumb|right|250px|Dameron flies in and destroys the Starkiller's thermal oscillator.]]
The ground team, however, planted [[pyro denton explosive]]s to create an opening in the containment center, which Dameron took advantage of—with the assistance of his squadron, he flew through the opening and caused heavy damage inside, starting a chain reaction that would ultimately destroy Starkiller Base. Dameron escaped the explosion, heading for the outer atmosphere,<ref name="Episode VII" /> yet at the order of General Organa to retreat immediately, Dameron refused to leave their friends in the ''Falcon'' behind. His fellow pilots concurred, and Dameron gave the order to find them.<ref name="TFA-novel" />

After spotting the ''Falcon'' leaving Starkiller Base, Dameron called in his teams in relief and reached D'Qar shortly before the old [[YT-1300 light freighter]] did.<ref name="TFA-novel" /> Like BB-8 and many others, he waited for the ''Falcon'' as it landed on their base. There, sometime later, Dameron was present for a strategic gathering concerning the map to Skywalker's location, when Skywalker's astromech, [[R2-D2]], awoke and revealed his possession of an incomplete [[The galaxy|galactic]] map from the Imperial archives, only completed with BB-8's fragment.<ref name="Episode VII" />

====Evacuation from D'Qar====
After the succesful attack on Starkiller Base, the Resistance lowered their guard on their base at D'Qar, having initially come to believe that they weren't going to live another day. However, as they resumed their activities, C-3PO called General Organa and the other Resistance members to inform them that the [[First Order Navy]] was regrouping to attack them in retaliation, resulting in Organa ordering Threepio to give the order of [[Evacuation of D'Qar|evacuating]] the planet. Concluding that they would not be able to leave the planet before the attack, Dameron proposed a pretty simple distraction idea, which Organa agreed to listen: he would pilot the ''Black One'' and hold the First Order's fleet long enough to give them time for evacuating, considering that the First Order commanders had planet-sized egos would lead them to compete to take him out.<ref name="PD28">''[[Poe Dameron 28: The Awakening, Part III]]''</ref>

Though Admiral [[U.O. Statura]] informed Dameron that he wasn't going to survive such a maneuver, Dameron replied that he would be a tiny target for the [[Star Destroyer]]s' large weaponry that would never hit him, assuring that he could even fly close to the Destroyers so to make them cause damage between each other. Convinced that Dameron's tactic would serve, Organa approved his plan and wished [[May the Force be with you|the Force would be with him]]. Before departing, Pava told him that his idea was terrible, as the ''Black One'' had an experimental booster. At that moment, Snap, [[Tallie Lintra]], Suralinda Javos appeared on scene and Wexley told Dameron that in case he was blown up, they would help to finish the mission, including Pava, telling him that this was a mission for the whole Black Squadron despite Dameron saying that their assistance wasn't part of the plan. However, General Organa came and dismissed their assistance, telling Captain Wexley that she needed them to reach out their New Republic allies and gather help before Snoke consolidated his power across the galaxy.<ref name="PD28" />

====Demotion and mutiny against Amilyn Holdo====
{{Quote|COWARD! These transport ships are unarmed, unshielded. We abandon this ship, we're done, we don't stand a chance. No, you are not just a coward, you are a traitor.|Dameron yelling at Holdo onboard the Raddus|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}
Shortly after giving Armitage Hux a message about his [[Armitage Hux's mother|mother]], Dameron eliminated the surface cannons onboard the ''[[Fulminatrix]]'', paving the way for [[Cobalt Squadron (Resistance)|Cobalt Squadron to]] bomb the dreadnought. However, his overconfidence to destroy it overcame him, resulting in the destruction of the squadron, turret gunner [[Paige Tico]], and many others. Eventually, Dameron's reckless actions landed him in trouble with his allies, and he was demoted from<ref name="Episode VIII" /> [[Wing Commander]]<ref name="SW 177">''[[Star Wars Insider 177]]''</ref> to the rank of [[Captain]] by General Organa following the evacuation of D'Qar, as well as a slap to the face from her. However, Organa was heavily injured during the subsequent [[attack on the Resistance fleet]] in which many veteran Rebels like Ackbar were killed, allowing [[Vice Admiral]] [[Amilyn Holdo]] to take Organa's role as leader. To his shock, Holdo's plans involved the loss of [[gas]] for the ''[[Raddus (MC85 Star Cruiser)|Raddus]]'', which would have allowed the First Order to eventually blow up the [[flagship]] and kill the remaining Rebels.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

[[File:Poe meets Holdo.jpeg|thumb|left|249x249px|The feud between captain and vice admiral begins]]
Sure that Leia wouldn't have approved Holdo's direction, Poe teamed up with [[Lieutenant]] [[Kaydel Ko Connix]], maintenance worker [[Rose Tico]], BB-8, and Finn to organize a plan to save the Rebels. While Finn, Tico and BB-8 went to [[Canto Bight]]'s [[Canto Casino|casino]] in a [[Mission to Canto Bight|mission]] to find a codebreaker, Poe and Connix remained aboard the ''Raddus''. After Finn, Rose and BB-8 returned with [[DJ]], the codebreaker they hired to infiltrate aboard the ''[[Supremacy]]'', Poe and his allies started the mutiny against Holdo and her allies, with Poe trying to convince C-3PO to join his cause, although 3PO refused to be part of the mutiny for being unethical. However, Organa recovered by the time of the mutiny and after Holdo managed to escape from Poe's mutineers, the princess arrived on the bridge and fired a stun blast, knocking him out.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

====Battle of Crait====
{{Quote|We are the spark that'll light the fire that'll burn the First Order down.|Poe Dameron|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}
Eventually, Organa decided to follow Holdo's plans to abandon ship. Said and done, every member of the Resistance evacuated, leaving Holdo aboard the ''Raddus'' to be blown up due to her decision to sacrifice herself in order to give time for the others to escape. However, aboard the ''Supremacy'', Finn and Rose were subdued by the First Order stormtroopers, with Bee-Bee slipping out from captivity after being sold out by DJ for a large sum of money and his freedom, allowing Hux to order the destruction of the Resistance fleet. However, Holdo entered hyperspace on the ''Raddus'', crashing it against the ''Supremacy'', sacrificing herself in the process and causing the deaths of multiple First Order stormtroopers and officers. This action allowed Poe and the other Rebels escape to the [[mineral]] planet of [[Crait]].<ref name="Episode VIII" />

Once at Crait, the Rebels entered in the planet's [[Crait outpost|outpost]]. During the ensuing [[Battle of Crait|battle]], Poe commanded the Rebels and ultimately managed to weaken the First Order's army. However, they concluded that they would not be able to escape, but when Poe saw a [[vulptex]] running away through an unknown passageway, the Rebels followed him under Leia's orders to escape. However, the passageway ended in a hole too small for the Rebels to pass. Fortunately, while Luke Skywalker was fighting against Kylo Ren, Rey appeared and moved the rocks with the Force, allowing the Rebels to escape to fight another [[Standard day|day]]. Once safe, Poe met Rey, and took the opportunity to introduce himself to the last Jedi.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

===Aboard the ''Falcon''===
Now safe from the First Order, drinking accompanied by Rey, Finn and BB-8, Poe commented about their past experiences, leading Rey to tell him that she had learned they can't dwell on changing the past, rather concentrate in the present. Poe responded, however, that he just avoided a lot of heartache and that considering all they went through, it was hard to not think about different paths, prompting Finn to comment that had they would have met the scavenger together, perhaps he wouldn't have been knocked to the ground by her.

As the former stormtrooper said that he believed Poe to have died in the TIE crash, Poe proceeded to state that he walked away from tons of crashes, telling Rey that there were extenuating circumstances to crash as she asked him why he crashed constantly if he was the "best" pilot of the galaxy. After Finn commented that perhaps Rey was the best pilot than him and Poe responded that at least they got away alive, Finn asked him how he survived, as he never explained him in detail how he got off-world from Jakku, leading Poe to recall and tell the story of his miracle survival.<ref name="PD26" />

Poe continued to tell his adventures, even telling his friends how he felt over Takodana, leading Rey to comment that it sounded like he had the Force, but Poe refused and confirmed he was not Force-sensitive. Leia entered into the room and told him that the Force was with him, as it was with all of them. She then departed from the room to rest and asked Dameron to meet her afterwards to talk with him. Finn then left too to see if Rose was better, leaving Poe and Rey alone, both agreeing that Finn was a good person, as he saved their lives. Poe took the opportunity to ask her about her adventure with Luke Skywalker, but one of the porgs that Chewbacca adopted interrupted them, causing Rey to tell him about the small avian creatures.<ref name="PD27">''[[Poe Dameron 27: The Awakening, Part II]]''</ref>

After commenting his wish of getting another X-Wing following the destruction of the ''Black One'', Poe told Rey that he regretted the Resistance having deployed too soon from Takodana because they could have saved Kanata's castle from getting destroyed, causing her ask him about Kanata's status, to which Poe informed her that Kanata was alright. Rey then commented him about being tortured by Kylo Ren on his ship, to which Poe told her that Kylo did the same on him, calling themselves "torture buddies". He then proceed to tell her about his initial thoughts about Starkiller Base and his mission to drop Wexley inside a [[Unidentified Resistance recon pod|recon pod]] in order to let him scan the base, setting stage for the destruction of the base.<ref name="PD27" />

As Poe left to speak with Finn, Rey had Threepio translate one [[book]] of the [[Sacred Jedi texts|sacred texts]] of the Jedi. Poe met with him, asking him about Rose's status, to which Finn replied that she was asleep and though he believed that it was good, he wasn't sure at all given that he wasn't a [[doctor]] and commented to him that in the First Order, if stormtroopers had the fault of receiving a mortal wound, they were left to die, causing Poe to comment that such idea was insane. He then told his friend that he was sure that Tico would be alright even though he couldn't be sure that she was as he can't be sure if the First Order would lose the war or if the things they needed to happen would ever happen, but that he was sure that he could choose to believe that Tico would recover. After wrapping Rose, Finn asked Poe why they didn't defeated the First Order after Starkiller was destroyed, causing the Resistance to lose almost everything, including its base.<ref name="PD28" />

As such, Poe told his friend what exactly happened after Starkiller's destruction, having Finn being unconscious at the [[flexpoly bacta suit]] after his short duel against Ren. After he told him about the evacuation from D'Qar, Finn asked him what happened to the rest of Black Squadron, to which Poe said that from the [[distress call]] they sent from Crait, they received no response, assuming that Wexley and the others didn't had luck in gathering their Republic allies, to which Finn asked him if he would choose to believe that they succeeded, as he previously stated his thoughts about Rose's recovery. Just at that moment, Threepio appeared on scene and told the two men that from one of their [[Relay station/Canon|relay stations]], they had received a transmission from the Black Squadron, leading Poe to tell Finn that they just needed to have a little faith. Upon his excitement, however, Poe was interrupted by Threepio, who proceeded to inform him that unfortunately, the news were actually far from being good.<ref name="PD28" />

Listening to BB-8's [[hologram]] transmission, Dameron heard how Pava reported that her starfighter was defective, asking Bee-Bee to pause the recording and asking Threepio to not tell him if the recording showed Pava's last words, to which C-3PO responded that the recording ended there and that perhaps the First Order detected the comsat and destroyed it. As Threepio revealed that the incomplete recording took place during the evacuation from D'Qar and that General Organa requested him to see it as one of the few remaining military commanders, Dameron responded that by such incomplete footage, he couldn't be sure whether his teammates were alive or dead.<ref name="PD29">''[[Poe Dameron 29: The Awakening, Part IV]]''</ref>

Repeating Pava's recording, just as he ordered BB-8 to playback the recording once more, Dameron was informed by the protocol droid, wondering if the First Order had built a second Starkiller Base and blown up ten more planets, that they had now good news, as Black Squadron had send a new message through a secondary encrypted and a bit garbled relay node. Dameron happily thanks Threepio's information and listened to the transmission after playing Pava's recording for a final time. Listening to the message, Pava informed him that Black Squadron had been involved in an [[Battle of Grail City|attack]] on [[Ikkrukk]], in which they had been fighting First Order forces at the cost of Suralinda Javos' X-wing, though she survived. She promised Dameron to send another report as soon she can. Just as the recording finished, C-3PO appeared on scene once more and informed Dameron that he had received Pava's promised message, giving it to BB-8 to play it. Unfortunately, the recording showed a bleeding Pava, hiding on a cave, revealing that their attack on the First Order to defend Ikkrukk had gone all wrong, ending the transmission to Dameron's horror.<ref name="PD30">''[[Poe Dameron 30: The Awakening, Part V]]''</ref>

===Ikkrukk===
Realizing that his friends were in danger, Poe went to see General Organa and begged her to let him to go to Ikkrukk to save his friends, but the General refused, reminding him that the [[First Order military]] was immense. She told him that her future decisions had to be careful, because if she made another mistake, it could be all over for the Resistance, and therefore the ''Falcon'' could not go. Poe tried to convince her that it was necessary to rescue Black Squadron. After hearing some good words about his teammates, Poe heard the General doubting the worth of going to Ikkrukk and risking the safety of other members such as Rey or Chewbacca. She told Dameorn she wanted the squadron to be safe, but knew they couldn't save them and so had to wonder if it was necessary. Poe assured her that in a way Black Squadron ''was'' the Resistance and needed to be saved. Knowing that Organa wanted him to lead, he told her that she needed him more than a pilot but that as they said to each other, no one was left behind. Hearing his superior's complaints about herself, Dameron responded that they needed to show the galaxy that if they joined the Resistance, no one would be left behind. Organa understood that Poe was right, so she promoted him back to Wing Commander and wished the Force to accompany him, though she didn't allowed him to take the ''Falcon''.<ref name="PD31">''[[Poe Dameron 31: The Awakening, Part VI]]''</ref>

Taking a [[Unidentified starfighter|new starfighter]] which once belonged to Grakkus the Hutt, Poe flew to Ikkrukk, destroying one of the [[turret]]s of the [[Maxima-A class heavy cruiser]] the ''[[Fortitude]]'' that Snap and his wife were trying to destroy. He then reported to [[Colonel]] [[Barrut]], the [[First Order officer]] at the command of the ''Fortitude'' to inform her who he was after she insulted him. Upon hearing that the First Order reported that he died during the evacuation of D'Qar, he proceeded to tell Barrut that he didn't died at D'Qar and revealed to her the fate of Snoke, the ''Supremacy'', twenty Star Destroyers and the ''Fulminatrix'', but she refused to believe him and ordered him to be killed. Instructing his teammates to follow his orders to perform an special maneuver, Poe was able to blew up several TIEs, which in turn damaged the ''Fortitude'' enough time to allow [[Prime Minister]] [[Grist]] to activate Grail City's defensive systems as the shield went down to destroy the cruiser, killing Barrut and her crew.<ref name="PD31" />

Now reunited, Poe and his friends had a warm reunion. Though they attributed their victory to him, Poe responded that their victory came from all of them, and that they still work together as long as necessary. Before he could inform his teammates of the Resistance's status, they were interrupted by Grist, who thanked Dameron for helping them save not only Grail City, but also Ikkrukk. After promising Snap to join the Resistance as one of their allies, Grist invited the team for a drink, but Dameron and Wexley stood behind to talk a little. As they went to accompany Grist and the rest of the team, Poe promised Sanp to tell him the story of what the Resistance did during their absence. That night, Poe reflected on what message he learned, and as he said that it was pivotal to save their galaxy. Knowing that anyone could do anything to make the galaxy better, Poe determined that the Resistance had begun.<ref name="PD31" />

Dameron regarded his fellow pilots Karé Kun, Jess Pava, L'ulo L'ampar, and Temmin Wexley, and the technician Oddy Muva as close friends that he could trust. Poe was also adventurous and willing to risk danger such as when he entered the Cave of the Crèche. Dameron treated his hosts with respect.<ref name="PD1" /> Dameron's selfless and concern for the well-being of others led him to surrender himself to the First Order Agent Terex in an attempt to save the Crèche egg. As a commander, Dameron was a fair-minded and just leader who gave his Black Squadron mates ample room to improvise.<ref name="PD2" /> Poe regarded his astromech droid BB-8 as a close friend who would aid him in combat and someone he could confide with.<ref name="PD3" /><ref name="PD8" /> Poe was also magnanimous in victory and allowed Terex and his men to leave following the mission to Ovanis. This was also tempered by Dameron's unwillingness to provoke war between the First Order and the Resistance.<ref name="PD3" />

Dameron and his Black Squadron mates' devotion to the Resistance cause led them to risk life and limb on several occasions including the [[Mission to Megalox Beta]]. Poe and his comrades managed to fight their way to Grakkus' [[fortress]] despite being double-crossed by the prison guards.<ref name="PD4" /> When faced with competition from Terex, Poe showed resilience and ingenuity as a commander. He got BB-8 and the other astromech droids to lower [[Megalox]] prison's gravity shield; eliminating opposition from Terex and convincing Grakkus to accept their rescue offer.<ref name="PD6" />

After learning there was a spy within the Resistance ranks, Dameron found himself unable to trust his Black Squadron mates despite regarding them as friends.<ref name="PD8" /> Poe was also willing to walk into danger in an effort to recover information for the Resistance.<ref name="PD9" /> During a [[Mission to Kaddak]], Poe was only saved from capture by the efforts of C-3PO. While Poe was able to work well with droids like BB-8 and C-3PO, he found the commando droid "Nunzix" self-serving and irritating due to the droid's strong self-preservation mechanism. Poe was annoyed that the droid refused to disclose the information in his memory banks.<ref name="PD10" /> Poe had little patience with Nunzix and expressed annoyance at the droid commando's unwillingness to fight; overlooking the fact that the droid had lost one of his arms. Poe's irritation with Nunzix was reinforced by his suspicion that the information Nunzix was carrying was a trap set by Terex.<ref name="PD11" />

Due to their repeated encounters on several missions, Dameron came to regard Terex as a nemesis and blamed him for sowing distrust among his Black Squadron pilots.<ref name="PD8" /> Poe was determined to root out the spy and eventually realized that the spy was Oddy Muva; who had been blackmailed by Terex into spying on the Resistance.<ref name="PD11" /> Despite his hatred for Terex, Dameron did not seek to destroy the First Order agent and instead handed him back to his First Order superiors. While Dameron grieved the loss of one of his pilots L'ampar, he took comfort in the fact that Terex's Ranc gang fleet had been destroyed.<ref name="PD13" />

By the end of the cold war, Dameron was a courageous hero of the Resistance dedicated to defeating the First Order.<ref name="TLJ Junior Novel">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: A Junior Novel]]''</ref> Though brash, Dameron had great charisma and limitless respect for the founders of the Resistance, particularly Leia Organa,<ref name="Episode VIII" /> a reason for which Organa tried to teach him that being a hero and being a leader wasn't the same thing.<ref name="TLJ Junior Novel" /> Organa was sure that Poe would be a great leader one day, but he still had a lot to learn, even though Dameron didn't agree.<ref name="TLJ Read-Along Storybook & CD">''[[The Last Jedi Read-Along Storybook and CD]]''</ref> Dameron's fellow pilots joked that if the Resistance had recruitment posters, Dameron would triple their numbers with his dashing bravado alone. Unlike many starfighter pilots, Dameron delighted in [[Atmosphere|atmospheric]] missions, soaring through skies and skimming the surfaces of planets.<ref name="tfa-TVD" />

==Skills and abilities==
{{Quote|That's one helluva pilot!|Finn, on Poe Dameron|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}
[[File:Natural Talent SWDestiny.png|thumb|right|228x228px|Dameron was a skilled pilot]]
Confident in his piloting skills,<ref name="TFA-novel" /> Dameron flew starships since he was six years old, and by the age of 32, he had became the most daring and skilled of the Resistance pilots.<ref name="tfa-TVD" /> He was a decorated X-wing pilot who could fly anything,<ref name="DB:Poe" /> managing to familiarize himself with a TIE/sf fighter's controls in a matter of minutes and under pressure,<ref name="Episode VII" /> as well as with a ''Pinnacle''-class luxury ship.<ref name="BTA" /> During the Battle on Takodana, he showed to be skilled enough to fire repeatedly without wasting a single energy burst and destroy multiple First Order assets.<ref name="TFA-novel" /> In addition to his piloting skills, Dameron was a capable [[infantry]]man.<ref name="tfa-TVD" />

L'ampar once observed that Dameron trusted his subordinates to figure things out on their own rather than give them bad orders, and saw it as the mark of a good commander.<ref name="PD2" /> Dameron was also skilled in hand to hand combat which he used against the First Order and criminal proxies on several occasions.<ref name="PD3" /><ref name="PD5" /> On a few occasions, Poe was saved from the jaws of defeat by his indefatigable and loyal droid companion BB-8.<ref name="PD3" /><ref name="PD13" /> was Poe was also known to practise with unarmed combat during his free time.<ref name="PD8" /> Poe could also fly a rundown freighter, which he once used on an undercover mission.<ref name="PD9" />

A speaker of [[Galactic Basic]], Dameron also understood [[Binary]],<ref name="Episode VII" /> and thus had no need for reading BB-8's translated speech in a console to understand what the astromech said while plugged into his starfighter.<ref name="BTA" />

==Behind the scenes==
Poe Dameron was portrayed by actor [[Oscar Isaac]] in [[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']], the ''[[LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' video game and [[Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VIII ''The Last Jedi'']]. For the ''[[LEGO Star Wars: The Resistance Rises]]'' episode "[[Poe to the Rescue]]," the character is voiced by [[Lex Lang]].<ref name="Lex Lang">{{cite web|url=http://lexlang.com/The_Official_Lex_Lang_Website/Animation.html|title=Animation|website=lexlang.com|date=|accessdate=September 22, 2016}}</ref> Isaac's casting in the film was first announced on [[April 29]], [[2014]],<ref name="Cast Announce">{{SW|url=news/star-wars-episode-vii-cast-announced|text=Star Wars: Episode VII Cast Announced}}</ref> and the character was revealed in the first teaser trailer for the film on [[November 28]], 2014.<ref name="Teaser Trailer">{{SW|url=films/star-wars-episode-vii-the-force-awakens|text=''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens''}}</ref> His name was revealed by [http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/12/11/star-wars-the-force-awakens-character-names/ ''Entertainment Weekly''] in an exclusive trading card.<ref name="Name Revealed">{{Cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/12/11/star-wars-the-force-awakens-character-names/|title='Star Wars: The Force Awakens' character names revealed (in coolest way possible) -- exclusive|first=Anthony|last=Breznican|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=December 11, 2014|accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref> Dameron was named after [[J.J.

The character was originally meant to die in ''The Force Awakens'', but Abrams changed his mind after realizing Isaac was hesitant about accepting the role (as he had previously played several characters that were killed soon after being introduced).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/film/longform/a18451/oscar-isaac-interview/|title=Oscar Isaac: High Flyer|[[Wikipedia:Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|publisher=esquire.com|last=Collinge|first=Miranda|date=|accessdate=November 16, 2017}}</ref> Isaac recounted that after he initially met Abrams, "[He] soon wrote back: 'Never mind. I've figured it out. You're in the whole movie now.' I was like, 'Holy shit! Alright, cool.' Let’s say that it was in that conversation that we began to see a way that being in the movie would be worth his time and the audience’s."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gq.com/story/star-wars-the-force-awakens-character-death|title=''Star Wars'' Actor Reveals Which Character Was Supposed to Die in ''The Force Awakens''|work=CQ|date=2015-12-19|first=Brett|last=Martin|accessdate=2015-12-21}}</ref> On [[March 20]], [[2015]], Isaac revealed that he would appear in ''Star Wars'': Episode VIII ''The Last Jedi'', as well.<ref name="Isaac Episode VIII">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/20/oscar-isaac-will-be-back-for-star-wars-episode-viii-lobbied-for-x-men-apocalypse-role|title=Oscar Isaac Will be Back for Star Wars: Episode VIII, Lobbied for X-Men: Apocalypse Role|first=Max|last=Nicholson|work=IGN|date=March 20, 2015|accessdate=March 20, 2015}}</ref> ''The Force Awakens's'' [[Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)|novelization]] includes an additional sequence detailing Dameron's escape from the planet Jakku.<ref name="TFA-novel" /> The sequence was later revisited in the [[Poe Dameron 26: The Awakening, Part I|twenty-sixth issue]] of the [[Star Wars: Poe Dameron|''Poe Dameron'' comic series]], with much of the dialogue and exchange between Poe and other characters being revised and changed almost entirely.<ref name="PD26" />

When asked on ''Ellen'' about there being "any romance between these characters" in ''The Force Awakens'', Isaac replied "I think it's a very subtle romance that's happening, you know you have look very closely, you have to watch it a few times to see the little hints, but there was, at least ''I'' was playing romance," to which [[John Boyega]] interjected "I was." Isaac declined to say with which character he interpreted Poe as having romance with, though "it could be a droid".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuAwgmz7jTc|title=The Cast of 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' Is Here!|work=Ellen|publisher=YouTube|date=2015-12-17|accessdate=2016-01-08}}</ref> These comments, coupled with the way Isaac had Poe bite his lip while complimenting Finn, prompted speculation that Poe could be an LGBT character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2016/01/06/a_gay_star_wars_hero_could_save_lives_in_this_galaxy_why_the_lip_bite_that_launched_a_thousand_ships_matters/|title=A gay “Star Wars” hero could save lives in this galaxy: Why the lip bite that launched a thousand ‘ships matters|first=Eli|last=Keel|work=Salon|date=2016-01-06|accessdate=2016-01-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hypable.com/star-wars-poe-dameron-queer-protagonist/|title=Is Star Wars setting up Poe Dameron as its first queer protagonist?|work=Hypable|first=Natalie|last=Fisher|date=2015-12-24|accessdate=2016-01-08}}</ref>

''The Last Jedi'' director [[Rian Johnson]] said that he forgoed having Poe go with Finn to Canto Bight as it would have been boring ("I knew something was wrong when I looked at their dialogue and realized I could interchange any of the lines", he said.)<ref>''[[The Art of Star Wars: The Last Jedi]]''</ref> Poe's eventual arc in the film was influenced by war movies like ''[[Wikipedia:Twelve O'Clock High|Twelve O'Clock High]]'' and ''[[Wikipedia:The Dawn Patrol (1938 film)|The Dawn Patrol]]'', which explored the contrast between bravado and true heroism, "which is leadership". He said that Poe's conflict with Amilyn Holdo, a woman, "and not only that, but it's a woman who isn't in a general's outfit but has a real feminine energy, seemed like the toughest thing that Poe could come up against."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-star-wars-last-jedi-rian-johnson-20171217-story,amp.html|title=How Rian Johnson made heroism inclusive in 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi'|work=Los Angeles Times|first=Jen|last=Yamato|date=2017-12-17|accessdate=2017-12-18}}</ref>
