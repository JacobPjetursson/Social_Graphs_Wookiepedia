{{Quote|Wing commanders, form up. We're going in.|Saesee Tiin, during the [[Battle of Lola Sayu]]|Citadel Rescue}}
'''Saesee Tiin''', a [[Force-sensitive]] [[Iktotchi]] [[Sexes|male]] from the [[moon]] [[Iktotch]], was a [[Jedi Master]] who served on the [[Jedi High Council]] during the [[Fall of the Republic|last]] [[Standard year|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic]]. A skilled [[lightsaber combat]]ant and [[starfighter]] [[pilot]], Tiin fought in the [[Clone Wars]] as a [[Jedi General]] of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]]. He was [[Death|slain]] by [[Darth Sidious]] when the [[Jedi]] [[Duel in Palpatine's office|confronted]] the [[Sith Lord]], who was revealed to be the true identity of [[Supreme Chancellor]] Sheev Palpatine.

==Biography==
===Blockade of Naboo===
A [[Sexes|male]] [[Iktotchi]] born on the [[moon]] [[Iktotch]], Saesee Tiin was eventually promoted to the rank of [[Jedi Master]] and appointed to a seat on the [[Jedi High Council]] prior to the [[Invasion of Naboo|blockade]] of [[Naboo]] by the [[Trade Federation]]. Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn]], who had been sent by [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Finis Valorum]] to end the blockade alongside his [[Padawan]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], came before the council after rescuing [[Queen]] [[Padmé Amidala]] and bringing her to [[Coruscant]]. [[Sexes|He]] told the council that he believed he had [[Duel on Tatooine|encountered]] a [[Sith Lord]] on [[Tatooine]] and that a [[Slavery|slave]] he freed, [[Anakin Skywalker]], was the [[Chosen One]]. The council was skeptical of Jinn's claims and denied him permission to train Anakin due to him being too old. After Jinn was [[Battle of Naboo|slain]] on Naboo by [[Maul|Darth Maul]], Tiin and the council attended his [[Funeral of Qui-Gon Jinn|funeral]] and decided to let Kenobi train Skywalker fulfilling Jinn's dying wish.<ref name="TPM" />

===Battle of Geonosis===
[[File:Saesee Tiin Geonosis.png|thumb|left|250px|Seassee Tiin stands among fellow surviving Jedi during the battle of Geonosis]]
Tiin was a [[Jedi assault team|participant]] in the [[Battle of Geonosis]], the first battle in the [[Clone Wars]], against [[Count]] [[Dooku]] and the newly-formed [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] and their armies of battle droids. Tiin, unlike many others in the battle, survived, having escaped alongside [[Mace Windu]] and [[Ki-Adi-Mundi]],<ref name="Episode II" /> and became a [[Jedi General]] in the [[Grand Army of the Republic]].<ref name="datatiin" />

===Clone Wars===
====A mysterious killer====
During the [[Clone Wars]], Tiin was present at the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]] when [[Delta Squad]] brought back the bodies of Jedi Master [[Halsey]], and his apprentice [[Knox]] who were killed in the [[Devaron massacre|massacre]] on [[Devaron]]. [[Adi Gallia]] suspected it was the work of the presumed dead [[Asajj Ventress]], however [[Plo Koon]] suspected it was a newly appointed Sith Lord. Obi-Wan Kenobi, on the other hand, suspected it was the work of a monstrous animal. The mysterious killer was revealed to be the [[Nightbrothers|Nightbrother]] [[Savage Opress]], which surprised Kenobi as Opress appeared similar to Darth Maul who he had supposedly beaten on Naboo years before.<ref name="WotM">{{TCW|Witches of the Mist}}</ref>

====Battle of Lola Sayu====
[[File:Saesee Tiin's Starfighter-CR.png|thumb|right|250px|Tiin flying his [[starfighter]] during the Battle of [[Lola Sayu]]]]
Tiin took part in the [[Battle of Lola Sayu|rescue]] of [[Even Piell]], [[Wilhuff Tarkin]] and his men from the [[Citadel]] [[prison]] on [[Lola Sayu]] in which they were imprisoned, due to the fact that they were carrying [[Nexus Route|vital information]] of [[Hyperspace route|hyperspace]] coordinates that could change the scale of the war to the faction in possession of the said secret information. Piell was killed by an [[Anooba]] that pounced on him. Tiin alongside Adi Gallia, Plo Koon and [[Kit Fisto]], rescued what remained of the team and returned with them to Coruscant.<ref name="Citadel Rescue">{{TCW|Citadel Rescue}}</ref>

====Water War====
Kit Fisto, Anakin Skywalker, and all other [[Galactic Republic|Republic]] [[Grand Army of the Republic|troops]] were trapped in a losing [[Battle of Mon Cala|battle]] against their opposition's superior strength provided by the [[Quarren]] and [[Aqua droid]]s. Kit Fisto and the others managed to contact the Jedi Temple with a faint signal, yet it was too weak and within moments collapsed. Windu understood the broken communication as sign of the Republic's impending defeat, however noting that it would take a considerable time to train any new [[Clone SCUBA trooper|SCUBA troopers]], the situation was dire. On this topic, [[Yoda]] recommended that they should ask help from a suitable ally of the Republic. Master Tiin suggested they contact the [[Gungan]]s who were an amphibious [[species]] with a standing [[Gungan Grand Army|army]] and [[planet]] located near [[Mon Cala]].<ref name="Gungan Attack">{{TCW|Gungan Attack}}</ref>

====Battle of Umbara====
Anakin Skywalker, [[Pong Krell]], Obi-Wan Kenobi and Saesee Tiin were all present during the [[Battle of Umbara]] with [[Pong Krell]] and Saesee Tiin's troops supporting Kenobi's troops in the south of the planet.<ref name="Darkness on Umbara">{{TCW|Darkness on Umbara}}</ref>

====The council's plot====
Tiin was present during the [[funeral of Obi-Wan Kenobi]], which was in fact a plot created by the Council to infiltrate the ranks of [[bounty hunter]]s and discover a plan created by Count Dooku to capture the Chancellor, which succeeded as Skywalker and Windu were able to prevent the Chancellor's assassination on Naboo.<ref name="Deception">{{TCW|Deception}}</ref>

====Temple bombing====
Tiin was present at the [[funeral of the Jedi Temple bombing victims|funeral]] for the victims of the [[Bombing of the Jedi Temple hangar|bombing of the Jedi Temple]], where in fact the [[Barriss Offee|culprit]] of the bombing was hiding among the present Jedi, [[Admiral]]s and [[Politics|political]] figures.<ref name="Sabotage">{{TCW|Sabotage (episode)|Sabotage}}</ref>

Tiin also partook in deciding the expulsion of Jedi fugitive [[Ahsoka Tano]] after the bombing, where he, along with Masters Windu and [[Ki-Adi-Mundi]], did not believe Tano was innocent of the crime. Tiin noted that Tano had been found with [[nano-droid]] explosives, the same devices used in the bombing, which he felt alone was enough for her to be convicted. In the end, however, Tano's name was cleared after Barriss Offee, the actual bomber was uncovered by Anakin Skywalker. Tano was offered a [[Jedi Knight|place]] back in the Order, but refused.<ref name="The Wrong Jedi">{{TCW|The Wrong Jedi}}</ref>

====A voice from beyond the grave====
Later during the war, Tiin was present when Master Yoda felt he was hearing a voice from beyond the grave, but the combined power of all of the Council members could not find anything. Yoda left Coruscant after this without the Council's express permission. On the planet [[Dagobah]] Yoda had a vision that Tiin engaged in a [[lightsaber duel]] with [[Darth Sidious]] and was killed when Sidious stabbed him.<ref name="Voices">{{TCW|Voices}}</ref>

====Death====
[[File:The Death of Saesee Tiin.png|thumb|left|250px|Saesee Tiin's death at the hands of Darth Sidious]]
Tiin was one of four masters sent to arrest Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, revealed by Anakin Skywalker to be the powerful Sith Lord [[Darth]] Sidious, along with Fisto, [[Agen Kolar]] and Windu. Sidious, however, [[Duel in Palpatine's office|resisted]] his arrest, instead pulling out [[Darth Sidious's lightsabers|his]] [[Color|red]] [[lightsaber]] and engaging the group of Jedi in [[Lightsaber combat|combat]]. Despite the skills of the Jedi Masters, the Sith Lord quickly [[Death|cut down]] Kolar and Tiin before engaging Windu and Fisto in a brief duel, killing Fisto and leaving only Windu to continue the fight, who was later slain by the Sith Lord.<ref name="Revenge of the Sith" />

==Powers and abilities==
Master Tiin had natural telepathic powers that were superior to most other Jedi, and was an ace [[starfighter]] [[pilot]].<ref name="AEYNTK">''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know]]''</ref> He was also a skilled swordsman, something he proved numerous times during the Clone Wars. He was present at the opening foray on Geonosis, and was among the small circle of survivors that escaped from the Petranaki arena.<ref name="Episode II" /> By the end of the Clone Wars, Tiin's reputation was such that he was selected to aid in the arrest of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, alongside fellow Jedi Masters Kit Fisto, Agen Kolar, and Mace Windu.<ref name="Revenge of the Sith" />

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:SaeseeTiinConceptArt.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Early concept art for Saesee Tiin.]]
Saesee Tiin was portrayed and voiced by several actors during the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[prequel trilogy]]: [[Khan Bonfils]] in [[1999]]'s [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']], [[Jesse Jensen]] (brother of [[Kit Fisto]]'s actor [[Zachariah Jensen]]) in [[2002]]'s [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']] and [[Kenji Oates]] in [[2005]]'s [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]. He was voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]] in the ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' TV show.

On playing Tiin in ''Attack of the Clones'', Jesse Jensen's brother Zachariah, who was working as set carpenter, was originally suggested by [[Matt Sloan]] to play Tiin, but after director [[George Lucas]] and producer [[Rick McCallum]] met Zachariah, they gave him the role of Kit Fisto and Jesse was given the part of Tiin.<ref name="Early Casting">{{SW|url=news/from-concept-to-screen-kit-fisto|text=Kit Fisto: From Concept to Screen}}</ref>

In the first draft of ''Revenge of the Sith'', Tiin would have been killed alongside Ki-Adi-Mundi on [[Mygeeto]] during [[Order 66]].<ref name="MoRotS">''[[The Making of Star Wars Revenge of the Sith]]''</ref>
