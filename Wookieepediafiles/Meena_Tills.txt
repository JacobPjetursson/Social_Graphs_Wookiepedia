==Biography==
===The Clone Wars===
During the [[Clone Wars]], Tills represented [[Mon Cala]] in the [[Galactic Senate]].<ref name="USW">''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''</ref>

====Civil War on Mon Calamari====
When [[Mon Cala]] was engulfed into war with the [[Mon Calamari]] being supported by the Republic, but with the [[Quarren]] backed by the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatists]], the king of [[Mon Cala]] was murdered, leading it to be uncertain who would succeed him. When [[Lee-Char]], the Prince of Mon Cala, stepped forward, he was met with a revolution as the [[Quarren]] and the Separatists launched a full siege. Tills traveled back from the Senate with [[Padmé Amidala]], [[Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Ahsoka Tano]] to inspect the situation. When Amidala informed the Senate that the situation had become a full scale civil war, the Republic sent aide and thousands of troops.<ref name="Water War">{{TCW|Water War}}</ref> The war worsened and Tills, along with Char's few remaining loyal followers, were captured and imprisoned. However when the Separatist army was defeated and [[Lee-Char]] was seen as the true ruler, Tills attended his [[Coronation of Lee-Char|coronation]] and looked heavily pleased at [[Mon Cala]]'s return to diplomacy.<ref name="Prisoners">{{TCW|Prisoners}}</ref>

===End of the War===
When the War came to an end, Tills joined the [[Delegation of 2,000]] where she attended one of the final meetings with [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]] before the [[Galactic Empire]] was formed.<ref name="Databank" />
