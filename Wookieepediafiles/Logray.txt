'''Logray''' was a [[Sexes|male]] [[Ewok]] from the forest moon of [[Endor]] who served as the [[chief]] [[shaman]] of [[Bright Tree tribe]] during the [[Galactic Civil War]].<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" /> At one point during the war, [[Luke Skywalker]], [[Han Solo]], [[Chewbacca]] and [[C-3PO]] were brought to the tribe. Logray, believing Threepio a [[Deity|god]] ordered Skywalker, Solo, and Chewbacca to be cooked as a sacrifice to their "god". The three were freed after Skywalker used [[the Force]] to trick the Ewoks into believing that Threepio was using his "[[magick|magic]]" in a display of powerful anger.<ref name="Episode VI" /> When the Ewoks were debating on helping the Rebels in assaulting the [[Death Star's shield generator|shield generator]], Logray was hesitant to get involved, concerned for the safety of the Ewoks and feeling that this conflict was bigger than them. Eventually he was swayed over by the others and was greatly moved by [[Teebo]]'s messages sent out to the neighboring tribes. Eventually, he and the other Ewoks attacked the Imperial forces stationed on the moon during the [[battle of Endor]]. He participated in the celebration the followed the destruction of the second [[Death Star II|Death Star]].
