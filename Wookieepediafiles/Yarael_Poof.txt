'''Yarael Poof''' was a [[Sexes|male]] [[Quermian]] [[Jedi Master]] who served on the [[Jedi High Council]] during the final [[Standard year|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic]]. Both an expert practitioner of [[Jedi]] [[mind trick]]s and illusions and a skilled [[diplomat]] and [[teacher]], Poof witnessed the reemergence of the Jedi's ancient enemy, the [[Sith]], and the discovery of the [[Chosen One]], [[Anakin Skywalker]], who was prophesied to bring balance to [[the Force]]. He [[Death|perished]] on a mission sometime prior to the [[Battle of Geonosis]] and was replaced on the Council by the [[Vurk]] Jedi Master [[Coleman Trebor]].

==Biography==
[[File:High Council Chamber.png|thumb|left|250px|Poof observes the evaluation of Anakin Skywalker]]
[[Homeworld|Originally]] from<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" /> the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]]<ref name="Galactic Atlas">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]''</ref> [[Planet|world]] of [[Quermia]], Yarael Poof was a revered [[Jedi Master]] who served on the [[Jedi High Council]] during the final [[Standard year|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic]].<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" /> A celebrated [[diplomat]] and [[teacher]], [[Sexes|he]] was the most senior of the four [[Quermian]]s enrolled in the [[Jedi Order]] during the [[Invasion of Naboo]].<ref name="Card Trader">[[Star Wars: Card Trader|''Star Wars'': Card Trader]]</ref>

Shortly before the [[Battle of Naboo]], Poof was present in the [[Jedi Council Chamber]] of the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]] on [[Coruscant]] when Jedi Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] came before the Council with news that the [[Sith]], the ancient enemies of the Jedi Order, had resurfaced. He later observed Jedi Master [[Mace Windu]] evaluate the [[The Force|Force]] abilities of [[Anakin Skywalker]], a nine-year-old boy from the planet [[Tatooine]] whom Jinn had discovered to be [[Force-sensitive]] and believed to be the [[Chosen One]], a being who was prophesied to bring balance to the Force. Although the child was strong in the Force, the Council denied Skywalker entrance into the Order as they found his deep emotional attachments troubling and believed that he was too old for training. The Council reversed their decision, however, after Jinn was [[Death|slain]] by the [[Sith Lord]] [[Maul|Darth Maul]] on [[Naboo]], allowing Skywalker to become the [[Padawan]] of Jinn's former apprentice [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], per Jinn's dying wish.<ref name="The Phantom Menace" />

Poof [[Death|perished]] on a mission<ref name="Visual Encyclopedia">''[[Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia]]''</ref> sometime prior to the [[Battle of Geonosis]] and was replaced on the Council by the [[Vurk]] Jedi Master [[Coleman Trebor]].<ref name="Updated and Expanded" />

Although appearing as a serene thinker among the Jedi Council members, Poof also had a mischievous side and enjoyed playing [[mind trick]]s on colleagues.<ref name="Updated and Expanded" />

==Powers and abilities==
Skilled in teaching and diplomacy,<ref name="Card Trader" /> Poof was an expert practitioner of illusions and Jedi mind tricks,<ref name="Absolutely Everything You Need to Know" /> which he could use to bring conflicts to a decisive end.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:YaraelPoofConcept.jpg|thumb|right|Early concept art of Yarael Poof, which was labeled simply "Alien Jedi"]]
Yarael Poof first appeared in the [[1999]] film [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']], in which he was portrayed by a puppet operated by [[Michelle Taylor]]. Although his name was never spoken in ''The Phantom Menace'', it was given in the film's credits.<ref name="The Phantom Menace" /> Poof was originally slated to reappear in [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']], but [[George Lucas]] was concerned that viewers would confuse him with the [[Kaminoan]]s, a new species introduced in the film. As no new footage of the Jedi Council chambers were shot for Episode II, archive footage from Episode I was reused. In order to remove him from the film, Poof was digitally painted out of the footage and replaced by Coleman Trebor, a new Jedi Master designed for the movie.<ref name="Homing Beacon #67">{{SWArchive|url=site/homingbeacon/67.html|text=Homing Beacon #67}}</ref>

According to both ''[[Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia]]'', Poof died prior to the outbreak of the [[Clone Wars]].<ref name="Updated and Expanded" /><ref name="Visual Encyclopedia" /> Despite this, he later appeared as part of the Jedi Council in ''[[Jedi of the Republic&mdash;Mace Windu, Part V]]'', a story that takes place during the aforementioned conflict.<ref name="Mace Windu">''[[Jedi of the Republic&mdash;Mace Windu, Part V]]''</ref> According to [[Matt Martin]] of the [[Lucasfilm Story Group]], this was an error and the Council's composition should have been consistent with that previously seen in ''[[Jedi of the Republic&mdash;Mace Windu, Part I]]''.<ref name="Twitter">{{Twitter|missingwords|status/946182236973309959|[[Matt Martin]]|quote=The comic. The council seen in issue 5 should be the same as that in issue 1. Looks like I missed it.|image=File:PoofDead.png|noimage=}}</ref>
