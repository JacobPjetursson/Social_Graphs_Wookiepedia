'''Quarrie''' was a [[Mon Calamari]] [[Sexes|male]] who built a [[Prototype B6|prototype]] [[A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter|B-wing starfighter]] on the remote [[planet]] [[Shantipole]] some time after the [[Siege of Lothal]].

==Biography==
[[File:Quarrie WotM.png|left|thumb|250px|Quarrie]]
Quarrie was a [[Mon Calamari]] [[starship]] engineer who lived on the remote planet of [[Shantipole]] during the [[Imperial Era|Age of the Empire]].
After the early rebellion suffered losses [[Early rebellion against the Galactic Empire|against]] the [[Galactic Empire]] during an attempted blockade run, rebel [[Hera Syndulla]] and [[Spectres|members of her crew]] came to Shantipole in order to retrieve the prototype B-Wing, [[Prototype B6]], which he dubbed the "Blade Wing". Quarrie was initially uninterested, as he did not believe Syndulla to be the right [[pilot]] for his ship. However, her story of growing up and dreaming of being a pilot swayed Quarrie's mind, and he allowed her to test the [[starfighter]].<ref name="WotM" />

After a successful test run, the starfighter was taken back to the network's fleet. For the journey, he also installed a hyperdrive and an exterior astromech socket on Hera's [[shuttle]] ''[[Phantom]]''. The ''Phantom'' then towed the B-wing prototype to the planet [[Ibaar]]. With the B-Wing's advanced weaponry, the rebels were able to break the [[Blockade of Ibaar|Imperial blockade]] over the planet Ibaar and deliver food to the planet's starving populace. Afterwards, Quarrie, along with his [[Lothal astromech droid]] [[BG-81]], left the network fleet in order to oversee the production of more B-Wings for the rebel cause.<ref name="WotM" />

==Personality and traits==
Quarrie was a short, [[Sexes|male]] [[Mon Calamari]] master engineer who specialized in building starships. He took pride in his work and was eager to experiment with speed, agility, and weapons. Quarrie was not a [[pilot]], and was only willing to let the best pilot fly his [[Prototype B6]] starfighter. His prototype B6 became the basis for the rebellion's [[A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter]].<ref name="Databank">{{Databank|quarrie|Quarrie}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
Quarrie's name is derived from the name of concept artist [[Ralph McQuarrie]].<ref name="Name">{{SW|url=news/swca-star-wars-rebels-past-present-and-future-panel-liveblog|text=''Star Wars Rebels'' Past, Present, and Future Liveblog}}</ref> He first appeared in the ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' [[Star Wars Rebels Season Two|Season Two]] episode "[[Wings of the Master]]", which premiered on [[Disney XD]] on [[November 11]], [[2015]].
