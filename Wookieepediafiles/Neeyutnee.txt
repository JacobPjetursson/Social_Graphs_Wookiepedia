'''Neeyutnee''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|female]] who served as the [[Monarch of Naboo|Queen]] of [[Naboo]] during the [[Fall of the Republic|fall]] of the [[Galactic Republic]].

==Biography==
===Blue Shadow Virus===
Neeyutnee was born on Naboo prior to the Clone Wars.<ref name="Blue Shadow Virus" /> During the [[Clone Wars]], Neeyutnee was elected as the [[Monarch of Naboo|Queen]] of [[Naboo]], succeeding [[Queen]] [[Jamillia]]. [[Sexes|She]] relied on insight and experience offered by [[Senator]] [[Padmé Amidala]]<ref name="Databank" /> In 21 BBY,<ref name="Galactic Atlas">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]''</ref> several [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist]] [[droid]]s infiltrated Naboo. After this discovery, Naboo was placed on high alert as it could lead to another invasion. Because of this, Amidala and [[Junior Representative]] [[Jar Jar Binks]] came to Naboo to aid in the investigation. When they arrived, Neeyutnee and [[Captain]] [[Gregar Typho|Typho]] greeted them. Neeyutnee stated that besides the droids that have already been spotted, there weren't any more and pleaded that Amidala convince the [[Galactic Senate]] or the [[Jedi High Council]] that Naboo was threatened.<ref name="Blue Shadow Virus" />

Later, they came to inspect the [[Tactical droid]] [[TR-350]] with Amidala asking Neeyutnee if they received any information. Binks spotted an [[insect]] coming out of another [[battle droid]] and tried to get it as it was only found in the [[Eastern swamps]]. Neeyutnee listened as Amidala's [[protocol droid]], [[C-3PO]], interrogated the tactical droid before Binks

inadvertently destroyed it during his chase of the insect. They were able to deduce that the droids came out of the Eastern [[swamp]]s due to the location. They informed the Jedi
Council what they discovered and Amidala convinced them to send [[Jedi General]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], [[Jedi]] [[General]] [[Anakin Skywalker]], and [[Ahsoka Tano]]. Eventually, it was discovered that the [[scientist]] [[Doctor|Dr.]] [[Nuvo Vindi]] was trying to revive the [[Blue Shadow Virus]].<ref name="Blue Shadow Virus" /> Vindi was defeated by the [[Galactic Republic|Republic]] and the virus was stopped.<ref name="Mystery of a Thousand Moons">{{TCW|Mystery of a Thousand Moons}}</ref>

===Skirmish on Naboo===
In [[20 BBY]], Naboo was again a target for the Separatists with rumors circulating that the [[Gungan]]s were aiding General [[Grievous]] invade the [[planet]]. Amidala was sent to investigate along with Skywalker and after a brief

[[Skirmish on Naboo|skirmish]] was captured. Neeyutnee witnessed the Separatists come in with Skywalker and ordered they hand back Grievous in exchange. They did. [[Boss]] [[Lyonie]] and Neeyutnee thanked Binks for preventing war against the [[Naboo (people)|Naboo]] and the Gungans a second [[time]].<ref name="Shadow Warrior">{{TCW|Shadow Warrior}}</ref>

===Skirmish on Theed===
Later, Neeyutnee greeted [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] to Naboo for the [[Festival of Light]] which celebrated
[[File:ThankYouJedi-Crisis.png|thumb|left|251x251px|Neeyutnee after the Festival of Light]]
the anniversary of when Naboo joined the Republic. That night, [[bounty hunter]]s led by [[Count]] [[Dooku]] and [[Cad Bane]] attempted to capture Palpatine but was thwarted by Kenobi who was disguised as the [[bounty]] hunter [[Rako Hardeen]]. The next morning, Neeyutnee was part of a protection group consisting of Amidala and [[Governor]] [[Sio Bibble]].<ref name="Crisis on Naboo">{{TCW|Crisis on Naboo}}</ref> She was succeeded by Queen [[Apailana]] by [[19 BBY]].<ref name="Episode III">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref>
