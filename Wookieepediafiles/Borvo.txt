'''Borvo the Hutt''' was a powerful [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]] with a [[Sexes/Legends|male]] personality who operated a large and profitable [[Nal Raka Criminal Empire|business]], [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggling]] everything from [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]] to [[Spice/Legends|spices]]. As an influential figure, he had dozens of strongholds on [[Planet/Legends|worlds]] located throughout the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Like many ambitious young Hutts, Borvo left his [[Hutt Space/Legends|home space]] early in his criminal career. He found a perfect hideout in the mountains of [[Naboo/Legends|Naboo]], a lush [[Planet/Legends|world]] with small police and security forces and far from the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic's]] watchful eyes. He and his people established a base on [[Porso Hill]], and also took over a [[N-1 starfighter/Legends|N-1 starfighter]] [[N-1 assembly site|base]] in the mountains. Borvo and his [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]] [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] [[Adela Tyché]] easily evaded the pathetic tracking systems of the Naboo defense net, moving huge shipments of weapons artillery and even [[Spice/Legends|spice]] to the planet.

As the young Hutt's business continued to grow under the nose of [[Queen/Legends|Queen]] [[Padmé Amidala/Legends|Padmé Amidala]] and her administrators, he established semi-permanent operations on most other planets in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] where he did illicit business; while on Naboo he would sell [[Blaster rifle/Legends|rifles]] and [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]] to hunters, all perfectly legal, as fine cover in case his presence attracted the attention of the Naboo authorities.

He was also employed by the [[Trade Federation/Legends|Trade Federation]].<ref name="EG" />

===Invasion of Naboo===
When the Trade Federation [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|invaded]] Naboo in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]],<ref name="The New Essential Chronology">The video game itself refers to its events taking place during the [[Invasion of Naboo/Legends|Invasion of Naboo]]. ''[[The New Essential Chronology]]'' establishes on page 40 that the invasion happens in [[32 BBY/Legends|32 BBY]].</ref> [[Droid/Legends|droid]] scouts found Borvo's [[Borvo the Hutt's freighter|personal freighter]] and attacked it while it was cruising the mountains. Unable to defend itself, the ship's [[Kol Kotha|pilot]] [[Mission to the Naboo mountains|made contact]] with [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Gavyn Sykes]] and his [[Captain/Legends|captain]], [[Kael (officer)|Kael]]. Sykes saved the ship by destroying the attacking [[Armored Assault Tank/Legends|AATs]]. The treacherous Hutt [[Liberation of slave camps|pretended to help]] the [[Naboo (people)/Legends|Naboo]], but he later betrayed the men by killing Kael and enslaving the locals. Lieutenant Sykes took his revenge by [[Attack on Porso Hill|blowing up]] Borvo's freighter, [[Borvo the Hutt's starfighter|starfighters]], and depots. Borvo fled to [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]],<ref name="BFN" /> only to return at a later date. His crime empire eventually recovered and grew during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]].

===Galactic Civil War===
{{Quote|I guess you're all right to talk to. What can old Borvo do for you?|Borvo|Star Wars Galaxies}}
As the Clone Wars passed and the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] rose to power, Borvo continued to run his criminal empire from Naboo and with the Empire's strict control of goods and weaponry, his smuggling and gunrunning operations flourished. At this time, Borvo was faced with much competition from various other criminal organizations on the planet. He was also an acquaintance of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba the Hutt]] and was known to gamble and place bets with him. Shortly after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], Borvo was known to relax in the [[Moenia]] cantina on Naboo. There he sent [[Mordran]] to the [[Gungan/Legends|Gungan]] sacred place to destroy some Gungans that had crossed him. He had a [[Borvo's Vault|hidden base]] just outside of the town. There, he stored excess weapons and vehicles. His personal ship at that time was a [[Yacht/Legends|yacht]] called the ''[[Prosperous Secret]]''. Around that same time, he was discovered to have stolen a [[King Tusken Rifle]] from [[Huff Darklighter]]. In about [[1 ABY/Legends|1 ABY]], a [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] carried out a number of assignments for Borvo, including killing the Hutt's former partner, [[Montrus]]. Afterward, Borvo rewarded the spacer by giving them Darklighter's King Tusken Rifle.<ref name="SWG" />

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|He's sort of like Jabba but not nearly as mean.|[[Darklighter]] guard|Star Wars Galaxies}}
[[File:Borvo2.jpg|thumb|right|Borvo the Hutt]]
Borvo was very similar to Jabba Desilijic Tiure, both had vast smuggling networks throughout the Outer Rim and started their crime careers at very young ages. Borvo was also the top crimelord on the planet he chose to call his home away from home, and, like Jabba, he was faced with much competition on Naboo. Also like Jabba, Borvo had an eye for dangerous creatures, such as the [[Acklay/Legends|acklay]] and [[Rancor/Legends|rancor]] which he kept in his underground base. However, these creatures were used more as guards and it is unlikely, but still plausible, that Borvo fed his enemies and prisoners to them in the way Jabba also enjoyed to do. Borvo also enjoyed dancing girls just as much as Jabba, though it is unknown if he owned any himself.

Unlike Jabba, however, Borvo seemed more active in his business in that around the invasion of Naboo he seemed to make at least some his smuggling runs personally rather than having others do it for him. Like most Hutts, Borvo was not above betraying and exploiting others to serve his own ends. He betrayed the Naboo security forces by selling rescued prisoners as slaves and stealing [[Crystal/Legends|crystals]] from a Naboo [[Mining/Legends|mining]] site, even though they saved him and his ship. Borvo did, however, seem to hold great regard for those who impressed him and served him loyally, unlike Jabba. He hired Adela Tyché for her great piloting skills and being fluent in Huttese and other languages. He valued Mordran for his fighting skills and found respect for a young [[Spacer/Legends|spacer]] when they killed an old business partner who betrayed him.

These facts seem to support the claim that Borvo personally was not nearly as mean-spirited or cruel as Jabba, choosing instead to rule his criminal empire with generosity and esteem, much like [[Valarian/Legends|Lady Valarian]], which is most likely the cause of his great success. He even had some admiration for his enemies, when Lieutenant Sykes came after him, he admitted that he liked his attitude and offered Sykes a place at his side if he willingly surrendered, to which Sykes refused. Ultimately, despite his vast crime empire, Borvo himself seemed to keep a low profile, which he may have preferred as long as he made a profit.

==Behind the scenes==
Borvo first appeared in the [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo]],'' where he was [[Actor/Legends|voiced]] by [[Clint Bajakian]]. He later appeared in ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'' as an NPC, giving quests to the players.
