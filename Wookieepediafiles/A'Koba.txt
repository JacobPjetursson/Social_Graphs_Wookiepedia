'''A'Koba''', also known as '''URoRRuR'R'R''', was a skilled [[Tusken Raider]] leader who lived on [[Tatooine]] during the [[Galactic Civil War]]. Shortly before the [[Battle of Yavin]], A'Koba attacked [[Luke Skywalker]] before getting scared by [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]].

==Biography==
A'Koba<ref name="Rites" /> lived on the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] [[Planet|world]] of [[Tatooine]] during the [[Galactic Civil War]]. Shortly before the [[Battle of Yavin]], A'Koba attacked [[Luke Skywalker]], a local [[moisture farmer]] who, along with [[protocol droid]] [[C-3PO]], was searching for his missing [[astromech droid]] [[R2-D2]]. A'Koba knocked Skywalker unconscious, and the Tusken and his followers began searching Skywalker's [[landspeeder]]. They were scared off by [[Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], who mimicked the call of a [[krayt dragon]] to spook A'Koba and his fellow Tusken Raiders into fleeing.<ref name="Episode IV" />

==Behind the scenes==
A'Koba was played by stunt coordinator [[Peter Diamond]], who was the only stunt person on location in [[Tunisia]], in the [[1977]] film [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']].<ref name="Episode IV" /> Diamond actually only held aloft his gaderffii stick once. Editors [[Paul Hirsch]] and [[Richard Chew]] repeated and rewound such shot several times to make it seem Diamond had rocked it back and forth in triumph. A'Koba's famous bellow was added by sound designer [[Ben Burtt]], fashioned from [[Wikipedia:Donkey|donkey]] brays.<ref name="EoD">''[[Empire of Dreams]]''</ref> In [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]], the character was identified as [[URoRRuR'R'R]].<ref name="SWCG-ANHL:U">{{CCG|set=A New Hope Limited|link=ANewHope-Dark/large/urorrurrr.gif|cardname=URoRRuR'R'R}}</ref>
