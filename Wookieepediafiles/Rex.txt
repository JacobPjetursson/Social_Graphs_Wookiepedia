{{Quote|I used to believe that being a good soldier meant doing everything they told you. That's how they engineered us. But we're not droids. We're ''not'' programmed. You have to learn to make your ''own decisions''.|Rex|Carnage of Krell}}
'''Rex''', designation '''CT-7567''', was a veteran [[clone trooper]] [[Clone Captain|captain]] and [[Advanced Recon Commando]] who oversaw [[Torrent Company]] of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]]'s famed [[501st Legion]] during the [[Clone Wars]] and later served as a captain and [[commander]] of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] during the [[Galactic Civil War]]. Rex participated in many battles over the course of the Clone Wars. As the [[captain]] of the 501st, Rex served as second-in-command to [[Jedi General]] [[Anakin Skywalker]], whose bravery and unorthodoxy in battle he came to share. In addition to being a close friend of Skywalker he also became close friends with Skywalker's [[apprentice]], [[Ahsoka Tano]]. He was close friends with [[Clone marshal commander|Marshal Commander]] [[CC-2224|Cody]], with their relationship mirroring that of their respective Jedi [[General]]s, Skywalker and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], who Rex was also well acquainted with. Rex and his companions often worked together during the front-line campaigns against the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]].

Throughout his career, Rex proved to be an effective leader who truly cared for the men under his command, even as he began to doubt his own future&mdash;and those of his clone brethren&mdash;in the Republic. His leadership was put to the ultimate test at the [[Battle of Umbara]], when he was forced to lead the 501st [[Legion]] under the obstinate and aggressive Jedi General [[Pong Krell]], a secret Separatist agent. Rex's experiences with Krell forced him to reappraise his rigid adherence to orders, however this had not been the first time Rex had questioned his purpose and orders. A notable example had been during the [[Battle of Saleucami]], when he allowed the clone [[deserter]] [[Cut Lawquane]] stay out of the war. Rex used his combat skills and training to help train [[Onderon rebels|local insurgents]] on [[Onderon]] to [[Onderonian Civil War|emancipate]] their world. Rex's faith in the Republic was sorely tested by events such as the framing of Tano and the murder of his long-time comrade [[CT-5555|Fives]], who had gone rogue after unearthing an [[Order 66|anti-Jedi directive]] that had been [[Control chip|bred]] into all of the Republic's clone troopers.

Fives's death led him to uncover his inhibitor chip, which enabled him and his long-time friend Ahsoka to escape Order 66 during the [[Siege of Mandalore]]. After living on [[Seelos]] with fellow Clone veterans [[Clone Commander|Commanders]] [[CC-5576-39|Gregor]] and Commander [[CC-3636|Wolffe]], Rex joined the [[Phoenix Cell]] and reunited with his old friend Tano. Rex also became a reliable ally of the [[Spectres]] rebel cell and forged enduring friendships with the [[Jedi Purge]] survivor [[Kanan Jarrus]] and his [[Padawan|apprentice]] [[Ezra Bridger]]. During the [[Early rebellion against the Galactic Empire|early stages of the Rebellion]], Rex would use his skills and knowledge to help advance the Rebel Alliance's cause. He was eventually promoted to the rank of commander and fought in the climactic [[Battle of Endor]], which saw the [[death]] of [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]], the redemption of his former Jedi General Anakin Skywalker, and the destruction of the [[Death Star II|second Death Star]].

====Battle of Christophsis====
{{Quote|So if you're a captain, and I'm a Jedi, then technically I outrank you, right?''"<br />"''In my book, experience outranks everything.|Ahsoka Tano and Rex|Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)}}
[[File:Rex and Ahsoka.png|thumb|253x253px|Rex met Ahsoka Tano on Christophsis|left]]
Some time after the Battle of Geonosis, Rex accompanied Skywalker, Kenobi, Cody and the rest of the Republic forces in their effort to liberate [[Christophsis]] from Confederate forces under General [[Whorm Loathsom]] and [[Dooku]]'s assassin, [[Asajj Ventress]]. The [[Captain]] took part in setting up an ambush on the approaching Separatist forces, but watched on as Kenobi and Cody were ambushed themselves. Skywalker rushed to his master's aid, with Rex and his men alongside. Fleeing to the rooftop, they held off the [[B1 battle droid|battle droids]] until evac arrived in the form of a [[Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry|gunship]], with [[clone trooper]] [[Gus]] removing the commanding [[T-series tactical droid|tactical droid's]] head before departing. Rex then assisted Cody in performing a [[robolobotomy]] on the droid's head, discovering that it contained all of their intelligence. Surmising that this meant there was a spy in their midst, [[Jedi General|Generals]] Skywalker and Kenobi departed to investigate the [[Christophsis Separatist headquarters|Confederate headquarters]], hoping this would reveal the spy's identity. Rex and Cody were instructed to conduct their own search at the Republic base.<ref name="The Hidden Enemy">{{TCW|The Hidden Enemy}}</ref>

As they were leaving the command center, Cody noticed that someone had left their [[comlink]] on; their entire conversation had just been broadcast to the Separatist spy. Rex spotted someone in the corridor, and he and Cody gave chase. However, they lost him in the busy mess hall. The spy, they now realized, was a clone. Unable to reach the Jedi as a result of blocked communications, Rex had [[R2-D2]] analyze the communication history to see if anyone had sent out any unauthorized transmissions. He noticed irregular wavelengths that were too low and infrequent to be detected normally, wavelengths that were coming from [[Clone Sergeant|Sergeant]] [[Slick]]'s barracks. They proceeded to question Slick's men, all of whom had an alibi except [[Chopper (clone trooper)|Chopper]], who lies about collecting battle droid fingers. However, Slick slips when he reveals that he knew the Jedi were gone. Slick escapes, and manages to evade Rex and Cody while also blowing up the nearby weapons depot as well as many of the LAAT gunships and [[All Terrain Tactical Enforcer|AT-TEs]].<ref name="The Hidden Enemy" />

Following a lead from Gus and Chopper, Rex and Cody ventured back to the command center. There, they noticed boot prints that trail up towards the vents. Without a word between the two of them, Rex and Cody devise a trap; Rex pretends to leave the room, while Cody stands with his back to Slick's hiding spot as well as his gun. Slick slides out of the vents and points the gun at the back of Cody's head, but is shocked to learn that the [[Blaster|gun]] is empty as Cody took the clip out beforehand. After a short fist fight, Rex and Cody were able to subdue Slick, just as the Jedi returned from their fruitless trip to the Separatist headquarters. Skywalker verbally rebuked Slick for placing his brothers at risk, and Slick replied with a venomous attack on the Jedi's enslavement of his brothers, the clones. Despite Slick scorching the entire weapons depot, Rex and Cody note that they were able to save the [[AV-7 Anti-vehicle Artillery Cannon|heavy cannons]].<ref name="The Hidden Enemy" />

[[File:Got to hold out.png|thumb|right|271x271px|Rex inspired his men to keep fighting during the battle]]
As Loathsom's droid army moved in on their positions, Rex and his men accompanied Skywalker as he took on the [[Octuptarra tri-droid|tri-droids]]. Soon after, Rex met Skywalker's new apprentice, [[Ahsoka Tano]], laughing as she calls Skywalker "Skyguy," which for laughing he was told to show her the ropes as a commanding officer, offering her advice and valuable leadership experience. He also stated that while she may outrank him, it's experience that outranks everything. Before long, Rex spotted the [[deflector shield]] being used by the incoming Confederate forces, rendering their cannons useless.<ref name="The Clone Wars (film)" />

After conferring with Kenobi, Cody and Rex, Skywalker, and Tano left to destroy the deflector shield, while Rex assisted Kenobi in holding back the droids before they were able to destroy the heavy cannons. As Kenobi lead a charge against the droids, Rex and his men drew the droids into the buildings, making the fight more manageable for the clones. Despite this, most of Rex's unit was wiped out, and he was soon ordered to pull back his forces in order to protect the cannons. As Kenobi delayed Loathsom with a drawn-out surrender, Rex noticed the shield drop just in time and ordered the cannons to finish off the tanks, ending the battle.<ref name="The Clone Wars (film)" />

====Battle of Teth====
[[File:DeadDroidSergeant.png|thumb|left|292x292px|Rex with Skywalker, Tano and several other clones at the base of the mountain]]
Rex, alongside Skywalker, Tano, and the rest of Torrent Company, then went to [[Teth]] to [[Battle of Teth|rescue]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba the Hutt's]] son, [[Rotta]]. They used their ascension cables to climb the cliffs to the [[B'omarr Order Monastery|monastery]] under fire from two droid battalions. Rex and his men secured the monastery. After Skywalker and Tano found Jabba's son, [[Variable Geometry Self-Propelled Battle Droid, Mark I|Vulture droids]] attacked as two [[C-9979 landing craft|Separatist landing craft]] landed, deploying more battle droids under the command of Ventress. Rex and his men retreated into the monastery.<ref name="The Clone Wars (film)" />

Rex and his men stayed behind to keep the battle droids busy. After Ventress cut the door's lock, Rex and his men fought the droids, but the droids subdued his men. Rex picked up his pistol and tried to shoot Ventress, who disarmed and Force-strangled him, demanding the location of Skywalker. Rex refused, but Ventress used a [[mind trick]] to make him contact Skywalker. However, by breaking protocol and calling Skywalker by name, Rex alerted him that Ventress was coming.<ref name="The Clone Wars (film)" />

When Skywalker contacted Rex, a battle droid came over, and Rex punched it and took its weapon. Rex and his troops then fought the droids guarding them. As they were surrounded, help arrived from Kenobi and Cody. After destroying a spider droid with a detonator, Rex told Skywalker they could take care themselves and that the mission came first. Rex then went with Kenobi, Yoda, and Cody to pick up Skywalker and his apprentice from Jabba's palace on Tatooine.<ref name="The Clone Wars (film)" />

====Skirmish on the Rishi moon====
[[File:Rex inspirational.png|thumb|right|248x248px|Rex gave a speech to defend the base]]
Rex then went with Cody on a inspection tour on the [[Nu-class transport|''Nu''-class transport]], ''[[Obex]]''. After inspecting the tracking station at Pastil, Rex and Cody then went to the [[Rishi moon]] [[Rishi Station|station]]. En route, Rex contacted station. Rex noticed something odd about the trooper's reluctance to their inspection. After landing, Rex and Cody were greeted by a trooper who said that the base was fine and asked them to leave. Rex then demanded to be taken to the sergeant command, noticing the trooper saying "roger, roger." Rex and Cody then saw a droid attack flare, and he drew his pistol and shot the trooper. Rex then saw that it was a [[BX-series droid commando]]. They then came under attack by more commando droids that cut them off from the ''Obex''. Rex and Cody then jumped off the platform as the commando droids threw detonators at them. They then used their ascension cables to climb down.<ref name="Rookies" />

They then met the surviving troopers, [[CT-5555|Fives]], [[CT-782|Hevy]], and [[CT-1409|Echo]], who at first they ordered to remove their helmets to prove they weren't droids. After removing their helmets, they came under attack by a [[Rishi eel]], but Rex was able to shoot in the eye. Rex then marked Echo with the eel's blood and told them to follow him and Cody. Rex then pretended to be a malfunctioning commando droid by using a head from one and saying "roger, roger." After the droids opened the door, Rex, Cody and the rest of the clones then stormed the command center, taking out the commando droids. They then spotted a Confederate fleet approaching, but were unable to contact the Republic.<ref name="Rookies" />

When a landing craft came down, Rex said they would blow up the station so that the Republic fleet would arrive to investigate. Rex then rigged the gas detonators as Cody and others held up the battle droids. However, the remote detonator was not working. Rex and the others then left while Hevy fixed the detonator. However, Hevy refused to leave intending to set the gas off manually. Rex and the others then tried to go back for him but Hevy blew up the station along with himself. Rex and the others were rescued by a gunship. After Echo and Fives received medals for their bravery, Rex accepted them into the 501st Legion.<ref name="Rookies" />

====Battle at Bothawui & Skytop Station====
{{Quote|Rex ole'boy, it's time to join the party."<br>"With pleasure, sir!|Rex beginning the ambush onto the Separatist ships|Downfall of a Droid}}
[[File:ReportFromFalleen-DOAD.jpg|thumb|left|266x266px|Rex, Tano, and Skywalker receiving the report about Falleen from Kenobi]]
After the [[Battle of Falleen|fall of]] [[Falleen]], Rex, Skywalker, Tano and their fleet were sent to protect [[Bothawui]]. Rex and the fleet's [[All Terrain Tactical Enforcer|AT-TEs]] were then deployed on the asteroids surrounding Bothawui. As General [[Grievous]]'s fleet moved in to [[Battle of Bothawui|attack]] Skywalker's fleet, Rex and the AT-TE opened fire on the rear of the enemy fleet. Rex saved Skywalker when his fighter was damaged, then stayed with Ahsoka as Skywalker searched for Grievous's [[Skytop Station|spy station]]. When Rex and Ahsoka detected Skywalker's tracking signal, they took the ''Twilight'' and rescued Skywalker from Grievous's forces.<ref name="Downfall of a Droid">{{TCW|Downfall of a Droid}}</ref>

Rex then assisted Skywalker in his search for the listening post. After receiving a message from R2, Rex, [[Denal]], and his squad accompanied Skywalker in destroying the station in the [[Ruusan]] system. Rex also carried R3-S6 down to the station. Rex, Ahsoka, R3 and the rest squad were then sent to destroy the station's reactors while Skywalker searched for R2. However, R3 slowed them down leading to a confrontation between super battle droids. They were able to subdue the droids, however, Rex, Ahsoka and the squad were then confronted by General Grievous. Rex and his squad tried to shoot, but all were killed except for Rex and Denal. As Rex was about to be killed, he was saved by Ahsoka. Rex and Denal were then ordered by Ahsoka to complete their mission without her. Rex and Denal were then able to rig the reactors and rendezvous with Skywalker and the ''Twilight'' in the landing bay. However, Rex and Skywalker then realized that R3 was a spy when he summoned super battle droids and vulture droids to attack them. Rex then destroyed the reactors and they were then joined by Ahsoka and made their escape, with Skywalker rescuing R2.<ref name="Duel of the Droids">{{TCW|Duel of the Droids}}</ref>

====Battle above Quell and crashing on Maridun====
{{Quote|Captain Rex, keep your locator on. We should be back by day break with who ever, or whatever lives on this planet.''"<br />"''Got it General Secura. Hey kid, good luck.|Secura and Rex, with Rex saying the final part to Ahsoka|Jedi Crash}}
[[File:LibertyRescue-JC.png|thumb|right|243x243px|Rescuing Secura and Bly]]
Later during the conflict, Rex joined Skywalker, Tano, [[Admiral]] [[Wullf Yularen]], and several other clone troopers on a mission to the [[planet]] [[Quell]] where Jedi General [[Aayla Secura]] and her [[Clone Commander|clone commander]], [[CC-5052|Bly]], were fighting against a Separatist opposition. With Secura's cruiser damaged, the Republic forces were in a hurry. After breaking through a line of rocket super battle droids, they landed on Secura's ship, where Skywalker was injured in an explosion on the exploding ship. With fellow troopers [[Cameron]], [[Flash]], and [[Lucky]], Rex, Tano, Secura, Bly, and Skywalker escaped on a transport vessel. However, they were then hit and entered hyperspace. Their ship then crash-landed on the planet [[Maridun]].<ref name="Jedi Crash">{{TCW|Jedi Crash}}</ref>

Rex then stayed behind to look after Skywalker while Secura, Bly, Ahsoka, and the other troopers went to look for help. Rex then fought against the [[Mastiff phalone]]s alongside Skywalker until Bly, Ahsoka, and the [[Lurmen]] healer [[Wag Too]] came to his aid. Rex and his fellow clones and Jedi quickly discovered that Maridun was home to a Lurmen village.<ref name="Jedi Crash" />

====Defense of Maridun====
[[File:Clones maridun.jpg|thumb|left|251x251px|Rex and Bly on Maridun]]
Rex then watched for any spacecraft hoping for rescue. Rex soon spotted a Confederate landing ship coming toward the village. He informed Bly of this and then made their escape from the village before the battle droids arrived. Rex and the others then planned to steal a shuttle, but were then spotted by a [[Viper recon droid|recon droid]]. They then pursued it until Secura destroyed it. Rex and the others then watched as General [[Lok Durd]] prepared to test his weapon. Rex went with Bly to get a closer look at the weapon. Rex and Bly then ran to avoid the weapon's shockwave using their grapnel lines.<ref name="Defenders of Peace">{{TCW|Defenders of Peace}}</ref>

After Durd left, Rex worked with Bly and Skywalker to infiltrate Durd's base, where they were able to steal a shuttle and [[Deflector shield generator|shield generators]]. Rex and the group then returned to the village, where Skywalker, Bly and him built a wall to withstand, much to [[Tee Watt Kaa]]'s disapproval. Rex and Bly then activated the shield as the [[Defoliator Deployment Tank|Defoliator Tank]] fired its weapon. Rex and the others then [[Defense of Maridun|stood their ground]] until the droids breached the shields and destroyed it. Luckily, Rex, Bly and the others then had help from the Lurmen and were able to subdue and capture Durd. As Rex was taking Durd, Republic cruisers then arrived to rescue them.<ref name="Defenders of Peace" />

====Battle of Orto Plutonia====
[[File:Clones Orto Plutonia.png|thumb|right|236x236px|Rex and his troops on Orto Plutonia]]
Rex then accompanied Generals Kenobi, Skywalker, [[Pantoran]] Senator [[Riyo Chuchi]] and Chairman [[Chi Cho]] to [[Orto Plutonia]]. There, they investigated [[Glid Station]] to ascertain what happened to the troopers. Rex and the Jedi then went to Confederate outpost, where they saw a hologram of a creature attack the battle droids. Rex then returned to the station, where he and his troops waited for the Jedi's return. Rex and his troops then went with the Jedi, Chairman Cho, and Senator Chuchi to speak with the Talz Chief, [[Thi-Sen]] at the Confederate base. After the meeting was over, Rex was then charged with protecting the Chairman when he decided to attack the Talz. Rex, his troopers, Cho, and his [[Pantoran guard|guards]] were then surrounded by the Talz. When Cho was mortally wounded, Rex and his men retreated, carrying the Chairman with him. Rex then formed a defense line near a cliff and held out until Skywalker, Kenobi, Chuchi and the rest of the troops arrived.<ref name="Trespass" />

====Raid on Vindi's Lab====
[[File:Blue Shadow Virus.png|thumb|left|239x239px|Rex. Ahsoka, and several others stopped the droids form unleashing the virus]]
Rex was then sent to Naboo to assist Skywalker and Kenobi to stop Confederate scientist, Dr. [[Nuvo Vindi]], from deploying bombs laden with the [[Blue Shadow Virus]]. Rex then fought alongside Commander Tano in fighting their way through Vindi's [[Trade Federation laboratory|lab]]. They were able to stop Vindi's droid from unleashing the virus.<ref name="Blue Shadow Virus">{{TCW|Blue Shadow Virus (episode)|Blue Shadow Virus}}</ref>

However, [[LEP-86C8]] was able to steal a vial and trigger one of the bombs, contaminating the labs. Though Rex and his troopers were able to seal the lab, they were infected with the virus. Alongside [[Senator]] [[Padmé Amidala]] and [[Junior Representative]] [[Jar Jar Binks]], they were able to destroy all the droids but were also infected with the Blue Shadow Virus, and stop them from unleashing it on [[Naboo]]. Fortunately, Skywalker and Kenobi were able to administer a cure to them and save them.<ref name="Mystery of a Thousand Moons">{{TCW|Mystery of a Thousand Moons}}</ref>

====Battle of Ryloth====
[[File:Rex Resolute.png|thumb|right|243x243px|Rex watching Ahsoka's plan ]]
Rex, along with Skywalker, Tano, and Yularen then took the ''Resolute'' and their fleet to Ryloth to break the Confederate blockade. After their failed first attack, Rex and Skywalker gave Master Windu their progress report. After telling Tano that Skywalker wished to speak with her about their next attack, he oversaw the evacuation of the ''[[Defender]]''. After Skywalker left Tano in command of the ''Resolute'', Rex and one of the navagation officers worked with her to plan a way to eliminate the remaining blockade forces. At first, Rex and the officer were worried that Tano's [[Marg Sabl|maneuver]] would not work, but went along when Yularen agreed to it. After Skywalker destroyed the confederate command ship, Rex, Yularen and the navigation officer maneuvered the ''Resolute'' into the attack position. They then watched as Tano and her bombers destroyed the remaining forces. Rex then sent a ship to pick up Skywalker's and R2's pod as Kenobi's and Windu's forces landed.<ref name="Storm over Ryloth">{{TCW|Storm Over Ryloth}}</ref>

====First Battle of Felucia====
{{Quote|Come on Grunts! We are leaving!|Rex yelling for his men to retreat|Holocron Heist}}
[[File:RexFelucia-HolocronHeist.png|left|thumb|256x256px|Rex orders for his clone troopers to retreat.]]
Rex, Cody, Kenobi, Skywalker, Tano, and their forces eventually found themselves [[First battle of Felucia]] combating the droid army on the strategic planet of [[Felucia]]. Republic forces became based in a [[jungle]] clearing, and Tano was tasked with a jungle patrol to combat the Separatist forces. As Tano lead her troops against droid forces, the droid army located and surrounded the Republic position. Republic forces were soon overwhelmed, and their only hope for survival became a group of Republic [[gunship]]s called to evacuated them under the command of General [[Plo Koon]]. As droid forces surrounded Rex and the others, Koon, his starfighters, and his gunships were able to fight through the Separatist [[blockade]]. The ships were followed to the planet by Separatist [[Variable Geometry Self-Propelled Battle Droid, Mark I|vulture droids]], and the destruction and crash of one of the [[droid starfighter]]s altered Rex and the others to the arrival of the gunships. The clones fired at the approaching droids as Rex and the other Republic leaders lead them to the ships. Rex called for all troops to leave, and after all forces boarded they went to locate Tano's position. She initially refused to leave, and stated that the CIS troops were in retreat. Skywalker argued that the droids were regrouped and about to overrun her as Rex and the others did their best to fight out the droids. Skywalker ordered for her and her clones to evacuate, and as all Republic forces lifted off the regrouped droid army decimated Tano's abandoned vehicles.<ref name="Holocron Heist">{{TCW|Holocron Heist}}</ref>

====Battle of Devaron====
[[File:RexOrders-Devaron.jpg|thumb|right|235x235px|Rex and his troops were able to get a shuttle for the group to escape in]]
Rex then went with Skywalker and Tano to Devaron to stop Bane from taking the [[Kyber memory crystal]] from Master [[Bolla Ropal]]. Rex then gathered three brigades to board [[Cad Bane's Munificent-class star frigate|Bane's ship]]. Rex then approved of Skywalker's idea of using the [[All Terrain Tactical Enforcer|AT-TEs]] to board Bane's ship. Rex, Skywalker, Tano and their troops were successful in boarding the ship, though they did not save Master Ropal in time. Rex and the others then found Bane on the gun deck. Rex and his men fought the battle droids while Skywalker and Tano pursued Bane. They then secured a shuttle and waited for Skywalker and Tano to return. When they returned, Rex watched as [[Denal]] shot Bane.<ref name="Cargo of Doom">{{TCW|Cargo of Doom}}</ref>

After returning to the ''Resolute'', one of Rex's men then spotted blood. Rex told Skywalker the blood was not from one of his men. Rex and Skywalker then realized that Denal was actually Bane in disguise, who then made his escape.<ref name="Children of the Force">{{TCW|Children of the Force}}</ref>

====Second Battle of Geonosis====
[[File:RexBlastersGeonosis.png|thumb|235x235px|Rex on Geonosis|left]]
Rex then fought with Skywalker, Tano, and his troops when the Republic [[Second Battle of Geonosis|returned]] to [[Geonosis]]. After Skywalker's gunship were shot down, Rex and the others continued towards Kenobi's position on foot. Rex then assisted Skywalker and Tano in taking out a droid fortress blocking their path. After the fortress was destroyed, Rex, Skywalker, Mundi, Tano and the rest of their forces were able to rendezvous with Kenobi and Cody.<ref name="Landing at Point Rain">{{TCW|Landing at Point Rain}}</ref>

Rex then fought alongside, Skywalker, General [[Luminara Unduli|Unduli]], and Commander [[CC-1004|Gree]] and their troops to distract Poggle's forces while Tano and [[Barriss Offee|Barris Offee]] infiltrated the [[Geonosis primary droid foundry|droid foundry]]. At first, they were able to drive back the battle-droids. However, Rex, Gree and their troops were forced to fall back when Poggle sent in [[Super tank]]s to finish them off. After the foundry was destroyed, Rex brought in their tanks and gunships to search for Tano and Offee.<ref name="Weapons Factory">{{TCW|Weapons Factory}}</ref> Rex then saw Tano and Offee leave to recuperate.<ref name="Legacy of Terror">{{TCW|Legacy of Terror}}</ref>

Rex then accompanied Skywalker, Kenobi, Unduli and Mundi to deliver Poggle to Coruscant. Rex then stayed alert when Tano and Offee failed to check in time. Rex was then able to contact Tano and informed Skywalker of this.<ref name="Brain Invaders">{{TCW|Brain Invaders}}</ref>

====Battle of Saleucami====
{{Quote|Rex is a smart man.''"<br />"''Indeed. Always thinking on his feet.|Commander Cody and Obi-Wan Kenobi on Saleucami|The Deserter}}
[[File:RexLawquaneAndFamily.jpg|thumb|right|234x234px|Rex parted with Cut as equals]]
Rex then accompanied Skywalker and Master[[Adi Gallia| Gallia]] to the [[Saleucami system]] to [[Battle of Saleucami|rescue]] Master [[Eeth Koth]] from General Grievous. Despite rescuing Master Koth, Grievous escaped to the surface of [[Saleucami]].<ref name="Grievous Intrigue">{{TCW|Grievous Intrigue}}</ref> Rex then went with General Kenobi and Cody to track him down.<ref name="The Deserter" />

Rex and several of his troopers investigated the remains of Grievous' landing ship. Rex then took [[CT-5597|Jesse]], [[Hardcase]], and [[CT-6116|Kix]] through the wet lands to find Grievous. However, Rex was then shot by commando droid sniper. He survived, but needed a [[bacta patch]] and to be left behind at a [[Cut Lawquane's farmstead|farm]] to recover. He discovered that the owner of the farm was a clone deserter named [[Cut Lawquane]]. At first, Rex was disgusted by Lawquane's lack of commitment to the Republic. Despite this, Rex accepted his children's invitation to dinner. Rex then talked about how he would stay in the Army, no matter what happened. Rex was then told how Cut left the army after his team had been shot down, killed off, and then he ran. Rex and Cut's family came under attack by commando droids. Together, Rex and Cut were able to destroy all the droids, with Cut rescuing Rex from one. The following day, Rex decided not to turn him in, no longer seeing him as a coward. He then rejoined Kenobi's forces.<ref name="The Deserter" />

====Skirmish on the ''Coronet''====
Following Kenobi's investigation on [[Mandalore]],<ref name="The Mandalore Plot">{{TCW|The Mandalore Plot}}</ref> Rex, Cody, Skywalker and several troopers were requested to [[Skirmish aboard the Coronet|protect]] the [[Duke|Duchess]] [[Satine Kryze]] and her entourage from the [[Death Watch]] and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatists]] aboard the ''[[Coronet]]''.<ref name="Voyage of Temptation">{{TCW|Voyage of Temptation}}</ref>

[[File:JediCoronetBriefing.png|left|thumb|253x253px|Rex with the other Republic forces on the ''Coronet''.]]
Rex, Cody and their troops were then briefed on the importance of protecting the Duchess. They then stayed in the cargo bay. Rex then saw that R2 was spooked by something and that 2 of his troopers were missing. Rex, alongside Skywalker, then found an open container. They then continued the search until Skywalker was attacked by a [[SD-K4 assassin droid|Assassin probe]]. Rex and Cody were then able to take it out. However, they then came under attack by [[Probe killer]]s. After defeating them, Rex and Cody continue their search taking out the last probe killer. Rex was then attacked by the last assassin probe but was able to hold off its claws before Skywalker took it out. Rex then fought off [[B2 super battle droid|super battle droids]] boarding the ''Coronet'' alongside Cody, their troopers, and the [[Journeyman Protector|Duchess' royal guards]].<ref name="Voyage of Temptation" />

====Visiting Mandalore====
{{Quote|Excuse the interruption sir, but it is time to depart. General Fisto is expecting us.|Rex, to Anakin|The Academy}}
When Ahsoka Tano was chosen by the [[Jedi High Council]] to teach students at the [[Imperial Academy of Mandalore|Royal Academy of Government]] to help break the cycle of corruption on the planet, Rex accompanied Anakin and Ahsoka to the planet. While the two Jedi spoke with Duchess Satine and [[Prime Minister]] [[Almec]], Rex and another clone trooper stood by their ship. After Skywalker took Tano's lightsaber, due to a recent law passed that no offworlders could bring weapons to Mandalore, Rex approached Skywalker and informed him that it was time for them to go. Anakin, Rex, and the other trooper departed the planet for a meeting with Jedi Master [[Kit Fisto]], While Ahsoka stayed on the planet to teach her class about corruption. Tano ended up teaching her class, and in addition she helped uncover a conspiracy lead by Almec.<ref name="TA">{{TCW|The Academy}}</ref>

====The blockade of Pantora====
[[File:Anakin Captain Rex Padme and Ahsoka.png|thumb|right|235x235px|Anakin Skywalker, Captain Rex, Padmé Amidala, and Ahsoka Tano]]
In an attempt to force [[Pantora]] to join the Confederacy of Independent Systems members of the Trade Federation loyal to the Separatists, such as [[administrator]] [[Sib Canay]], arranged the [[blockade of Pantora]]. In order to push Pantora closer to the CIS, the daughters of the Chairman of Pantora, [[Papanoida]], were [[Kidnapping of the Papanoida daughters|kidnapped]]. During the debate around the blockade, Rex stood with Anakin as he spoke with Padmé Amidala. Padmé told Anakin how the situation reminded her of the [[Invasion of Naboo|blockade]] Naboo had went under, and Ahsoka Tano then ran up to the group. Ahsoka informed them that the daughters of Chairman Papanoida had been kidnapped, but despite this development Skywalker mentioned that the Jedi could not get involved. Skywalker however, also told Ahsoka that due to the Separatist involvement she could technically investigate on her own, but that he would have to make sure the Jedi Council didn't find out. Amidala asked if it was a good idea to go against the wishes of the Jedi Council, and Skywalker only responded that they did it all the time. This was all discussed while Rex was with them, which showed the amount of trust the Jedi had in him and their friendship. Rex of course did not report Skywalker or Tano, which also showed he also allowed for his friend to go on her [[Rescue on the Pantora Droid Control Ship|mission]].<ref name="Sphere of Influence">{{TCW|Sphere of Influence}}</ref>

====Balith civil war====
[[File:Nu-class transport with Captain Rex Anakin and Ahsoka.png|thumb|left|220x220px|Ahsoka watches as Anakin and Rex board a ''Nu''-class transport to go to Balith]]
When the planet [[Balith]] fell into a [[Balith civil war|large-scale civil war]], the planet requested Republic assistance. Rex and Skywalker were assigned to help the [[Third Legion]] on the planet, while Ahsoka was to stay behind on Coruscant to give a full report on recent events. As they were departing Ahsoka argued that she should go with the group, but Skywalker countered said that she had to finish her studies. Rex and Anakin then departed for Bailth on a ''Nu''-class transport.<ref name="Assassin">{{TCW|Assassin (episode)}}</ref>

====Battle of Kamino====
{{Quote|With all due respect, general, if someone comes to our home, they better be carrying a big blaster.|Rex|ARC Troopers}}
Rex, Cody and their troopers then returned to his homeworld of Kamino when a message between Grievous and Ventress was discovered. Rex and Cody then joined Fives, Echo, [[99]] and several young cadets in the barracks. Together, they [[Battle of Kamino|fought]] off the battle droids, but 99 was then killed. Following the battle, Rex promoted Echo and Fives to ARC troopers.<ref name="ARC Troopers">{{TCW|ARC Troopers}}</ref>

====Battle of Lola Sayu====
{{Quote|I am concerned that the Jedi have elected this... child to lead the group.''"<br>"''I've served with her many times and I trust her, Captain.|Captain Tarkin and Captain Rex discuss Ahsoka Tano|Counterattack}}
[[File:KoonBriefing-Citadel.png|thumb|right|250px|Rex and others attending the briefing about the Citadel]]
When Master [[Even Piell|Piell]] was [[Capture of Even Piell|captured]], Rex alongside Cody, Fives, Echo, Kenobi and Skywalker attended a briefing held by Plo Koon for a [[Battle of Lola Sayu|mission]] to rescue Piell from the [[Citadel]] on [[Lola Sayu]], where he was imprisoned by the Separatists. In order to get on the planet undetected, Skywalker had the entire rescue team, including Rex, [[Carbon-freezing|carbon-frozen]]. The frozen team was smuggled by R2-D2 and some reprogrammed [[OOM pilot battle droid|battle droids]] in a stolen Separatist shuttle. This tactic successfully fooled the life-form scanners of the blockade around the planet and its crew and the droids landed the shuttle in a cave close to the Citadel prison. After landing, Rex and the others were unfrozen, only to discover that Ahsoka Tano had secretly joined the team, despite having received orders not to do so. Since there was no other option, Ahsoka came along and the team began the mission.<ref name="The Citadel">{{TCW|The Citadel}}</ref>

[[File:TarkinRex-TC.png|thumb|left|200px|Rex with Tarkin during the escape]]
In order to get in the facility the team had to free climb a wall covered with [[electromine]]s. This went well until [[Charger|a clone trooper]] stepped on a loose rock and fell straight into a mine, alerting the prison crew of the team's presence. On the way to Piell's cell the team had to evade several booby traps, one killing [[Longshot|another clone trooper]]. The team made it to Piell's cell and destroyed the droids that were guarding Piell, with Rex taking care of the interrogator droid. On the way to rescue Piell the group was located by the Citadel's warden, [[Osi Sobeck]], who activated a large magnet in the ceiling of the hall that pulled all the team's weapons away, as well as Skywalker, due to his [[Cybernetics|cybernetic arm]]. The team was surrounded by droids.<ref name="The Citadel" />

Skywalker, being attached to the magnet, reclaimed his [[lightsaber]] and destroyed the magnet, allowing the team to reclaim their weapons and destroy the droids. Rex shot a surveillance camera, much to Sobeck's frustration, before moving along. After retrieving Piell's officers the group decided to split up in two groups while escaping the facility, as both Piell and his captain, [[Wilhuff Tarkin|Tarkin]], knew half of vital [[hyperspace]] coordinates, called [[Nexus Route]]. By splitting them up during the escape it would be more difficult for the Separatist to get the full information. Rex joined the group consisting of Skywalker, Tano, Tarkin, Echo, Fives and two rescued clones. While Kenobi and the other group wreaked havoc on the upper levels, Rex and his group escaped the tower into a series of tunnels on the lower levels.<ref name="The Citadel" />

Rex and the others then made their way through tunnels fighting off the super battle droids and commando droids. He also defended Ahsoka when Tarkin questioned her experience. They were then able to meet up with Kenobi's and Piell's team at the airfield. However, their shuttle was destroyed<ref name="Counterattack">{{TCW|Counterattack}}</ref> and ARC trooper Echo was believed to have been killed.<ref name="A Distant Echo">{{TCW|A Distant Echo}}</ref>

Rex and the others then made their to a rendezvous point as they were pursued by [[Single Trooper Aerial Platform|STAPs]] and [[Anooba]]s. During their trek, Piell was killed by one of the anoobas and Rex and the others gave him a brief funeral. They then reached the rendezvous point, where they fought against Commander Sobeck and his droids until Koon arrived. Rex and the others were then taken back to Coruscant.<ref name="Citadel Rescue">{{TCW|Citadel Rescue}}</ref>

====Return to Felucia and role on Mon Cala====
[[File:RexEverythingReady-WW.png|thumb|right|244x244px|Rex oversaw operations on Mon Cala]]
Rex then went with Skywalker, Ahsoka, Koon, Wolffe, and their men to take out a resupplied Separatist [[Separatist outpost (Felucia)|outpost]]. With the aid of [[Felucian]] scouts, Rex and Skywalker assaulted the outpost while Tano and Koon attacked the outpost from the sides. However, Skywalker noticed that Ahsoka had gone [[Skirmish on Wasskah|missing]]. Rex and his men then searched the outpost and the surrounding area for her to no avail.<ref name="Padawan Lost">{{TCW|Padawan Lost}}</ref>

Rex then oversaw the deployment of General Fisto's, Ahsoka's, and Commander [[Monnk]]'s [[Clone SCUBA trooper|SCUBA troopers]] at [[Mon Cala]] to [[Battle of Mon Cala|assist]] Prince [[Lee-Char]].<ref name="Water War">{{TCW|Water War}}</ref>

====Battle of Umbara====
{{Quote|Explain your actions.''"<br />"''My actions?''"<br />"''For ordering your troops against one another!''"<br />"''Oh... that. I'm surprised you were able to figure that out. For a clone.|Rex upon General Krell's attempted arrest|Carnage of Krell}}
[[File:RexSkywalker-Umbara.jpg|thumb|left|255x255px|Rex and Skywalker on Umbara]]
Rex, along with Skywalker, Fives and the rest of the 501st were then [[Battle of Umbara|sent]] to [[Umbara]] to help Masters Tiin, Krell and Kenobi to take it's [[Umbaran capital|capital]], while Tano and Offee fought the space battle. After the initially landing and fighting with the [[Umbaran]] [[Umbaran Militia|militia]], Rex and the 501st were then place under the command of Krell when the Chancellor requested Skywalker to return to Coruscant. Rex and his men were then pushed hard by Krell, who pushed for full frontal assaults on the capital. During the first attack on the road to the capital, Rex was forced to retreat, much to Krell's disappointment.<ref name="Darkness on Umbara" />

Rex, Krell, and the 501st were then sent to capture an [[Umbaran airbase|airbase]] that was resupplying the capital. Rex was then ordered to go through a gorge that would leave them exposed. Rex tried to reason with Krell to no avail. Despite the objections of Fives and the rest of the 501st, Rex convinced [[Captain Rex's squad|his men]] to carry out Krell's orders. As they made their way through the gorge, they were attacked by the Umbarans' [[Impeding Assault Tank|crawler tanks]]. Fortunately, Rex and his troops were able to destroy the crawler tanks. They were then confronted by the Umbarans' [[Umbaran mobile heavy cannon|MHCs]], which had heavy armor impervious to their [[RPS-6 rocket launcher|rocket launchers]]. To combat them Rex sent Fives and Hardcase to infiltrate their base and use their own [[Zenuas 33 Umbaran starfighter]]s on the MHCs. Despite Krell's orders to push the attack, Rex and his men were able to hold them off until Fives and Hardcase destroyed the MHCS. The base was then taken and secured despite the heavy losses.<ref name="The General">{{TCW|The General}}</ref>

[[File:RexvsKrell-Umbara.png|thumb|right|250x250px|Rex and the majority of his men did not agree with Krell]]
When Kenobi contacted them about the capital's long range missiles being supplied by a [[DH-Omni Support Vessel]], Rex proposed that they should attack the ship to cut off the supplies. However, Krell proposed to attack the capital despite the missiles, much to Rex's and Kenobi's surprise. Rex was then ordered to prepare the men for the attack, despite the heavy casualties. Rex at first complied, but was then told of idea by Fives to use the Starfighter codes to infiltrate and destroy the supply ship. However, Krell objected to it. Following a mishap in a hangar, Rex then gave Fives, Jesse, and Hardcase permission to carry the mission. However, he told them that if they were caught, he would not be able to protect them. Rex then watched as they took off on their mission and stopped [[Dogma]] and [[CT-5385|Tup]] from informing Krell. Krell then confronted Rex, who told him that he authorized a reconnaissance mission to make his strategy more efficient. Rex the saw the supply ships explosion. Rex, Fives, and Jesse were then brought before Krell, where he reprimanded them. Despite Rex's objections, Krell had Fives and Jesse taken to the brig for insubordination.<ref name="Plan of Dissent">{{TCW|Plan of Dissent}}</ref>

[[File:MarchToKrell-CoK.jpg|thumb|left|220x220px|Rex leading the 212th and the 501st to arrest General Krell.]]
Rex then spoke with Krell to convince him to spare Fives and Jesse, telling him that the men are with him despite his reckless tactics. Despite this, Krell ordered Rex and his men to execute them, but they refused to do so. Rex and Krell were then contacted by a trooper who informed them that they were ambushed by the Umbarans disguised as clones. Rex was then sent to attack the Umbarans. Rex and his men, armed with [[mortar]]s, then went into the jungle where they were attacked by the troopers. However, Rex then examined one the troopers and discovered they were clones. Rex then ran in front of both his men and the troopers, revealing the deception. Rex then spoke with the [[212th Attack Battalion]] platoon leader, [[Waxer]], who revealed that it was Krell who ordered the attack.<ref name="Carnage of Krell">{{TCW|Carnage of Krell}}</ref>

[[File:Rexecutioner-CoK.png|thumb|right|245x245px|Krell's execution]]
Rex then gathered his men and the remainder of Waxer's platoon together. Then, Rex told them that they would arrest Krell for [[treason]]. Rex and the men then confronted Krell, who was surprised that Rex figured it out. Krell, believing him to be committing mutiny against, refused to be arrested. Krell then pushed Rex and his men and made his escape into the jungle. Rex and his men then went into the jungle, where Krell taunted him. Fortunately, Krell was then subdued and stunned by Tupp. Rex and his men then placed Krell in the brig. During his questioning, Rex learned that Krell was trying to undermine the Republic so that Dooku or his master would make him his new apprentice and rule Umbara. When news came that Kenobi and 212th had taken the capital, Rex and the others decided to execute Krell. At first, Rex hesitated but Krell was then killed by Dogma.<ref name="Carnage of Krell" />

====Battle of Kiros and Kadavo====
[[File:RepublicAssault-Kidnapped.jpg|thumb|left|231x231px|Rex riding as Kenobi's gunner on Kiros]]
Ten rotations after Master Yoda last communication with Kiros' governor, [[Roshti]], Rex, along with Skywalker, Kenobi, Ahsoka, and their men were [[Battle of Kiros|sent to free]] Kiros from the Separatist occupation forces. Rex then rode with Kenobi as his gunner on his [[BARC speeder]]. Rex then finished off the last of the [[Armored Assault Tank|AATs]] with his rocket launcher as they approached the Separatist headquarter inside the [[governor's tower]].<ref name="Kidnapped">{{TCW|Kidnapped}}</ref>

Following the capture of Commander [[Darts D'Nar|D'Nar]], Rex went with Skywalker, Kenobi, and Ahsoka to [[Zygerria]] using the [[Tecora|''Tecora.'']]'' ''Rex, disguised as a Zygerrian guard, went with Kenobi to find the colonists. Rex was then able to spot Governor Roshti. Rex then attempted to escape with Kenobi and Roshti, but they were then captured. Rex then went to slave auction still posing as a guard. When Skywalker was able to whip Kenobi, Rex saw his signal and attacked the guards. However, he and the others were then captured. Rex, Kenobi, and Roshti were then taken to [[Kadavo]], to its [[Kadavo slave processing facility|slave processing facility]].<ref name="Slaves of the Repubublic">{{TCW|Slaves of the Republic}}</ref>

There Rex worked in the facilities' mines alongside Kenobi and the Togrutas as a slave. He and Kenobi were then brought before "Keeper" [[Agruss]], who was ordered by Count Dooku to execute them. However, Rex and Kenobi were able to free themselves when Skywalker, Tano, and Plo Koon came to free the slaves. Rex then killed Agruss. Rex and Kenobi then made their way to a gunship and left the facility before it was destroyed.<ref name="Escape from Kadavo">{{TCW|Escape from Kadavo}}</ref>

Following the battle, Rex was assigned by Skywalker to guard the Supreme Chancellor against bounty hunter [[Moralo Eval]]'s [[Skirmish in Theed|kidnapping]] plot.

He then went with him to the [[Naval Intelligence headquarters|military base]], where Commander Fox told him that Tano killed several clones. Rex, Skywalker, and Fox then searched for her. Rex then followed Skywalker to a tunnel, where they witness Tano escaping from them.<ref name="The Jedi Who Knew Too Much">{{TCW|The Jedi Who Knew Too Much}}</ref> Rex then assisted Skywalker, Koon, Commander Wolffe and a team of [[Clone shock trooper|shock troopers]] in searching for Tano.<ref name="To Catch a Jedi">{{TCW|To Catch a Jedi}}</ref>

====Banking Clan crisis====
Rex participated in the [[Invasion of Scipio]], a battle in response to the Separatist invasion of [[Scipio|the neutral world]] of the [[InterGalactic Banking Clan]]. While General Anakin Skywalker and other members of the 501st Legion made their initial descent on the planet, Skywalker requested that Rex determine the location of Padmé Amidala, who was on Scipio due to the exchange of power in the banks from the corrupt leaders to [[Rush Clovis]]. Rex said he could not pinpoint her exact location, but that the initial scan indicated she was still alive. Upon reaching the planet's surface, Skywalker ordered Rex to hold the line as he searched for Amidala. Rex, along with the rest of the 501st, successfully held their position and regained control of the planet from the Separatist forces.<ref name="CatH">{{TCW|Crisis at the Heart}}</ref>

====Rescuing Echo====
{{Quote|From Anakin I expect this type of disregard for authority, but Rex, i'm surprised you would be involved in such a reckless plan.''"<br />"''Actually sir this mission was my idea. If Echo's alive and being held hostage, we can't just leave him there.|Obi-Wan and Rex discuss the mission.|A Distant Echo}}
[[File:A Distant Echo.png|thumb|right|250px|Rex rescuing Echo]]
After the Separatists Admiral Trench made advances against Republic forces during the [[Battle of Anaxes]], Rex theorized that the Separatists had captured his comrade Echo, who was presumed dead, and that they were forcing him to divulge [[Rex's strategy algorithm|his strategy algorithm]]. In order to test his theory, Rex and Commander Cody joined forces with an elite squad called [[Clone Force 99]] (known as the "Bad Batch"); which consisted of Sergeant [[Hunter]], the assault specialist [[Wrecker]], the sniper [[Crosshair]], and the tech specialist [[Tech]]. The clones raided a Separatist cyber center on [[Anaxes]] and discovered that it was receiving an audio signal from [[Skako Minor]] that was beeping Echo's birthcode. This confirmed Rex's suspicions that Echo might still be alive.<ref name="The Bad Batch">{{TCW|The Bad Batch}}</ref>

Armed with this information, Rex [[Mission to Skako Minor|traveled]] to Skako Minor with Clone Force 99 and Anakin Skywalker on the ''[[Havoc Marauder]]''. After landing, Skywalker was kidnapped by a large flying reptile called a [[keeradak]] which deposited him in a [[Poletec]] village. Rex and the Bad Batch traveled to the Poletec village where they managed to make peace with the villagers and convince them to release Skywalker. With the aid of Poletec scouts, the clones and Skywalker traveled to the [[Techno Union]] city of [[Purkoll]]. During the journey, the clone troopers traced Echo's signal. When Crosshair suggested that Echo had become a traitor, Rex vouched for his friend and fought with Crosshair. Anakin broke up the fight and counselled him to be ready for such a situation. Rex accepted Skywalker's concerns but insisted on dealing with Echo himself.<ref name="A Distant Echo" />

The clones managed to trace Echo's signal to a tower and infiltrated it. Inside, they received a [[hologram]] message from the Techno Union leader Wat Tambor who announced that he had used the algorithm to lure them into a trap. When Tambor charged them with violating the Techno Union's neutrality, Rex responded that Tambor had already breached the Union's neutrality by bringing a Republic prisoner to Skako Minor. Tambor sent several [[D-wing droid]]s to attack them but the clones and Skywalker defeated them. Rex and Tech managed to force their way inside a [[stasis chamber/Canon|stasis chamber]] and find Echo. Echo was alive but many of his body parts had been replaced with prosthetics and he was kept in an induced coma. Rex and Tech proceeded to free him.<ref name="A Distant Echo" />

Rex and Tech managed to free Echo from the chamber after some difficulty. However, the clones and Skywalker were surrounded by Techno Union forces and unable to call for help since they were on an unsanctioned mission. When Tambor dispatched an [[Organic decimator]] to destroy the intruders, Rex, the other clones, and Skywalker managed to flee through an exhaust pipe. Wrecker then planted several [[detonator]]s which destroyed the Organic decimator and the chamber. While crossing a pipe, the clones and Skywalker managed to escape on four winged Keeradaks and return to the Poletec village.<ref name="Wings of Keeradaks">{{TCW|On the Wings of Keeradaks}}</ref>

At the village, the clones, Skywalker, and the Poletec villagers joined forces to destroy several D-wing droids and octuptarra tri-droids that Tambor had dispatched after them. During the battle, Rex managed to disable one octuptarra by firing into its eye sensor. Following the battle, the Poletec chief praised the courage of the clones and Skywalker. Rex also commended Echo for his bravery during the battle. The clones and Skywalker then headed back to Anaxes.<ref name="Wings of Keeradaks" />

[[File:Rexechounfinishedbuisness.png|thumb|left|250px|Rex and Echo]]
After returning to Anaxes, Echo devised a plan which involved infiltrating Admiral Trench's [[Providence-class dreadnought|dreadnought]] and feeding the Separatist systems with false information in order to secure a Republic victory on Anaxes. Rex, Echo, Skywalker and Force 99 infiltrated Trench's warship using the ''Havoc Marauder'' while Republic forces under Jedi Generals Windu and Kenobi attacked the [[Anaxes assembly complex|Separatist assembly plant]]. The clones and Skywalker infiltrated the dreadnought's interface unit and fed false information to Admiral Trench. Echo brought all Separatist forces to the assembly plant and then used a feedback pulse to shut them down.<ref name="Unfinished Business">{{TCW|Unfinished Business}}</ref>

When Admiral Trench realized the deception, he activated a time bomb in the factory's fusion generator. Rex and his fellow clones managed to fight their way through several battle droids and return to the ''Havoc Marauder''. Meanwhile, Skywalker killed Admiral Trench while Mace Windu used the Force to deactivate the bomb with the help of information supplied by Echo. Rex, his fellow clones, and Skywalker then fled Trench's dreadnought before Wrecker detonated it. At Fort Anaxes, Rex along with Echo and the Bad Batch attended a ceremony where they were awarded for their recent actions. Due to the Republic victory, Anaxes was able to continue producing warships for the [[Republic Navy]].<ref name="Unfinished Business" />

====Redemption of Quinlan Vos====
In the final years of the Clone Wars, Rex joined fellow troopers, including Cody and Jesse, to a [[Destruction of the Separatist supply storage base|mission]] to prove the redemption of the Jedi Master [[Quinlan Vos]]. Once the clones began to unload equipment, it was discovered that the [[Separatist supply storage base|asteroid]] they were on was about to explode. Quickly, the Jedi and clones escaped the asteroid, thanks to Vos. However, the Jedi was simply fooling all of them and was still an agent of [[Count]] Dooku.<ref name="Dark Disciple">''[[Dark Disciple]]''</ref>

====Siege of Mandalore====
Near the end of the Clone Wars, the former [[Sith]] [[Sith Lord|Lord]] [[Maul|Darth Maul]] had [[Takeover of Mandalore|taken control]] of Mandalore with the help of the Death Watch and his [[Shadow Collective]], a syndicate of crime organizations that had sworn allegiance to Maul.<ref name="Eminence">{{TCW|Eminence (episode)|Eminence}}</ref><ref name="Shades of Reason">{{TCW|Shades of Reason}}</ref>

Sometime later, Ahsoka Tano came into contact with the Jedi Order and requested the help of the Jedi in retaking the planet. Skywalker and Kenobi traveled to Mandalore, but were forced to return to Coruscant as [[Supreme Chancellor|Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] had been [[Battle of Coruscant|kidnapped]] by General Grievous.<ref name="Ahsoka">''[[Ahsoka (novel)|Ahsoka]]''</ref> <ref name="Revenge of the Sith">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref>

Skywalker was able to leave Rex and a battalion of clones on Mandalore to aid in the [[Siege of Mandalore|capture]] of Darth Maul. During the height of the Battle, Chancellor Palpatine had issued [[Order 66]], resulting in the clones turning on Tano, and allowing Maul to escape. However Rex had removed his inhibitor chip before Order 66 was issued, sparing him from being forced to turn on Tano. Eventually, Tano and Rex escaped and managed to fake their deaths before leaving the planet to live in exile.<ref name="Ahsoka" />

===Age of the Empire===
====Joining the Rebellion====
{{Quote|I fought by her side from the Battle of Christophsis to the Siege of Mandalore, and a friend of hers is a friend of mine.|Rex greeting the rebels|The Lost Commanders}}
Rex survived the Clone Wars and the Republic's [[Proclamation of the New Order|transformation]] into the [[Galactic Empire]]. Following the Clone Wars, Rex was living with Commander [[CC-3636|Wolffe]], the former commander of [[104th Battalion|Wolfpack]], and Commander [[CC-5576-39|Gregor]], an elite [[Clone commando]], in a modified AT-TE on the desert planet of [[Seelos]]. Several years prior to the [[Battle of Yavin]], Rex and his comrades encountered a group of rebels that included the [[Jedi Purge]] survivor [[Kanan Jarrus]] and his [[Padawan|apprentice]] [[Ezra Bridger]]. The crew of the ''[[Ghost]]'' had been sent by Rex's old ally, Padawan Ahsoka Tano, to obtain information on abandoned bases that the growing rebellion could use in their struggle against the Empire.<ref name="The Lost Commanders">{{Rebels|The Lost Commanders}}</ref>

[[File:Wolffe-4-retina 92972cde.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|Rex and Wolffe greet the rebels from Lothal.]]
Rex and his comrades' first encounter with the ''Ghost'' rebels almost ended in violence when Kanan thought the Clone troopers were a threat and ignited his lightsaber. Rex's timely intervention managed to break up the fight between his comrades and Kanan. When Kanan's apprentice Ezra mentioned that he and his rebel companions had been sent by Ahsoka, Rex quickly realized that the rebels were friends and introduced himself and his companions. While meeting with the rebels inside the walker, Ezra tried to convince Rex and his companions to join the fight against the Empire. Rex laughed and declined, saying that his days as a soldier were over. After discussions with Kanan, Rex agreed to create a list of bases that the rebels could use but invited the four rebels to participate in a hunt for [[joopa]]s as payment for supplying them with this information.<ref name="The Lost Commanders" />

To allay Kanan's distrust of clone troopers, Rex revealed that he, Gregor, and Wolffe had managed to remove their control chips. The rebels reluctantly participated in the joopa hunt with the [[Lasat]] [[Garazeb Orrelios]] acting as both the "hunter" and the "bait." Zeb was swallowed by the joopa but succeeded in killing the creature. Having completed their side of the deal, Kanan wanted his rebel companions to leave but Rex invited them to stay for dinner. While dining, the Mandalorian teenager [[Sabine Wren]] discovered that Wolffe had secretly alerted the Empire to their presence and hid the messages that Ahsoka had sent them.<ref name="The Lost Commanders" />

Wolffe, who distrusted the Jedi, had informed the Empire in the mistaken belief that he was protecting himself and his fellow clones. Rex was shocked by this revelation and confronted Wolffe. He managed to convince Wolffe that the rebels were their friends and that the Empire was their enemy. Shortly later, the clones and rebels were visited by an Imperial [[probe droid]] which damaged their auxiliary ship, the ''[[Phantom]]''; preventing them from rendezvousing with their fellow crew aboard the ''Ghost'', which was waiting in space. After destroying the probe droid, Rex and his companions prepared for the arrival of the Empire.<ref name="The Lost Commanders" />

[[File:Ahsoka embraces Rex.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|Ahsoka Tano and Rex embrace after years of being apart.]]
Despite Ezra's efforts to encourage Rex and his companions to join the Rebellion, Rex was adamant that the clones would stay behind to hold back the Empire while the rebels escaped on the ''Phantom''. A force of [[All Terrain Armored Transport|AT-AT walkers]] led by the [[Imperial Security Bureau]] agent [[Alexsandr Kallus|Kallus]], a perennial foe of the ''Ghost'' crew, [[Assault on Seelos|landed]] on Seelos. Despite being outnumbered and outgunned, Rex and his fellow clones stood their ground. At the urging of Ezra, the rebels intervened in the fight and managed to defeat the Imperials. Without air support, Kallus and his surviving [[AT-AT pilot]]s were forced to retreat into the desert. Honored that Kanan and Ezra would return to save them, Rex and his comrades saluted the Jedi and agreed to join the Rebellion. Hera then arrived with the ''Ghost'' to pick them up. Later, Rex met with his old friend Ahsoka in space.<ref name="Relics of the Old Republic" /> Meanwhile, Gregor and Wolffe stayed behind and turned the remaining AT-AT into their new home.<ref name="Relics Rebels Recon">{{SW|url=video/rebels-recon-inside-wings-of-the-master|text=Rebels Recon: Inside "Wings of the Master"}}</ref>

====Wits versus Discipline====
After joining the Rebellion, Rex became part of the Phoenix rebel cell, which operated a fleet in space. During one of Ezra's levitation lessons, Rex exposed Sabine and Chopper's trick that involved locking the astromech droid Chopper's feet to the floor, preventing Ezra from levitating him. When Ezra was upset about the trick, Rex told the young Padawan about how a Jedi General he had once fought alongside became a great warrior by combining [[the Force]] with his wits. In response, Kanan told Rex that the boy had a lot of wits but needed more discipline.<ref name="Always Two There Are">{{Rebels|Always Two There Are}}</ref>

While Rex and Kanan argued about how to train Ezra, the young Padawan sneaked away with Sabine, Chopper, and Zeb on a [[Skirmish aboard a Republic medical station|mission]] to salvage supplies from an Old Republic medical base. Rex had provided the rebels with the codes to this station. Unknown to the rebels, two [[Inquisitorius|Inquisitors]] known as the [[Seventh Sister]] and the [[Fifth Brother]] were waiting for them. The rebels barely escaped with their lives. Rex was present with Kanan and Hera when the younger rebels returned with news that the Empire had more Inquisitors.<ref name="Always Two There Are" />

Later, Rex oversaw target practice with Ezra, who was using a [[DC-15A blaster]] to try and hit a stormtrooper helmet that Chopper was moving around. Kanan came out, sternly reminding Ezra about his Jedi training, which sparked a minor debate between Rex and Kanan until Sabine informed them that Hera had called for a mandatory group meeting. The rebels then participated in a mission to scour [[Garel City]] for fuel cells to alleviate an energy crisis on the planet [[Rinn]].<ref name="Brothers of the Broken Horn">{{Rebels|Brothers of the Broken Horn}}</ref>

====Infiltrating the Imperial Interdictor====
An opportunity for Rex to resolve his differences with Kanan arose after Ezra Bridger and [[Commander]] [[Jun Sato]]'s [[CR90 corvette]] ''[[Liberator (CR90 corvette)|Liberator]]'' were captured by an [[Imperial Interdictor]] during a mission to the [[Del Zennis system]]. Prior to their capture, Sato had managed to warn the other rebels that the Empire had a new warship capable of pulling ships out of hyperspace. Under the orders of Phoenix Leader Hera, Rex along with Kanan and Chopper were to infiltrate the Imperial warship and rescue Bridger and Sato. For this mission, Rex and Kanan were to disguise themselves as stormtroopers while Chopper was painted black to mimic an [[Imperial communications droid]].<ref name="Stealth Strike">{{Rebels|Stealth Strike}}</ref>

When Kanan expressed unease about working with the former Clone Captain, Rex reassured him that he knew which side he was on. After Zeb brought two captured sets of [[stormtrooper armor]], Rex complained that the new armor was junk compared to the [[Clone trooper armor|armor]] he had worn during the Clone Wars. For their mission, Rex, Kanan, and Chopper used a stolen [[Sentinel-class landing craft|''Sentinel''-class landing craft]] to travel to the Del Zennis system, which they learned had been classified by the Imperial authorities as a restricted testing area. While traveling through hyperspace, the two men argued about their mission. While Kanan wanted to find their people and get them out of Imperial custody, Rex insisted on disabling the new ship as well since it could pose a threat to the Rebellion.<ref name="Stealth Strike" />

Upon approaching the Imperial Interdictor, Rex managed to con the Imperial scanners by telling them that his shuttle was having engine problems. Using emergency protocols he and Commander Cody had invented, they managed to gain permission to dock in the Imperial Interdictor. After landing, Kanan used a Jedi mind trick to convince the stormtroopers guard in the hangar to let them through. Accessing a terminal, they learned through Chopper that Ezra was being transferred to a secure cell; meaning that the Empire had learned his identity. Disguised as stormtroopers, the three rebels made their way to Ezra's cell only to discover that the young Jedi had already broken free and locked his captors in his holding cell.<ref name="Stealth Strike" />

[[File:Stealth Strike ep guide.png|thumb|right|250px|Rex and Kanan reveal themselves to Ezra.]]
Mistaking Rex and Kanan for stormtroopers, Ezra [[stun]]ned them with his [[Ezra's lightsaber|lightsaber-blaster]]. When Rex and Kanan recovered, Ezra tried to save face by claiming that they had been involved in a big fire fight. Chopper however played a holographic recording of what actually happened. While Kanan was furious, Rex laughed it off and suggested that Ezra should have set his blaster to kill in case if was not them. When Rex and Kanan broke into an argument about whether to limit their mission to rescuing their rebel comrades or destroying the ship as well, an irritated Ezra broke off and accompanied Chopper on a mission to sabotage the Imperial Interdictor's [[gravity well projector]]s.<ref name="Stealth Strike" />

Disguised as stormtroopers, Rex and Kanan continued their mission to rescue their rebel comrades. When they stumbled on a stormtrooper patrol, Rex advised caution but Kanan decided to attack them. During the firefight, Rex complained that he could not see through his stormtrooper helmet and threw it at one of his opponents, knocking him out. After braving heavy fire, Rex and Kanan finally reached the detention cell holding Commander Sato and his crew. They then decided to make their way back to Commander Sato's CR90 corvette ''Liberator''. On the way, they were attacked by more stormtroopers. Rex decided to buy his rebel comrades more time by holding off their pursuers and locking the blast doors.<ref name="Stealth Strike" />

Rex then took on the remaining stormtroopers in single-hand combat only to be stunned. Captured, Rex was brought before the Interdictor's commanding officer, Admiral [[Brom Titus]]. Recognizing Rex based on his code number, Titus tried to win Rex over by offering him immunity and reinstatement at an [[Imperial Academy]] if he would convince his compatriots to surrender. However, Rex rejected Titus' terms and the Admiral ordered an [[IT-O Interrogation Unit|interrogator droid]] to torture him to death while two stormtroopers pinned him down over a round portal. Meanwhile, the other rebels managed to reach Sato's corvette safely. After hearing Rex being tortured through the Force, Kanan decided to rescue the former Clone Captain.<ref name="Stealth Strike" />

Before Admiral Titus could finish Rex off, Kanan entered the command bridge disguised as a stormtrooper and opened fire on Titus' men. After freeing Rex, the two men escape on an [[escape pod]] and boarded Commander Sato's corvette. They then attempted to flee into hyperspace but were again pulled out by the Imperial Interdictor. However, Chopper had rigged the Interdictor's gravity well projectors to draw in everything nearby including two escort [[Arquitens-class light cruiser|light cruisers]]. These light cruisers crashed into the Interdictor; destroying it in a fiery explosion. Rex and the other rebels managed to escape into hyperspace in the nick of time. Following their escape, Commander Sato praised Rex, Kanan, and Ezra for rescuing him and his crew. Rex also thanked Kanan, who had managed to finally overcome his animosity towards Clone troopers. As a gesture of reconciliation, the two men saluted each other before they parted company.<ref name="Stealth Strike" />

====Escape from Garel====
Due to an accidental leak by Ezra Bridger on [[Takobo]], the Seventh Sister and the Fifth Brother learned that the Phoenix rebel cell was hiding on Garel. The two Inquisitors informed their Imperial colleagues [[Agent]] Kallus and Admiral [[Kassius Konstantine]], who sent an Imperial fleet from Lothal to attack Garel City. During the escape, Rex was with Commander Sato when their CR90 corvette was caught in the [[tractor beam]] of the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|Imperial Star Destroyer]] ''[[Relentless]]'', Konstantine's ship. However, [[Phoenix Leader]] Hera managed to free Rex and Sato by using the ''Ghost'' to ram into the Star Destroyer's [[tractor beam projector]]. This enabled the remaining Phoenix rebel ships to escape into hyperspace.<ref name="Legacy">{{Rebels|Legacy (episode)|Legacy}}</ref>

====Trouble at Concord Dawn====
[[File:Concord Dawn planning.png|thumb|left|250px|Rex present at the planning of the mission to Concord Dawn]]
Rex was present during a meeting with Commander Sato and the crew of the ''Ghost'' to discuss the establishment of a new hyperspace route to the [[Lothal sector]]. With the Empire hunting them down throughout the Outer Rim, the rebels were in need of a new hyperspace route that would allow them to bypass Imperial forces. During the meeting, Sabine suggested that the rebels try penetrating the [[Concord Dawn system]], which was home to a [[Mandalorian]] colony known as the Journeyman Protectors. Rex advised his fellow rebels that the Mandalorians who inhabited the planet [[Concord Dawn]] had helped train clone troopers during the Clone Wars. At the end of the meeting, the rebels decided to send a diplomatic mission led by Hera, the leader of [[Phoenix Squadron]], to negotiate for safe passage with the Protectors.<ref name="The Protector of Concord Dawn">{{Rebels|The Protector of Concord Dawn}}</ref>

Hera's diplomatic mission failed since the Protectors led by [[Fenn Rau]] had aligned themselves with the Empire. Under Rau's orders, the Protectors' [[Kom'rk-class fighter|Gauntlet fighters]] engaged Hera's [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor]]s in a vicious [[Dogfight over Concord Dawn|dogfight]] above Concord Dawn. Several rebel A-wings were destroyed and Hera herself was badly injured. Following the dogfight, Rex was present during a briefing where Sabine, one of the survivors, gave a report of the dogfight with Fenn Rau. Rex recalled that Rau had served as an instructor in the Grand Army of the Republic. With Commander Sato's permission, Kanan along with Chopper and Sabine took part in a [[Mission to the third moon of Concord Dawn|mission]] to destroy the Protectors' starfighters on the [[third moon of Concord Dawn]].<ref name="The Protector of Concord Dawn" />

====Mission to Geonosis====
[[File:Rex firing at ATDP.png|thumb|right|250px|Rex using the ''Ghost''{{'}}s forward [[laser cannon]] to clear the station's hangar of AT-DPs]]
Rex later accompanied the crew of the ''Ghost'' to investigate an [[ICM-092792|Imperial construction module]] above the planet Geonosis. As a veteran of the Clone Wars and a participant of the second battle that took place on the planet, Rex was aware that Geonosis was home to billions of [[Geonosian]]s. Thus, he was surprised when Chopper picked up no sign of life on the planet. Ezra then sensed through the Force that all life on Geonosis had been [[Sterilization of Geonosis|extinguished]]. Upon landing in the seemingly abandoned module, Rex stayed aboard the ship with Hera and Chopper while the other rebels went to explore the station. Shortly later, they discovered that they had stumbled into a trap set by the Imperial Security Bureau Agent Kallus.<ref name="The Honorable Ones">{{Rebels|The Honorable Ones}}</ref>

While Rex helped Hera to man the ''Ghost''{{'}}s defences against Imperial [[All Terrain Defense Pod]] walkers, Chopper managed to free the other rebels by unlocking the blast doors from the control console. Rex and the other rebels managed to escape the Imperial module aboard the ''Ghost''. However, Zeb was separated and escaped in an escape pod with Kallus. After escaping Imperial [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]], Rex and his fellow rebels began looking for Zeb. Despite sweeping through the system, they were unable to find Zeb which led Rex to remark that the Lasat had a slim chance of survival.<ref name="The Honorable Ones" />

Meanwhile, Zeb and Kallus landed on [[Bahryn]], one of Geonosis's moons. After working together to fight off [[Bonzami]] predators, the two struck an unlikely friendship. Zeb was able to activate his transponder and the crew of the ''Ghost'' were able to rescue him. Rex and the other rebels except Chopper greeted Zeb at the ship's gangplank after landing on Bahryn.<ref name="The Honorable Ones" />

====Finding a new base====
Later, Rex and several other rebels including Commander Sato, the Spectres, and [[Ketsu Onyo]], Sabine's friend, attended a briefing aboard the rebels' captured [[Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier|Imperial fighter carrier]] to discuss their plans to set up a new rebel base. By cross-referencing several Republic and [[Lothal]]ian star charts, the rebels had identified the planet [[Berzite]]'s [[Berzite's moon|moon]] as a prospective candidate. Since the rebels' fighter carrier were low on fuel, Ketsu recommended stealing [[fuel]] from the Imperial depot at [[Horizon Base]].<ref name="The Forgotten Droid">{{Rebels|The Forgotten Droid}}</ref>

As a result of the meeting, Commander Sato sanctioned a mission by the Spectres to steal fuel from Horizon Base. Rex stayed aboard the rebel flagship during the Imperial [[Attack on Phoenix Squadron (3 BBY)|attack]] on the Phoenix rebel fleet. After Chopper and the former Imperial [[inventory droid]] [[AP-5]] relayed information about an Imperial trap in the [[Yost system]], Rex accompanied the rest of the Phoenix rebel fleet to [[Atollon]]; a safe world with no Imperial presence.<ref name="The Forgotten Droid" />

====Defending Chopper Base====
[[File:Sabine Wren and Rex on Atollon.png|thumb|left|275px|Sabine and Rex outside Chopper Base]]
Following the discovery of Atollon, Rex was placed in charge of the establishment of [[Chopper Base]] on the planet. From the base's command centre, Rex commanded operations to deliver shipments to the base and to establish [[sensor beacon]]s that would serve as warning beacons for intruders. While Rex found the planet hot, dry, and unpleasant, he conceded that there was nothing trying to kill them. Later, he and Wren venture to the base's northern perimeter to investigate the disappearance of [[Lieutenant]] [[Dicer]], who had disappeared after planting her sensor marker.<ref name="Mystery">{{Rebels|The Mystery of Chopper Base}}</ref>

Under Hera's orders, Rex and Wren traveled there on the shuttle ''Phantom''. Upon arriving, they found Dicer's helmet but saw no sign of the rebel. Shortly later, the two rebels were attacked by several large spidery creatures called [[krykna]]. Wren managed to hold off the creatures, but Rex was taken captive. The krykna carried him down to their underground lair where he was held in the mandibles of a sleeping krykna which hung suspended from the top of the cavern. Sabine and the Spectres managed to free him but were pursued back to the surface by the krykna.<ref name="Mystery" />

Rex and his companions managed to make it back to the ''Ghost'' but the starship was held down by a large web woven by the krykna. As the rebels fought to break their way out of the web, Rex and Chopper aided in the defense of the ship by fighting off a krykna intruder trying to breach the rear hatch. While Rex kicked and pushed the creature out, Chopper closed the rear doors. After escaping the krykna, Rex suggested reporting to Commander Sato that the base was unsafe. However, Syndulla responded that they had poured much effort into finding the base and should not give up. At Jarrus's suggestion, the rebels erected a fence consisting of sensor markers around the base the following day.<ref name="Mystery" />

====Losing Ahsoka====
Rex kept in contact with Ahsoka Tano as she traveled with Bridger, Jarrus, and Chopper to the planet [[Malachor]] to seek answers on how to defeat the Sith. Holding Tano in high regard, Rex offered to come to her aid within two rotations. Tano declined the offer and reiterated that this mission was Jedi business. When Tano joked that she outranked Rex, he replied that experience always outranked everything. Tano then replied that she had more experience than him due to her experiences during the Clone Wars and Jedi Purge. Rex remained at Chopper Base for the duration of the Jedi [[Mission to Malachor|mission]] to Malachor.<ref name="Twilight">{{Rebels|Twilight of the Apprentice}}</ref>

In Rex's absence, the Jedi and Tano came into conflict with the Inquisitors and forged a tenuous alliance with the former [[Sith apprentice]] Maul to obtain a [[Sith holocron]] which purportedly contained the knowledge needed to defeat the Sith. After destroying the Inquisitors, Maul turned on the Jedi and blinded Kanan with [[Maul's lightsaber|his lightsaber]]. Later, the Sith Lord Darth Vader arrived and the Jedi and Chopper managed to flee but Ahsoka chose to stay behind.<ref name="Twilight" />

Following the mission, Rex and the other Spectres were later present on the runway when the ''Phantom'' landed at Chopper Base. They watched in silence as Jarrus, now blind, and Bridger disembarked from the ship. When Rex saw that Tano was not with them, he bowed his head in sadness at the thought of having lost a good friend.<ref name="Twilight" />

====Heist at Reklam Station====
[[File:Rebels on Reklam Station.png|thumb|right|275px|Rex (far right) and his team at Reklam Station]]
After Ezra and his team rescued the [[Weequay]] [[pirate]] [[Hondo Ohnaka]] from the [[Naraka prison|Imperial prison]] at [[Naraka]], Rex attended a briefing where Hondo shared information on the Imperial floating junkyard [[Reklam Station]] inside the planet [[Yarma]] to the Phoenix rebels and Spectres. After Hondo revealed that the Imperials were dismantling Old Republic [[Y-wing starfighter]]s there, Rex told his fellow rebels that the Y-wings were reliable combat fighters. In the end, the rebel leadership agreed to dispatch a [[Mission to Reklam Station|recon mission]] to Reklam Station.<ref name="Steps">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Steps Into Shadow]]''</ref>

Rex accompanied Ezra's team and Hondo on the ''Phantom'' to Reklam Station. On the way, the rebels exited hyperspace at [[Sereeda Waypoint]] where they were intercepted by a [[Mining Guild]] patrol. After escaping the Mining Guild patrol, the rebel team continued their journey to Yarma. While traveling inside Yarma's gassy atmosphere, the ''Phantom'' was pursued by two Imperial [[DTS-series Dismantler Droid]]s. While Chopper shot down one, Rex opened the ''Phantom''{{'s}} rear hatch and fought with the second dismantler droid. He almost fell out but was pulled back into the ship by Zeb. In the end, Rex managed to shoot the droid but the ''Phantom'' sustained damage. Fortunately for Rex and his team, Sabine regained control of the ship.<ref name="Steps" />

After parking the ''Phantom'' beneath the station, Rex and his team managed to convince the local Ugnaught laborers to help them steal the Y-wings in return for their freedom. After stopping the conveyor belt, Rex and the other rebels began refueling the starfighters. Rex commented that refueling the fighters would not be their first nor last complication. After the Imperial Commander Brom Titus activated the magnetic locks on the Y-wings, Rex and Ezra departed to attack the Imperial control tower. Rex was forced to return when a third dismantler droid attacked Chopper, Sabine, and Zeb.<ref name="Steps" />

Rex used a magnetic crane to trap the dismantler droid against a metal container before pushing it down into Yarma's volatile depths. The dismantler droid then erupted in flames. After Ezra cut off the station's power, Rex and the other rebels departed on the Y-wings. Chopper used the relay navigation system to remotely pilot the other craft. Rex then traveled in the same Y-wing as Chopper and the rebels escaped into the space above Yarma. The rebel Y-wings were intercepted by an Imperial Star Destroyer commanded by [[Governor]] [[Arihnda Pryce]]. However, they were saved when the Phoenix fleet arrived with the fighter-carrier ''[[Phoenix Nest]]'' and evacuated the fleet. Due to the efforts of Rex and his team, the Phoenix rebels obtained five Y-wings which were then transferred to [[General]] [[Jan Dodonna]]'s [[Massassi Group|unit]].<ref name="Steps" />

====Making peace with the past====
{{Quote|No... the war. It's not over!"<br>"Rex!"<br>"Cody!"<br>"Talk to me!"<br>"Ah, Kanan, I'm sorry, I thought you were someone else|Rex waking up from being stunned|The Last Battle}}
[[File:Ezra reasoning with Rex and Kalani.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|Ezra convinces Rex and Kalani to make peace]]
Facing a shortage of supplies, Rex, Kanan, Ezra, Chopper and Zeb traveled to [[Agamar]] to obtain [[proton bomb]]s from a wrecked Separatist supply ship that had crashed on the planet during the Clone Wars. After landing on Agamar, Rex took the opportunity to tell the other rebels about his Clone Wars experiences. When Ezra opined that the B1 battle droids did not look dangerous, Rex responded that these droids had killed many of his friends. Rex and the other rebels soon found the munitions depot and discovered that it was full of proton bombs. Before they could proceed further, they were trapped in a [[ray shield]] and stunned by several battle droids led by [[B1-268]].<ref name="The Last Battle" />

After awakening, Rex and his fellow rebels found themselves prisoners of the [[super tactical droid]] [[Kalani (super tactical droid)|Kalani]]. Kalani informed the rebels that he presumed the master control shutdown command issued to the [[Separatist Droid Army]] at the end of the war to be a Republic trick, and prevented it from disabling his battalion. Despite Rex insisting that the Clone Wars had ended and demanded that he and his friends be released. Kalani refused, stating that he would have one last battle; a victory for the Separatist Alliance. Zeb was the only one excluded from the battle on account that his species had not been involved in the Clone Wars. Though Rex, Kanan, and Zeb expressed their opposition to the war game, Ezra managed to strike a bargain with Kalani. If the rebels managed to make it back to the command center, Zeb would be free and they would take all of the proton bombs in the hangar. Kalani accepted these terms, and the "simulation" began.<ref name="The Last Battle" />

Unknown to the rebels or the Separatists, Chopper had evaded the battle droids and sent a distress call through a [[Sheathipede-class transport shuttle|Neimodian escort shuttle]]. However, the Empire picked up the distress signal, and Governor Pryce gave the order for the nearest Imperial fleet to deploy forces on Agamar to wipe out the rebels. Back outside the supply ship, Rex, Kanan and Ezra began the "simulation" as a large force of battle droids marched on their position. Utilizing a "sword and shield" maneuverer whereby Rex would fire and the Jedi would deflect incoming shots, as well as using two thermal detonators to wipe out large sections of the droid attack wave, the trio made short work of the first group of battle droids. They managed to reach the [[hangar|hangar bay]] only to find that Kalani had deployed three [[droideka]]s to intercept them.<ref name="The Last Battle" />

Unable to breach the droidekas' deflector shields, Rex and the rebels were forced to retreat. Rex and Kanan then agreed to provide covering fire while Ezra headed into the hangar to collapse a catwalk over the droidekas. Ezra was delayed by an unexpected reunion with Chopper but still managed to collapse the catwalk with the Force. Meanwhile, Rex was hit in the chest by a [[blaster]] bolt from a battle droid but survived due to his Clone trooper armor. While continuing their mission to the command bridge, they encountered Ezra. Rex chastised Ezra for his tardiness and warned him that one soldier's move affected everyone else in the team. In Rex's view, they needed discipline and strategy to succeed. Kanan counseled Ezra not to take the Clone trooper's words personally because Rex was determined to finish the battle.<ref name="The Last Battle" />

After Rex knocked out another droideka with his helmet, the rebels managed to enter Kalani's command center and declared victory. However, Kalani disagreed on technical grounds and prepared to execute Rex. Before any further violence could break out, Ezra interceded and convinced the two sides to put aside their differences. After Imperial forces landed on Agamar and attacked B1-268 and a battle droid patrol, Ezra managed to win over Kalani to their side by pointing out that the Empire was the successor to the tyranny of the Old Republic. Kalani accepted Ezra's logic and agreed to help the rebels formulate an escape plan.<ref name="The Last Battle" />

=====An unofficial end=====
{{Dialogue|Rex|No, it was a victory. We all just won the Clone War, and you ended it Ezra. A galaxy of senators couldn't do that. An army of Jedi, clones, and droids couldn't find the middle ground, but you did.|Ezra|Rex, all I did was point out that none of you were meant to win. You couldn't.|Rex|And we needed to hear it.|Kalani|Agreed. I am satisfied if you are, Captain.|Rex|I am.|attr=Rex, Ezra Bridger, and Kalani|src=The Last Battle}}
Working together, Kalani, Rex, and the rebels improvised a strategy which involved rolling the proton torpedoes onto the feet of the advancing Imperial AT-AT and AT-DP walkers. When Kalani admitted never attempting such a desperate strategy, Rex responded that was why the Clone troopers won; prompting Kalani to reply "not always." After knocking out one of the AT-AT walkers, the rebels and droids fled aboard three Neimoidian escort shuttles while under fire from the Imperial walkers. One of the shuttles was shot down but the rebels' and Kalani's shuttles managed to escape into space.<ref name="The Last Battle" />

Once in space, Rex and the rebels corresponded with Kalani by hologram. When Kalani opined that their joint effort was a successful strategy but not a victory, Rex opined that it was a victory and thanked Ezra for finding a middle ground that allowed the clones and droids to end the Clone Wars. Both Rex and Kalani also accepted Ezra's explanation that both sides could not win the Clone Wars. Despite departing on friendly terms, Kalani thought that the rebellion had a poor chance of success and parted for parts unknown. Rex and the other rebels were later contacted by Hera. Despite not obtaining the proton bombs, they managed to acquire a [[Phantom II|new transport]] for the ''Ghost''.<ref name="The Last Battle" />

====Evacuation of Mykapo====
Rex and the Phoenix Squadron took part in a [[Skirmish over Mykapo|mission]] to evacuate rebel sympathizers from the planet [[Mykapo]] prior to an Imperial crackdown. After the ''Ghost'' and a local rebel cell called the [[Iron Squadron]] destroyed an Imperial advance patrol, Rex and the crew of a [[Sphyrna-class corvette|''Sphyrna''-class corvette]] evacuated the rebel sympathizers to safety. Rex contacted Hera and Kanan to inform them that he would be rendezvousing with the rebel fleet. Later, Rex corresponded with Hera and her crew by hologram while discussing a plan to rescue the Iron Squadron captain [[Mart Mattin]] from Imperial forces. This mission was ultimately successful and Mart managed to reunite with his uncle Commander Sato.<ref name="Iron Squadron">{{Rebels|Iron Squadron (episode)|Iron Squadron}}</ref>

====The spectre of Maul====
Rex along with the Spectres and other members of Phoenix Squadron attended a briefing chaired by Hera Syndulla to discuss a planned strike against the [[Imperial Armory Complex]] on the planet Lothal. During the meeting, Ezra saw the former Sith apprentice Maul sneak past Rex. Using the [[Dark side of the Force]] and [[Nightsisters|Nightsister]] [[Magick]], Maul haunted Ezra and caused him to faint. As a result, Hera proceeded on the Lothal mission without Ezra.<ref name="Visions and Voices">{{Rebels|Visions and Voices}}</ref>

====Mission to Geonosis====
[[File:Spectres and Rex on Geonosis.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|Rex and members of the Spectres on Geonosis]]
Rex later accompanied the crew of the ''Ghost'' on a [[Mission to investigate Geonosis|mission]] to find [[Saw Gerrera]] and investigate the apparent disappearance of the Geonosian species on Geonosis at the request of Senator [[Bail Organa]]; a key ally of the rebellion. Rex explained to the Spectres that he and Saw had fought as allies during the [[Clone Wars]]. He also warned his fellow rebels to be worried about what Saw did not find on Geonosis. The rebels landed near the Geonosian structure that Saw had last entered before losing contact with [[Alliance High Command|Rebel Command]].<ref name="Ghosts">{{Rebels|Ghosts of Geonosis}}</ref>

While exploring an underground labyrinth, Rex along with Kanan, Ezra, and Chopper found several discarded helmets belonging to Saw's team. Kanan and Chopper wanted to leave but Ezra and Rex were determined to find Saw and to complete their mission. After reaching a dead end, the rebels were cornered by several battle droids and a droideka. Before the battle droids could finish off the rebels, Saw arrived and eliminated most of them with a grenade.<ref name="Ghosts" />

After greeting his former comrade in arms, Rex and his fellow rebels agreed to help Saw find the lone Geonosian, who had ambushed and killed his group. Saw believed that the Geonosian held the key as to why the Empire had wiped out the entire population of Geonosis. Rex, the Spectres, and Saw eventually reached the central air shaft. After Kanan contacted Hera to warn about the operational battle droids, the rebels discovered the lone Geonosian on the other side of the shaft.<ref name="Ghosts" />

While Ezra and Chopper pursued the Geonosian, Kanan used the Force to levitate Rex and Saw on a stone bridge over to the other side. Following a protracted pursuit, Rex and his comrades managed to capture the Geonosian. While Saw was hostile to the Geonosian due to his animosity towards the Separatists, Ezra managed to befriend the Geonosian, who was nicknamed "[[Klik-Klak]]." While making their way to an energy reading picked up by Chopper, Rex explained that Saw was still affected by the death of his sister [[Steela Gerrera]] at the hands of the Separatists.<ref name="Ghosts" />

The rebels soon discovered that the source of the energy reading was [[Klik-Klak's nest]], which contained a working transmitter. While Rex and Chopper worked to establish contact with Hera, Saw and Ezra argued about Klik-Klak; who revealed that he was the custodian of the last Geonosian queen's egg. While Saw wanted to interrogate Klik-Klak offworld, Ezra insisted that Klik-Klak belonged on Geonosis since he was one of the few surviving members of his species. When Saw expressed his dislike for the Geonosians, Rex reminded him that his mission was to find out what had happened to the Geonosian species. In the end, Kanan brokered a compromise which involved bringing Klik-Klak to Chopper Base for interrogation and returning him to Geonosis once they had finished with him.<ref name="Ghosts" />

After establishing contact with Hera, the rebels arranged to rendezvous with her at the central air shaft. After boarding the ''Ghost'', Rex and the Spectres became involved in an argument with Saw over the treatment of Klik-Klak. Saw broke his agreement with Kanan and demanded that the rebels let him leave with Klik-Klak and the Geonosian egg. During the argument, Saw electrocuted Klik-Klak with an electro-shock device, which prompted Ezra to lunge at him. Rex tried to restrain Saw but the other rebel knocked him to the ground. When Saw threatened to destroy the Geonosian queen egg, Rex reminded him that doing so would sully the memory of his sister.<ref name="Ghosts" />

The rebels' argument was interrupted by the arrival of an [[Brunson's Arquitens-class command cruiser|''Arquitens''-class command cruiser]] commanded by Captain [[Brunson]]. Rex and his fellow rebels and Saw joined forces to repel a boarding party of [[Jumptrooper]]s. During the skirmish, Rex used the ''Ghost''{{'s}} laser turret to blast several of the Jumptroopers. The ''Ghost'' then fled into the depths of Geonosis. There, the rebels and Saw discovered several Imperial poison canisters which the Empire had used to exterminate the Geonosians. Having found compelling evidence of the Imperial genocide, Saw experienced a change of heart and let Klik-Klak flee with the Geonosian queen egg into the depths of Geonosis.<ref name="Ghosts" />

The rebels then fought their way out of the air shaft by blasting Brunson's light cruiser with [[proton torpedo]]es. They then informed Senator Organa and Commander Sato about their successful rescue of Saw, their acquisition of a [[deflector core]], and their discovery of the Imperial genocide against the Geonosians.<ref name="Ghosts" />

====Rescuing Kallus====
After the rebels learned that Grand Admiral Thrawn was monitoring the rogue ISB Agent Kallus's Fulcrum transmissions, Rex took part in a rebel mission to rescue Kallus before the Empire captured him. As part of the [[Rescue of Alexsandr Kallus|mission]], Ezra, Chopper and AP-5 stole a shuttle from the planet Lothal's [[Capital City spaceport]] and allowed themselves to be captured by Kallus' Imperial light cruiser, which was captained by Lieutenant [[Yogar Lyste]]. Disguised as stormtroopers, Rex and Kanan then traveled in the ''Sentinel''-class landing craft [[TY997]] to Lyste's light cruiser to facilitate the extraction.<ref name="TIE">{{Rebels|Through Imperial Eyes}}</ref>

The rebel mission was complicated when Grand Admiral Thrawn requested an audience with Kallus and Lieutenant Lyste aboard his Imperial Star Destroyer ''[[Chimaera]]''. After reaching the ''Chimaera'', Chopper informed Rex and Kanan about the change of plans. While Rex expressed shock, Kanan told Chopper to get them a fresh set of coordinates for the ''Chimaera'' since their current coordinates would only work on the Imperial light cruiser. Chopper complied and managed to obtain the new set of coordinates with the help of Kallus and Ezra.<ref name="TIE" />

After exiting hyperspace, Rex and Kanan discovered Thrawn's [[Seventh Fleet]] orbiting Lothal. When Kanan asked which ship, Rex told him to transmit the coordinates at random. TY997 was cleared for landing aboard the ''Chimaera''. However, Thrawn had discovered that rebel infiltrators were aboard the shuttle and sent Governor Pryce to apprehend the intruders. Pryce saw through their stormtrooper disguises and ordered Rex and Kanan to surrender. When Kanan protested, Pryce stunned him.<ref name="TIE" />

Rex then shot one of Pryce's stormtroopers before fighting hand to hand combat with the Governor. Pryce managed to overpower Rex and knock him to the ground. However, Lieutenant Lyste, mistaking Pryce for Fulcrum, stunned her. Before Lyste could attend to Rex, Kallus tackled him to the ground. Rex and his fellow rebels then fled aboard their landing craft. Kallus opted to stay behind in order to continue helping the rebellion. He also framed Lyste as Fulcrum in an effort to draw attention away from himself but Thrawn was not fooled.<ref name="TIE" />

====Alliance to Restore the Republic====
=====Mon Mothma's speech=====
Later, Rex along with Commander Sato and AP-5 were present at the Chopper Base command center when the former Imperial Senator [[Mon Mothma]] gave a live [[HoloNet]] speech denouncing the Empire and urging the galaxy to rise up in rebellion.<ref name="Secret Cargo" />

=====Ezra's errant mission=====
After Ezra Bridger heard [[Kanan Jarrus' holocron]] and the [[Sith holocron (Malachor)|Malachor Sith holocron]] warning that the [[Jedi Master]] Obi-Wan Kenobi was in danger, Rex attended a meeting with Bridger, Commander Sato, and the other Spectres including Phoenix Leader Syndulla. During the meeting, Rex expressed sympathy for Bridger's desire to find Kenobi, but believed that Kenobi had perished, citing a report from Senator Bail Organa. Bridger disagreed and traveled with Chopper on a [[Mission to Tatooine (Imperial Era)|mission]] to find Kenobi. Bridger found that Kenobi was indeed alive and that Maul was no longer a problem.<ref name="Twin Suns">{{Rebels|Twin Suns (episode)|Twin Suns}}</ref>

=====Defending Chopper Base=====
Rex took part in the [[Battle of Atollon]]. Before the Phoenix Squadron and General Jan Dodonna's Massassi Group could launch a coordinate attack on the Imperial TIE Defender factories on Lothal, Grand Admiral Thrawn learned the location of Chopper Base and invaded the [[Atollon system]]. In response, Hera devised a plan to sneak Ezra and Chopper out of the system aboard the Gauntlet fighter ''Nightbrother'' while launching a frontal attack on Thrawn's Seventh Fleet. Prior to the battle, Zeb and Rex joked about hunting joopas with Rex remarking they were hard to hunt but tasty.<ref name="Zero Hour">{{Rebels|Zero Hour}}</ref>

During the space battle, Rex and Zeb manned the guns aboard the ''Ghost''. After Commander Sato sacrificed his life and command ship ''Phoenix Nest'' by ramming Admiral Konstantine's [[interdictor vessel]], Ezra and Chopper were able to escape and seek reinforcements from [[Clan Wren]]. However, the rebel forces sustained heavy casualties at the hands of Thrawn's fleet and were forced to retreat to Atollon. Rex and Zeb managed to activate Sabine's prototype deflector shield generator, creating an umbrella above Chopper Base and the remaining rebel ships.<ref name="Zero Hour" />

Despite the shield generator taking heavy damage, Rex and Zeb were pleased when the shields appeared to hold up. After Thrawn deployed ground forces, Dodonna theorized that Thrawn would send his forces through the narrow canyon leading to Chopper Base. Rex proposed guarding the passes, which Hera approved. Rex destroyed several of Thrawn's AT-DP walkers with detonators while Zeb destroyed the last one with a rocket launcher. However, the two rebels were forced to retreat when Thrawn deployed several AT-AT walkers, which were protected by shield generators.<ref name="Zero Hour" />

After reuniting with Kanan, the three rebels fled into the caves under the [[Atollon Coral Mesa]] and fought against Thrawn's [[death trooper]]s and [[stormtrooper]]s. After reuniting with Hera, General Dodonna, and AP-5, they tried to flee to the ''Ghost'' but were surrounded by Thrawn and his death troopers. Before Thrawn could take them prisoner, Kanan's mysterious friend [[Bendu]], the enigmatic Force-wielder, unleashed a thunder storm which devastated the base. Rex and his rebel comrades fled aboard the ''Ghost'' and joined the rebel fleet in space.<ref name="Zero Hour" />

By that stage, Ezra had returned with Mandalorian reinforcements led by Sabine and Fenn Rau. The Mandalorians destroyed Thrawn's second interdictor cruiser, allowing the rebel remnants to flee into hyperspace. Under the orders of Hera, the rebel convoy set a course for [[Yavin 4]]. When AP-5 proposed doing two jumps to cover their tracks, Rex recommended a third jump.<ref name="Zero Hour" />

=====The Massassi Group=====
Following the Battle of Atollon, Rex and the other surviving members of Phoenix Squadron joined the Massassi Group, a Rebel Alliance unit based on the jungle moon Yavin 4. Rex, several Spectres, and rebel ground crew were present at the airfield outside the [[Great Temple (Yavin 4)|Great Temple]] when Hera's squadron of Y-wings landed. Since the fighters had sustained damaged, the Y-wings including Hera's starfighter had trouble landing. Rex remained on Yavin 4 while the Specters undertook a [[Mission to Jalindi|mission]] to destroy the [[Jalindi relay|Imperial relay]] on [[Jalindi]].<ref name="In the Name">{{Rebels|In the Name of the Rebellion}}</ref>

Later, Rex and the former Imperial Security Bureau Agent Alexsandr Kallus accompanied the Specters on an [[Theft of the TIE Defender Elite|undercover mission]] to the Imperial-occupied planet of Lothal. Hera placed Rex in charge of looking after the ''Ghost'' while the Spectres infiltrated Lothal aboard [[Cikatro Vizago]]'s freighter ''[[Broken Horn]]''.<ref name="The Occupation">{{Rebels|The Occupation}}</ref>

=====Mustering allies=====
Following the Spectres' [[Mission to the Lothal Jedi Temple|mission]] to the [[Lothal Jedi Temple]], Rex accompanied Captain Syndulla and Kallus on a trip to the planet Seelos to recruit several old friends of Ezra to assist in the [[liberation of Lothal]]. As the ''Ghost'' entered Seelos' atmosphere, Rex contacted his fellow Clone veterans Gregor and Wolffe; who had settled in a former AT-AT walker known as [[Joopa Base]] that was roaming G872.<ref name="A Fool's Hope">{{Rebels|A Fool's Hope}}</ref>

At Joopa Base, Rex and his rebel comrades encountered Gregor, Wolffe, the Weequay pirate Hondo Ohnaka, his [[Ugnaught]] companion [[Melch]], and the Mandalorian bounty hunter Ketsu Onyo. Rex, Hera, and Kallus managed to recruit the group to participate in the liberation of Lothal as a favor to Ezra.<ref name="A Fool's Hope" />

While traveling back to Lothal, the rebels waited in space at Hondo's suggestion to catch a ride on an Imperial [[Class four container transport]]. As they waited, Rex doubted that Ezra and the others could hold out against Governor Pryce's forces. Shortly later, the container transport arrived and the rebels were able to latch the ''Ghost'' onto the ship. Upon arriving at the [[Lothal cliff dwelling]], Rex along with Gregor, Wolffe, and Kallus help the other Spectres and Ryder's rebel forces to defeat Pryce's remaining troops and capture the Imperial Governor.<ref name="A Fool's Hope" />

=====Liberating Lothal=====
Captain Rex participated in an operation to infiltrate the [[Imperial Complex (Lothal)|"Dome"]] alongside Wolffe, Gregor, and multiple other allies. The center of Imperial power on Lothal, the Dome was a mobile [[Imperial Planetary Occupation Facility]] that was equipped with thrusters. The rebels used two captured [[LAAT/le gunship|patrol transports]] to fly to the Dome. For the operation, Rex disguised himself as a stormtrooper. During the flight, Rex reassured a skeptical Gregor that Ezra's plan would work because he was a [[Jedi]].<ref name="Family&Farewell">{{Rebels|Family Reunion – and Farewell}}</ref>

With the help of an unwilling Governor Pryce, the rebels managed to land at the Dome's executive landing pad. Following a brief battle, the rebels managed to capture the command center. With the help of [[Ryder Azadi]], the rebels issued a faux [[Protocol 13]] which caused the Imperial garrison on Lothal to evacuate aboard the Dome. Before the rebels could launch the mobile base, Grand Admiral Thrawn returned aboard the ''Chimaera'' and blocked their path. Since Thrawn's [[Noghri]] [[assassin]] [[Rukh]] and the Imperial forces had disabled the Dome's deflector shield generator, the ''Chimaera'' was able to bombard Capital City.<ref name="Family&Farewell" />

Ezra managed to stop the bombardment by offering to surrender himself. When Zeb proposed using the Dome's cannons to blast the ''Chimaera'', Rex advised against it since their weaponry was no match for the Star Destroyer's firepower. Despite Rex and Hera's objections, Ezra escaped on a patrol transport and went up to face Thrawn aboard the ''Chimaera''. In Ezra's absence, the rebels endorsed Sabine's plan to recapture the north and south power terminals in order to restart the Dome's shield generators.<ref name="Family&Farewell" />

Rex along with his fellow Team A members Hondo and Ketsu Onyo were assigned to the north power terminal. Despite fierce Imperial resistance, the rebels managed to reach the north power terminal after Ketsu used a manual override to extend the bridges. Sabine also aided Rex's team by sealing a blast door so that they could proceed with their mission to reactive the power terminal. When Hondo's Ugnaught companion Melch arrived with a stormtrooper hot in pursuit, Rex shot the trooper. Rex was distraught when his Clone comrade Gregor was shot in the chest while taking part in the assault to secure the south tower. After restarting the north power terminal, Rex attended to his fallen comrade. Gregor told him it was a pleasure fighting alongside him for a greater cause before dying in his arms.<ref name="Family&Farewell" />

After Ezra summoned a pod of purrgil to carry him, Thrawn, and the ''Chimaera'' into uncharted space, Rex and the other rebels watched in shock in the command center. The rebels then launched the Dome into Lothal's upper atmosphere. As stormtroopers tried to storm the command center, Rex and the other rebels evacuated aboard the ''Ghost'', which was being flow by Rex's fellow Clone trooper Wolffe, Mart Mattin, and Cikatro Vizago. Once safely airborne, the rebels detonated the Dome, wiping out the Imperial garrison on Lothal and ending Imperial rule on the planet.<ref name="Family&Farewell" />

General Syndulla then told Rex to bring out every [[Star map|star chart]] along Ezra's last known trajectory. However, they received a pre-recorded message by Ezra telling him that he made a difficult decision and thanking the Spectres for being his family. Rex warned that the Empire would return to the planet, an assessment shared by former ISB Agent Kallus who hoped that the Rebel Alliance would finally send support. He and his allies decided to help defend Lothal but in addition to that he continued to work with the Rebel Alliance with General Syndulla. Despite Rex's fears, the Empire never returned to Lothal.<ref name="Family&Farewell" />

====Battle of Endor====
{{Quote|Hera fought in the battle of Endor, as did Commander Rex.|Sabine Wren reflecting on the fall of the Empire|Family Reunion – and Farewell}}
Rex, who had since been promoted to the rank of commander, served at the [[Battle of Endor]].<ref name="Family&Farewell" />

===Legacy===
{{Quote|Next you're going to tell me that you weren't planning to mention Captain Rex, Ahsoka, Ventress, Cad Bane, Savage Opress, Jar Jar, and the Mandalorians?"<br>"Well.. I guess I could always go back and tell their stories later."<br>"Out of order?|A Whill, to another|Whills}}
Rex was remembered long after the [[Galactic Civil War]], and was mentioned by a [[Second Whill (From a Certain Point of View)|member]] of the [[Whills (community)|Whills]], as someone to be remembered in [[Timeline of galactic history|galactic history]]. The Whill mentioned Rex and the others when they learned that the [[Unidentified Whill|Whill]] tasked with writing about galactic history in the [[Journal of the Whills]] intended to start with the Galactic Civil War. The writer clarified Rex and the others stories would be told, but the other Whill protested that it was being done out of order.<ref name="Whills">{{Shortstory|story=Whills|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>

==Personality and traits==
[[File:Rex Clone Captain WotF.png|thumb|left|250px|Rex wearing his Phase II clone trooper armor during the Clone Wars.]]
Rex was a Clone Captain who was produced from the template of the bounty hunter Jango Fett.<ref name="The Clone Wars (film)" /> As with many of his fellow Clone troopers, Rex lived to serve the Galactic Republic<ref name="The Deserter" /> and to protect its citizens.<ref name="Trespass" /> While he was eager to follow orders, Rex adopted a less rigid approach as the Clone Wars wore on.<ref name="Darkness on Umbara" /> During the Clone Wars, Rex would work alongside the Clone Commander Cody,<ref name="Rookies" /> the Jedi Generals Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and the Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano.<ref name="The Clone Wars (film)" /> He was also loyal to his men and refused to believe that his comrade Echo had died or turned traitor.<ref name="A Distant Echo" />

Rex would develop a friendship with the Padawan Ahsoka Tano and became her mentor, offering her advice and valuable leadership experience. Rex taught her that experience outranked everything.<ref name="The Clone Wars (film)" /> When Tano was framed for murder and treason, Rex doubted that she had committed the crimes, but followed the order to arrest her. Despite this, the two would maintain a deep respect for each other after the Clone Wars and came to regard each other as friends. During the [[Imperial Era|Age of the Empire]], Rex would return a favor to his friend Tano by joining the rebellion. His knowledge of former Republic military bases,<ref name="Relics of the Old Republic" /> combat skills, and military tactics would help the rebellion in its fight against the Galactic Empire.<ref name="Stealth Strike" /><ref name="The Protector of Concord Dawn" /> He was deeply saddened when he learned about her presumed death on Malachor.<ref name="Twilight" />

While Rex initially had a difficult relationship with the Jedi Purge survivor Kanan Jarrus and argued over strategies and Ezra Bridger's priorities, the two put aside their differences following a mission to rescue Ezra and Commander Jun Sato from an Imperial Interdictor. Rex was staunchly loyal to the Old Republic and refused to recognize the authority of the Galactic Empire. Rex's fortitude led him to resist torture at the hands of the Imperial officer Brom Titus. He even regarded Imperial stormtrooper armor as inferior to the Clone trooper armor he wore during the Clone Wars.<ref name="Stealth Strike" />

[[File:RexPhase2Leap-SWE.png|right|thumb|220x220px|Rex in action during the Clone Wars.]]
Due to his Clone Wars experiences, Rex harbored a significant antipathy for [[battle droid]]s.<ref name="The Last Battle" /> However, he had a respectful relationship with the Lothal rebel's astromech droid [[C1-10P|Chopper]].<ref name="The Honorable Ones" /> His animus towards battle droids led him to reject Kalani's demand that Rex and his Jedi comrades Jarrus and Bridger take part in a reenactment of the Clone Wars. As a Clone trooper, Rex was bred to fight and wanted to finish his mission to destroy his battle droid opponents. However, Bridger managed to convince Rex and Kalani to put aside their past differences in order to fight against the Empire.<ref name="The Last Battle" />

Rex harbored considerable respect and loyalty to his former Clone Wars comrade Saw Gerrera, whom he had first met during the Onderon campaign. While Rex was unwilling to abandon his former comrade, he still expressed discomfort with some of Gerrera's harsh methods including brutalizing the Geonosian captive Klik-Klak and threatening to destroy the last Geonosian queen egg. Still, Rex was empathetic to Gerrera's pain and realized that his comrade was still grieving the loss of his sister Steela Gerrera. Rex's belief in the sanctity of life led him to fight with Saw, when the latter threatened to destroy the last Geonosian queen egg.<ref name="Ghosts" />

[[File:Captain Rex XWM.png|thumb|left|250px|Rex wielding his signature DC-17 hand blasters]]
Rex had a deep respect for Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi due to their shared experiences during the Clone Wars. However, despite personally wanting to believe Kenobi was alive, he believed Bail Organa's word that the Jedi Master had perished by [[2 BBY]]. Rex was proven wrong when Bridger encountered Kenobi during an errant mission to Tatooine.<ref name="Twin Suns" /> Rex and his friend Zeb were known for their sense of humor even during difficult times. During the Battle of Atollon, they traded jokes about joopa and quipped about Sabine's prototype shield generator.<ref name="Zero Hour" />

By the time that the Spectres returned to Lothal, Rex had become acquainted with his former Imperial foe Kallus. General Syndulla placed Rex in charge of looking after the ''Ghost'' in her absence.<ref name="The Occupation" /> Rex used his knowledge of Gregor and Wolffe's whereabouts to help Ezra find them, Ketsu, Hondo, and Melch in order to recruit them for Ezra's mission to liberate Lothal.<ref name="A Fool's Hope" /> Rex later used his military experience and combat skills to help the rebels capture the Dome during the Liberation of Lothal. As a warrior, Rex believed that the rebels needed to be on guard should the Empire return to Lothal.<ref name="Family&Farewell" />

==Skills and abilities==
{{Quote|I know someone who might be able to help us. A great military commander with a vast knowledge of the Outer Rim. He could assist us in finding a base, and his experienced leadership would make him a powerful ally.|Ahsoka Tano describes some of Rex's skills|The Lost Commanders}}
[[File:Rex DoR.png|thumb|right|230x230px|Rex favored his Phase II helmet, but donned his Phase I armor for durability.]]
Rex was a skilled military commander and a respected leader who won the respect of his men and peers.<ref name="The Lost Commanders" /> Due to his combat experience with battle droids, Rex was familiar with robolobotomy. While he was trained to wield firearms, Rex was also proficient in unarmed combat.<ref name="The Hidden Enemy" /> Besides fighting droids and Imperials, Rex also had some experience dealing with the spider-like krykna which lived near Chopper Base, the Phoenix rebel base on Atollon.<ref name="Mystery" /> Rex also knew how to handle machinery and could fly a Y-wing starfighter.<ref name="Steps" />

Rex put his combat and technical skills to good use during the successful rebel operation to infiltrate and launch the Dome during the Liberation of Lothal.<ref name="Family&Farewell" />

==Equipment==
During the Clone Wars, Rex wore both [[Phase I clone trooper armor|phase I]] and [[Phase II clone trooper armor|phase II]] clone trooper armor with blue markings, and was known for having Jaig Eyes on his helmet. Rex used dual [[DC-17 hand blaster|DC-17 blaster pistols]] in combat during the Clone Wars and continued to use them after the fall of the Republic. Rex somehow lost his helmet on Geonosis while looking for Saw.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:NikSant-ROTJ.png|thumb|left|207x207px|Nik Sant in ''Return of The Jedi''. ]]
Rex was created for the [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' film]] and [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|television series]], which ran from [[2008]] and [[2013]] on [[Cartoon Network]]. He was voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]], who reprised his role in the [[Star Wars Rebels Season Two|second]], [[Star Wars Rebels Season Three|third]] and [[Star Wars Rebels Season Four|fourth seasons]] of the [[Disney XD]] television series ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''. He has also appeared in several [[Star Wars Legends]] and non-[[canon]] media including the [[Dark Horse Comics]] ''[[Slaves of the Republic]]'' story arc and ''[[LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars]]''.

According to the ''The Clone Wars'' film DVD commentary, the series' creators originally intended to use the Legends clone trooper [[Alpha-17]] of the ''[[Star Wars: Republic]]'' [[comic book]] series as the series' prime clone character. However, ''[[Star Wars]]'' creator [[George Lucas]] objected to Alpha's inclusion as it would have made too much of an alliteration (Anakin, Artoo, Ahsoka and now Alpha), leading to the conception of Rex.<ref name="SW:TCW Film DVD Commentary">[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' film]] DVD commentary</ref>

Before the cancellation of ''The Clone Wars'' series, [[Brent Friedman]] wrote scripts for a four-episode arc starring Rex and R2-D2. A heated rivalry between the Clone Army's general ground forces and [[Clone trooper pilot|pilots]] and their droids would ultimately result in Rex flying a starfighter with R2 as his copilot. They would crash and be stranded together on one of the [[moon]]s of [[Ryloth]],<ref name="Untold Clone Wars Panel">{{SW|url=news/swca-the-untold-clone-wars-panel-liveblog|text=SWCA: The Untold ''Clone Wars'' Panel Liveblog}}</ref> where most of the episodes would take place.<ref name="Rex/R2 Ryloth Moon">{{Twitter|BFree63|status/588844674867068929|[[Brent Friedman]]|quote=@JacobRegan18 nope.

[[Dave Filoni]] speculated that Rex might be one of the members of the [[Pathfinders|Endor strike team]] from the [[1983]] film [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]. "I really do think that Rex is that guy on Endor", he said, "I really do. Why else is there a bearded old guy on [[Endor]], Tano? Why? It makes no sense. If you don't want that to happen, do you know what that means? I'm gonna make that happen, I'm getting like Palpatine, I'm getting power crazy".<ref name="Rex In RotJ?">{{Cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/captain-rex-in-return-of-the-jedi/|title=A 'Star Wars' Animated Character Might've Appeared in a Live-Action Star Wars Movie?|work=/Film|first=Peter|last=Sciretta|date=2016-03-30|accessdate=2016-04-01}}</ref> In Legends, the character was identified as [[Nik Sant/Legends|Nik Sant]].<ref name="TOSWFF44">''[[The Official Star Wars Fact File 44]]''</ref> The ''Rebels'' series finale, which aired on [[March 5]], [[2018]], confirmed that Rex did fight in the Battle of Endor, though it did not confirm whether he and Sant were the same character.<ref name="Family&Farewell" /> Six months after the episode's airing, Filoni revealed in an interview with [[Wikipedia:IGN|IGN]] he ultimately choose to not canonize the theory because he felt that laying down an already established character prior to his coming to ''Star Wars'' wasn't correct, adding that Rex could have been present at Endor and not be Sant, even though some fans could choose to believe that Rex and Sant are the same individual while other choose to not do so.<ref name="Rex=Sant?
