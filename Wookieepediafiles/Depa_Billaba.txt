{{Quote|You're lucky I'm not my Master. She'd never let you get away with&mdash;''"<br />"''All the things you tried to get away with?|Kanan Jarrus and Ezra Bridger|Path of the Jedi}}
'''Depa Billaba''', a [[Force-sensitive]] [[human]] [[Sexes|female]], was a [[Jedi Master]] who served on the [[Jedi High Council]] during the final [[Standard year|years]] of the [[Jedi Order]]. She was [[Reproduction|born]] on [[Chalacta]] and became a member of the Order at a young age, where she was [[Jedi training|trained]] by [[Jedi]] Master [[Mace Windu]]. Billaba was later appointed to the Council alongside her former teacher, and was present when Jedi Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] presented [[Anakin Skywalker]], the [[Chosen One]] to the governing body. She later attended [[Funeral of Qui-Gon Jinn|Jinn's funeral]] after the Jedi Master was killed during the [[Battle of Naboo]].

Billaba continued to serve as a member of the Council during the [[Separatist Crisis|political crisis]] that led to the [[Clone Wars]], a pan-[[The galaxy|galactic]] civil war between the [[Galactic Republic]] and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. During the war, she took [[Kanan Jarrus|Caleb Dume]] as her [[Padawan]] learner. After the [[Conquest of Kaller]], the two were attacked by Billaba's [[battalion]] of [[clone trooper]]s after the execution of [[Order 66]], a secret protocol branding all Jedi as enemies of the state. Due to Billaba's [[Death|sacrifice]], Dume survived the [[Jedi Purge]] and went into hiding under a new name&mdash;Kanan Jarrus. Initially traveling low and taking odd jobs, he eventually joined [[Spectres|a group of rebels]] who opposed the [[Galactic Empire]]. Although Jarrus hid his true identity as a Jedi for years, he remembered his Master with fondness. After adopting [[Ezra Bridger]] as an apprentice, Jarrus initially relied on his own incomplete training under Billlaba in order to teach Bridger the ways of the Jedi and [[the Force]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Depa Billaba was [[Reproduction|born]] on the [[planet]] [[Chalacta]] many [[Standard year|years]] prior to the [[Clone Wars]].<ref name="The Secret Jedi" /> [[Sexes|She]] had a sister, [[Sar Labooda]].<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars">''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''</ref> As a [[Youngling|child]], she was held as a captive by space [[pirate]]s who [[Death|killed]] her [[parent]]s.<ref name="SWCEUE" /> She was rescued by [[Mace Windu]], a member of the [[Jedi Order]], and he brought her into the Order. Billaba became Windu's [[Padawan]] and [[Jedi training|trained]] under the [[Jedi Master]] in the ways of [[the Force]] until becoming a [[Jedi Knight]]. She was renowned for her skills with a [[lightsaber]]<ref name="The Secret Jedi" /> and favored [[Form III]] when teaching other [[Jedi]].<ref name="Rise of the Old Masters">{{Rebels|Rise of the Old Masters}}</ref>

===Life as a Jedi===
====Invasion of Naboo====
[[File:High Council Chamber.png|thumb|left|252x252px|Billaba and the Jedi Council test Skywalker for possible Jedi training.]]
Eventually, Billaba was given a seat on the [[Jedi High Council]], serving alongside Windu. During the [[Invasion of Naboo]], she was present in the [[Jedi Council Chamber|Council chambers]] of the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]] when Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] told the story of how he [[Duel on Tatooine|encountered]] [[Maul|Darth Maul]] on [[Tatooine]], and how Jinn believed that Maul was a [[Sith Lord]]; Maul had been attempting to capture [[Queen]] [[Padmé Amidala]] of [[Naboo]]. The Jedi Master also revealed he had found [[Anakin Skywalker]], a young [[Slavery|slave]] he had freed on the [[desert]] planet, and that he believed the boy was the [[Chosen One]] destined to destroy the [[Sith]] and bring balance to the Force. The Council was skeptical of both claims, but nonetheless agreed to test the boy and investigate [[Darth]] Maul. Despite being impressed with Skywalker's abilities, the Council initially rejected Jinn's request that the boy be admitted into the Jedi Order on the basis that Skywalker was too old to begin Jedi training. They instead ordered that Jinn and his apprentice, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], travel to Naboo to protect [[Monarch of Naboo|Queen]] Amidala, who was returning to her planet to fight back against the [[Trade Federation]] invasion.<ref name="Episode I" />

The Federation's invasion and occupation ended during a [[Battle of Naboo|battle]] to retake the planet. Maul mortally wounded Jinn in [[lightsaber combat]], before Kenobi gravely wounded the Sith [[Lord]]; Maul went into [[Exile (punishment)|exile]] and would not be heard from again for many years. Jinn's dying wish was that Kenobi train Skywalker as a Jedi, a wish that the Council agreed to. Billaba and other members of the Jedi Council traveled to Naboo and attended [[Funeral of Qui-Gon Jinn|Jinn's funeral]], before taking part in a ceremony marking a newfound peace between the [[human]]s and [[Gungan]]s of Naboo; the Federation, as a common enemy, brought the once-feuding peoples together.<ref name="Episode I" />

===The Clone Wars===
{{Quote|My young strategist has been thinking again.|Billaba, to [[Kanan Jarrus|Caleb Dume]], after the training session with [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]|A New Dawn}}
Ten years later, the [[Separatist Crisis|Secessionist Movement]] plunged the [[Galactic Republic]] into a [[Politics|political]] crisis, with thousands of [[star system]]s seceding from the Republic and joining the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]]; the conflict was designed by [[Darth Sidious]], the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] publicly known as [[Supreme Chancellor]] Palpatine, as part of a plot to destroy the Jedi Order and take over [[the galaxy]]. Billaba was present on the Jedi Council when the body ordered Kenobi to investigate the [[Plot to assassinate Padmé Amidala|plot]] to [[assassin]]ate now-[[Senator]] Amidala, an outspoken opponent of the [[Military Creation Act]] that would have allowed the Republic to raise an [[Grand Army of the Republic|army]] to combat the Separatists; Skywalker was further ordered to travel with Amidala to Naboo so she could be protected from harm. These events led Kenobi to discover a [[Cloning|clone]] [[army]] built for the Republic in secret on [[Kamino]], and the [[Galactic Senate]] to grant Chancellor Palpatine emergency executive power. The Chancellor enlisted the clones as the Grand Army of the Republic, and they were put to use in the [[Battle of Geonosis]], which sparked the Clone Wars between the Republic and the Separatists&mdash;just as Sidious had intended.<ref name="Episode II">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]</ref> Her sister, Labooda, was killed during the battle.<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" />

====Attack on Mahranee====
Billaba was present on the Council whilst watching a live [[Hologram|holographic]] recording of the devastating Separatist [[Attack on Mahranee|attack]] on [[Mahranee]], the [[homeworld]] of the [[Mahran]] [[species]]. Following the attack, Windu convinced Billaba and the rest of the council on a secret mission to assassinate [[Count]] [[Dooku]]. At the suggestion of Kenobi, the Council recruited [[Quinlan Vos]], who was experienced in undercover work, and Dooku's former apprentice [[Asajj Ventress]] for this sensitive operation. Ventress agreed to assist Vos with the mission but insisted that the Jedi could only overcome Dooku by training in the ways of the [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]].<ref name="Dark Disciple">''[[Dark Disciple]]''</ref>

====Damaged goods====
[[File:Bacta Tank Billaba.jpg|thumb|285x285px|Billaba in a coma at the Jedi Temple's medical center.]]
At some point, [[Jedi General|General]] Billaba and her [[troop]]s [[Battle of Haruun Kal|faced]] [[General]] [[Grievous]], the [[Kaleesh]] [[cyborg]] who led the [[Separatist Droid Army|Droid Army]] of the Confederacy on [[Haruun Kal]].<ref name="Kanan 9">[[Kanan 9: First Blood, Part III: The Canyons of Kardoa|''Star Wars: Kanan 9: First Blood, Part III: The Canyons of Kardoa'']]</ref> That [[Standard day|day]], the Jedi Master's [[Depa Billaba's battalion|battalion]] suffered ninety percent casualties. Billaba herself was badly injured, to the point that she fell in a [[coma]]. After six [[Standard month|months]] of constant care at the [[Jedi temple]]'s [[Medical bay|infirmary]], she came out of her coma, seeming to have made a full physical recovery. The senior members of the Jedi High Council feared that her mental and emotional state might still be too damaged. Consequently, Billaba underwent a full fitness assessment. When it appeared that she had indeed fully recovered, Billaba was allowed to resume her position in the High Council.<ref name="Kanan 7" />

Following her reinstatement, Billaba took an interest in a [[Jedi youngling]] named [[Kanan Jarrus|Caleb Dume]], whose questioning nature caught her attention.<ref name="A New Dawn" /> She was impressed by Dume's questioning about how the Jedi Knights chose their Padawans when she and Windu were in the [[Jedi Archives]]. Billaba then instructed Dume, [[Sammo Quid]], and [[Tai Uzuma]] in Form III defensive poses.<ref name="Kanan 7" />

Billaba was present during a group training session in which Kenobi, now a Jedi Master and a member of the Jedi Council, told a group of younglings, including Dume, about a [[Jedi beacon|beacon]] in the [[Jedi Temple central security station|Jedi Temple's central security station]] that could call all Jedi back to [[Coruscant]] in [[time]]s of great crisis. Dume asked the Jedi Master if it could be used to warn Jedi away from Coruscant, a thought that Kenobi had never entertained and that caused concern and commotion amongst the assembled younglings. Billaba attempted to stop Dume from his line of questioning, but Kenobi encouraged him and speculated that the beacon could indeed be used to warn Jedi away in times of unexpected peril. Billaba saw Dume, as she had in the past, as having a mind for strategy and at the end of the session, Billaba was once again impressed by him.<ref name="A New Dawn" />

Despite her recovery and her reinstatement to the High Council, some of the [[clone trooper]]s started spreading the word that General Billaba was "damaged goods." This rumor reached Caleb Dume who decided to directly ask the Jedi Master. The two were discussing about whether she was "damaged goods" despite her recovery, but their discussion were interrupted when they sensed [[Kage Warriors|something]] and saw [[thermal detonator]]s outside her quarters.<ref name="Kanan 7" />

====Jedi Temple Bombing====
{{Quote|It seems I am in desperate need of a Padawan in order to continue my journey.|Depa Billaba to Caleb Dume|Kanan 8: First Blood, Part II: The Towers of the Temple}}
[[File:Billaba Dume Temple Roof Kanan8.png|left|thumb|266x266px|Billaba and Dume atop the Jedi Temple roof after stopping the Rackham Sear.]]
Billaba then took Dume and fled her quarters when the [[Bombing at the Jedi Temple|bombs]] went off. Billaba wanted to hide and wait for information, but went after Dume when he attempted to take on the bomber, CIS [[Captain]] [[Rackham Sear]]. Billaba saved Dume and prevented Sear from setting off his bombs.<ref name="Kanan 8">''[[Kanan 8: First Blood, Part II: The Towers of the Temple]]''</ref> When Sear refused her offer to surrender, they fought until he jumped off the roof and threw bombs at her and Dume. She survived and decided to take Dume as her Padawan.<ref name="Kanan 8" />

She trained him in the ways of the Force, as well as in lightsaber combat. Billaba valued Dume's strategic mind and encouraged him to put it to good use.<ref name="A New Dawn" /> At some point, Billaba brought Dume to one of the thousands of Jedi Temples in the galaxy in order to undergo a rite of passage in which he would need to face and overcome his greatest fears.<ref name="Path of the Jedi">{{Rebels|Path of the Jedi}}</ref> Three [[Standard week|weeks]] after the Jedi temple bombing, Billaba took Dume to get a [[Kyber crystal]]<ref name="Kanan 8" /> and construct [[Kanan's lightsaber|his lightsaber]].<ref name="Rebellion Begins">''[[The Rebellion Begins]]''</ref>

====Skirmish on Kardoa====
[[File:Billaba greets Haruun Kal survivors.png|right|thumb|262x262px|Billaba greets her old comrades-in-arms.]]
{{Quote|I'm ready for that briefing, Commander. Tell me about the men I'm now fortunate to command.|Depa Billaba|Kanan 9: First Blood, Part III: The Canyons of Kardoa}}
By the end of the war, Billaba and Dume went to [[Kardoa]] to take command of a [[Depa Billaba's new battalion|battalion]] led by survivors from her last [[battalion]], [[Clone Commander|Commander]] [[CC-10/994|Grey]], [[Clone Captain|Captain]] [[Styles]],<ref name="Kanan 8" /> [[Clone Sergeant|Sergeant]] [[Soot]] and [[Corporal]] [[Big-Mouth]].<ref name="Kanan 9" /> Their mission was to verify if there was a Separatist presence.<ref name="Kanan 9" /> Leading her battalion through some canyons, they were [[Skirmish on Kardoa|attacked]] by [[Coburn Sear]] and his [[droid]]s, whom Billaba managed to force a retreat, although Dume was injured.<ref name="Kanan 9" />

====Third Battle of Mygeeto====
{{Quote|You believe you know how to defeat me...<br>... But the Jedi you fought then did die...<br>... And the Jedi you face now is one you've never encountered before.|Billaba to Grievous|Kanan 11: First Blood, Part V: The Fog of War}}
[[File:Billaba vs Grievous Kanan11.png|left|thumb|310x310px|Billaba duels General Grievous on Mygeeto.]]
Billaba and her battalion were then [[Third Battle of Mygeeto|sent]] to [[Mygeeto]] to clear the southern [[mesa]]s of [[battle droid]]s. Billaba, Styles, Dume and [[CT-1157|Stance]] were outnumbered, but were able to clear the mesas. They became surrounded during another attack, and Billaba called Grey for an extraction. She and the others fought the droids as they came, but there were too many. They were then saved when [[Fenn Rau]]'s [[Skull Squadron]] bought them more time and were evacuated.<ref name="Kanan 10">''[[Kanan 10: First Blood, Part IV: The Mesas of Mygeeto]]''</ref> They never got to meet or thank Fenn Rau in person.<ref name="Protector of Concord Dawn">{{Rebels|The Protector of Concord Dawn}}</ref>

Billaba returned to the base camp. However the camp came under attack by battle droids led by [[Colonel]] Sear and General Grievous.<ref name="Kanan 10" /> Billaba fought Grievous, cutting off several of his hands. However, Grievous was able to wound her. Despite that, she continue fighting until Dume, Styles and Grey came to aid her. Grievous and his forces retreated. Billaba was placed in a bacta tank to heal from her wounds sustained in the fight.<ref name="Kanan 11">''[[Kanan 11: First Blood, Part V: The Fog of War]]''</ref>

====Battle of Kaller====
{{Quote|Captain Styles, have your men take the left flank.''"<br />"''Yes, General!''"<br />"''Commander Grey, the right.''"<br />"''Roger that.''"<br />"''Time to end this. All forces attack!|Jedi Master Depa Billaba leads her troops in the final rush of the battle|Kanan 1: The Last Padawan, Part I: Fight}}
[[File:Caleb Dume Depa Billaba training.png|thumb|right|259x259px|Billaba and her Padawan Caleb Dume, train on Kaller.]]
Billaba, alongside her apprentice Dume, Grey, and Styles [[Conquest of Kaller|fought]] against the [[Confederacy military|Separatist forces]] of General [[Kleeve]] on [[Kaller]]. Billaba and her [[Republic military|forces]] were able to route Kleeve's forces and forced his retreat. Billaba then spoke with [[Gamut Key]], assuring him that his village would no longer be forced into giving them supplies and labor. Billaba and her troops billeted outside of Key's village. After a training session with Dume that lasted after sunset, they relaxed at a campfire with Grey and Styles. They discussed the role of questions in regard to orders and to the Jedi Order, at which Billaba gave Dume a [[Kanan Jarrus' holocron|holocron]]. He was to use it to "study the role of questions" and "peaceful dissent" in the Order.<ref name="Kanan 1" />

====Order 66====
{{Quote|Caleb, we cannot win this battle&hellip; you ''must'' run. Go. I'll be right behind you.|Billaba's last words to Dume|Kanan 2: The Last Padawan, Part II: Flight}}
It was moments later after this that, at the culmination of his plan, Sidious executed [[Order 66]], a command to all clone troopers, including Grey,<ref name="Kanan 1" /> triggering their [[control chip]]s to kill the Jedi as traitors. It just so happened that Billaba had begun [[Meditation|meditating]] and received a [[Force vision]] of the deaths of her fellow Jedi, including Masters [[Ki-Adi-Mundi]], [[Aayla Secura]] and [[Plo Koon]]. Billaba took hold of Dume's arm which allowed him to see the visions, warning him also of the danger. By the time the clones started aiming, Billaba told Dume to run, already on her feet and igniting [[Depa Billaba's lightsaber|her lightsaber]].<ref name="Kanan 2" />

[[File:Depa lies to Caleb.png|left|thumb|230x230px|Lying that she would be following him, Billaba tells Dume to run.]]
While Dume froze up in shock, the clone troopers started firing: Billaba [[Form V|deflected]] their shots back at them, cut down the ones within reach and used blasts of [[Force push]] on groups. She shouted to Dume to bring him back to his senses and he quickly joined in her defense as they killed clone after clone. Grey ordered the others to surround them and Billaba quickly realized that they could not win against nearly an entire battalion that was going to cut off all escape routes. She told Dume to run and that she would be right behind him; Dume knew she was lying, but did as he was told.<ref name="Kanan 2" />

Grey ordered concentrated fire on Dume as he scrambled up a hill, but he deflected the ones that didn't miss, so Grey instead ordered Styles to cut him off and hunt him down. Billaba shouted to Styles and turned toward him, intending to use the Force on him, but this left her open to Grey who shot her in the back. Having fallen forward to the ground, Grey and two other clones repeatedly fired on her, much like what had happened to Secura.<ref name="Kanan 2" />

Having turned around at the top of the hill when he heard her shout to Styles, Dume witnessed his Master's death. Her sacrifice gave him time to hide and evade the clones, just as she'd hoped it would.<ref name="The Secret Jedi" /><ref name="Fire Across the Galaxy">{{Rebels|Fire Across the Galaxy}}</ref><ref name="Kanan 2" />

===Legacy===

Because of Billaba's sacrifice, Dume was able to escape the clone troopers. Sidious [[Proclamation of the New Order|declared]] himself [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] and transformed the Republic into the [[Galactic Empire]], with Jedi branded as enemies of the state. After watching a message from Master Kenobi&mdash;a message broadcast over the Jedi beacon, warning Jedi to stay away from Coruscant just as Dume had predicted&mdash;Dume went into hiding and changed his name to Kanan Jarrus. He kept his identity as a Jedi secret so as to avoid execution, and he gave up the Jedi path for many years. He had fond memories of Master Billaba, despite living as a civilian. He eventually joined [[Hera Syndulla]], a [[Twi'lek]] resistance fighter,<ref name="A New Dawn" /> and formed a [[Spectres|rebel cell]] that operated on and around the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] planet of [[Lothal]].<ref name="Spark of Rebellion">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion]]''</ref> He remained haunted by Billaba's final words, knowing that he ran away while she gave her life.<ref name="Fire Across the Galaxy" />

[[File:Master and Apprentice.png|thumb|right|255x255px|Jarrus became a rebel leader and took a Padawan of his own: Ezra Bridger.]]
During their rebellion on Lothal, Jarrus took on his own Padawan, [[Ezra Bridger]], who helped him reconnect with the Jedi path.<ref name="Spark of Rebellion" /> Some of Jarrus' own teachings were recollections of what Billaba had taught him, such as when Jarrus brought his student to a hidden [[Lothal Jedi Temple|Jedi Temple]] on Lothal in order to face and overcome his fears. Jarrus himself also had to face his own fear of being an inadequate [[teacher]], due to his training under Master Billaba having been incomplete by the time the Clone Wars ended.<ref name="Path of the Jedi" />

Her death left Jarrus with a bitter mistrust towards clone troopers, which Jarrus explained to Bridger after meeting Captain Rex and two other clone [[soldier]]s, telling him how she had been gunned down by the same men that had fought beside her for years.<ref name="The Lost Commanders">{{Rebels|The Lost Commanders}}</ref>

The records of the Jedi Temple, which included information about Billaba, also remained after the [[Jedi Purge|fall]] of the Jedi Order,<ref name="Rise of the Old Masters" /> and after the Temple was renovated into the Imperial Palace.<ref name="Tarkin">''[[Tarkin (novel)|Tarkin]]''</ref> [[The Grand Inquisitor]], a [[Dark Side Adept]] tasked with [[hunting]] down and eliminating Jedi who had survived the Clone Wars, was aware of Billaba from the Temple records. During a [[Duel on Stygeon Prime|confrontation]] with Jarrus, the [[Inquisitorius|Inquisitor]] correctly deduced that Jarrus had been trained by Master Billaba due to his preference towards Form III.<ref name="Rise of the Old Masters" />

Eventually in [[1 BBY]], Jarrus was [[Rescue of Hera Syndulla|killed]] when he saved his friends from a explosion caused by [[Governor]] [[Arihnda Pryce]]'s [[walker]], being engulfed by the flames after the Spectres escaped to safety.<ref name="Jedi Night">{{Rebels|Jedi Night}}</ref> Through his sacrifice the Specters and the other Lothal rebels were able to continue to fight on, and soon afterwards [[Liberation of Lothal|liberate]] Lothal from the Galactic Empire.<ref name="Family Reunion – and Farewell">{{Rebels|Family Reunion – and Farewell}}</ref>

[[File:DepaBillaba-WotG.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Depa Billaba was a powerful warrior.]]
Depa Billaba was a human female with [[Color|tan]] skin, and she wore jewels on her forehead and brow.<ref name="The Secret Jedi" /> She also bore the [[Chalactan]] marks of Illumination.<ref name="SWCEUE" /> She wore the simple, traditional garb of the Jedi Order, including a brown [[robe]] and a light tan [[tunic]].<ref name="Episode I" /> When she was a Padawan, she developed a close bond with her master, Mace Windu.<ref name="SWCEUE" /> She was considered a wise and spiritual Jedi,<ref name="The Secret Jedi" /> and she imparted what teachings she could onto Caleb Dume before she was killed during the fall of the Jedi Order. Jarrus survived the ensuing Jedi purge and eventually became a rebel leader, using the strategic mind that Billaba helped cultivate in order to [[Early rebellion against the Galactic Empire|fight against]] the Galactic Empire.<ref name="A New Dawn" /> Jarrus recalled Billaba as being a stricter teacher than he was, although she was not overly serious, sometimes gently teasing him about his habit of asking many questions.<ref name="Path of the Jedi" /><ref name="Kanan 1" /> He also remembered many of her teachings and passed them on to Ezra Bridger when he took the boy as his own Padawan.<ref name="Path of the Jedi" /> One such lesson was Billaba's belief that Jedi had to be willing to sacrifice themselves for the sake of others (which she herself carried out with her death), a lesson Jarrus himself did not fully understand until he allowed himself to be [[Raid on the communications tower|captured]] by the Empire on Lothal so the other rebels could escape.<ref name="Call to Action">{{Rebels|Call to Action}}</ref> She also believed that the Jedi Order made a crucial error in taking [[Military rank|military titles]], believing that was not a matter of leadership, but of role and rank.<ref name="Kanan 1" />

==Powers and abilities==
{{Quote|The Temple records are quite complete. In close quarter fighting, Billaba's emphasis was always on Form III, which you favor to a ridiculous degree.|The Inquisitor to Kanan Jarrus, during their first confrontation|Rise of the Old Masters}}
Billaba was skilled in the ways of lightsaber combat, which earned her renown from her fellow Jedi. Her skills were documented in the records of the Jedi Temple, which were accessed by the Empire after the fall of the Jedi Order. In studying the Temple records, the Inquisitor learned that Billaba emphasized the use of Form III in close-quarter lightsaber combat. He was able to use this information to deduce that Jarrus had been trained by the late Jedi Master.<ref name="Rise of the Old Masters" />

Although Billaba had studied to become a [[Consular Jedi]], she was a master of [[Form VII]] lightsaber combat.<ref name="Force Collection">{{ForceCollection|Depa Billaba|star=3}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Depa_Billaba_TCW.png|thumb|right|250px|Concept art of Billaba for ''The Clone Wars'' "Crystal Crisis on Utapau" arc.]]
Depa Billaba was based on an early design of a Jedi Council member for [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']] that had a spiritually inspired design.<ref>{{DB|character|depabillaba|Depa Billaba}}</ref> Billaba was portrayed by actress [[Dipika O'Neill Joti]] in the [[1999]] film.<ref name="IMDb Dipika O'Neill Joti">{{Imdb|name/nm0642086|Dipika O'Neill Joti}}</ref>

The character appeared again in the [[2002]] film [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']], but Joti did not film any new footage. Instead, stock footage from ''The Phantom Menace'' was used for her appearance as a Jedi Council member in ''Attack of the Clones''.<ref name="IMDb Trivia">[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121765/trivia?tab=cz&ref_=tt_trv_cc ''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'' Trivia on the Internet Movie Database (IMDb)]</ref> The character was slated to appear in the "Crystal Crisis on Utapau" arc in the animated television series ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'', which was revealed in concept art released on [[StarWars.com]] as part of [[The Clone Wars Legacy|''The Clone Wars'' Legacy]]. In these concept art, she was mislabeled as "Deepa Billaba." Ultimately the character did not appear in the episodes, which were released in story reel form on StarWars.com.<ref name="Crystal Crisis Concept Art">{{SW|url=tv-shows/crystal-crisis-on-utapau-concept-art-gallery|text="Crystal Crisis on Utapau" Concept Art Gallery}}</ref> Billaba holographically appeared in the [[2015]] novel ''[[Dark Disciple]]'', which was based off unproduced episodes of ''The Clone Wars'' for the seventh and eight seasons of the series.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

Despite effectively being a background character, with no lines in either ''The Phantom Menace'' or ''Attack of the Clones'', Billaba was the focus of a number of now-non-[[canon]] [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] stories.
