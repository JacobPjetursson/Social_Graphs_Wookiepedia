'''Pong Krell''', a [[Force-sensitive]] [[Besalisk]] [[Sexes|male]], was a [[Jedi Master]] during the [[Fall of the Republic|last years]] of the [[Galactic Republic]]. During the [[Clone Wars]], he held the [[Military rank|rank]] of [[Jedi General]] in the [[Grand Army of the Republic]]. Although the [[clone trooper]]s under his command sustained the highest casualty rates, Krell was recognized as a successful [[general]] due to his victories on the battlefield. In addition to his reputation as a general, he was also noted for his ferocity in personal [[Lightsaber combat|combat]]. The advantage of his four-[[Limb|armed]] physiology allowed him to use a unique form of [[Jar'Kai]]&mdash;wielding two [[double-bladed lightsaber]]s at the same [[time]]. However, as the war carried on, Krell began to see [[Force vision|visions]] of a [[New Order|new order]] rising to power in place of both the Republic and the [[Jedi Order]]. Driven by self-preservation, he secretly embraced the [[dark side of the Force]] and began undermining the [[Republic military]]'s war effort in hopes of gaining [[Count]] [[Dooku]]'s attention, to ultimately become his [[Sith apprentice|apprentice]] preceding the fall of the Republic.

During the [[Battle of Umbara]], Krell temporarily replaced [[Anakin Skywalker]] as the commanding [[officer]] of the [[501st Legion]]. When his [[soldier]]s discovered their general's secret allegiance to Dooku, the [[Cloning|clones]] mutinied against Krell's command and moved to arrest him for [[treason]]. Despite [[Death|killing]] multiple [[trooper]]s while attempting to escape, the fallen [[Jedi]] was [[Prisoner|captured]] and [[Prison|imprisoned]] by his men. Although his subordinate, [[Clone Captain]] [[Rex|CT-7567]], decided to execute him, it was ultimately Krell's strongest supporter, trooper "[[Dogma]]," on questioning Krell as to why he was performing these actions, who stole a blaster from [[CT-5555|Fives']] holster, and killed him for betraying the Republic.

==Biography==
A [[Besalisk]] [[Sexes|male]], Pong Krell ascended to the rank of [[Jedi Master|Master]] in the [[Jedi Order]] by the [[time]] of the [[Clone Wars]].<ref name="SWDKrell" />

===Clone Wars===
{{Quote|Time and rest are luxuries the Republic can't afford.|Pong Krell|Darkness on Umbara}}
As the [[Jedi]] were called into service by the [[Galactic Republic]], Krell joined the war as a [[Jedi General|General]] in the newly formed [[Grand Army of the Republic]]. Despite high [[Death|casualties]] of [[clone trooper]]s under his command, Krell achieved many victories.<ref name="SWDKrell" />

As the war progressed, Krell became seduced by the [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]] of [[the Force]]. He then received a [[Force vision|premonition]] about the future; the Jedi were all but [[Order 66|extinct]], the Republic fell, and a [[Galactic Empire|New Order]] [[Proclamation of the New Order|rose]] in its place. This caused Krell to betray both the Republic and Jedi Order. He acted as a double [[agent]] to sabotage the Republic's efforts. Krell sought to become the new [[Sith apprentice|apprentice]] of [[Sith Lord]] and [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist]] [[Head of State|leader]] [[Count]] [[Dooku]] and gain a position of power in the new order.<ref name="Carnage of Krell" />

====Battle of Umbara====
[[File:RexvsKrell-Umbara.png|left|thumb|220x220px|General Krell commanded the 501st Legion on Umbara with Rex as his 2nd-in-command.]]
In [[20 BBY]],<ref name="SWGA" /> Krell, along with Jedi [[General]]s [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], [[Saesee Tiin]], and [[Anakin Skywalker]] were sent by the [[Jedi High Council|Jedi Council]] to [[Battle of Umbara|retake]] [[Umbara]] back from its Confederate-aligned [[Umbaran]] [[Umbaran Militia|Militia]]. Krell then provided an air strike to Skywalker's forces. Krell then met up with Skywalker, and told that he was being recalled to [[Coruscant]] at the request of both [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] and the Jedi Council whilst Krell was given command of the [[501st Legion]].<ref name="DoU">{{TCW|Darkness on Umbara}}</ref>

==== Taking the airbase ====
{{Dialogue|Pong Krell|What is your plan?|CT-7567|I've dispatched two men on a stealth incursion into the airbase. They've been ordered to co-opt starfighters and use them against the tanks.|Krell|You what?! You put this entire assault on your hope that two clones can do what your entire group cannot?!|CT-7567|Sir, the rocket launchers don't work on these tanks. It would be easier to slip by undetected while the rest of us keep the tanks occupied.|Krell|Captain, you will launch a full forward strike immediately, or you will be relieved of duty.|attr=Pong Krell and CT-7567|src=The General}}
Krell then led the 501st to the outskirts of the [[Umbaran capital|capital]]. Krell, against [[Clone Captain|Captain]] [[Rex]]'s concerns, decided to attack the [[city]] by going along the main road instead of flanking the [[capital]]. However, Rex and his [[trooper]]s were forced to retreat away from the capital much to Krell's chagrin.<ref name="DoU" /> Krell and his forces then held their ground against the militia and their [[Zenuas 33 Umbaran starfighter]]s. Krell was then contacted by Kenobi, who told them that an [[Umbaran airbase|airbase]] was re-supplying the capital. Krell and the 501st were tasked to take the airbase.<ref name="TG">{{TCW|The General}}</ref>

[[File:501stFrontLines-Umbara.png|right|thumb|220px|Krell and his forces under heavy fire]]
As the 501st approached the outskirts of the airbase, Krell sent Rex and the battalion through a ravine to take the airfield. Despite Rex's and his troopers' objections, they went into the ravine. However, they came under heavy attack by the Militia's [[Impeding Assault Tank|impeding assault tanks]] and [[Umbaran mobile heavy cannon|mobile heavy cannons]]. Krell refused to let Rex and the [[battalion]] retreat or to send them reinforcements.<ref name="TG" /> After the [[Cloning|clones]] took the airbase, despite heavy casualties, Krell objected to allowing the clones use stolen enemy Umbaran [[Starship|ships]] to attack a [[DH-Omni Support Vessel|Separatist supply ship]]. Instead, he ordered the troopers to march directly into range of enemy [[missile]] [[fire]]. Rather than face certain death by following orders, several troopers secretly used the stolen ships anyway and successfully destroyed the supply ships, supporting Obi Wan Kenobi's attack on the Umbaran capital. Krell still had the [[soldier]]s who disobeyed orders locked in the brig. He later ordered Jesse and Fives executed.<ref name="Plan of Dissent">{{TCW|Plan of Dissent}}</ref>

====Krell's betrayal====
{{Quote|It's treason then.|Pong Krell, preparing to fight his own clone troopers|Carnage of Krell}}
[[File:KrellVsClones-CoK.png|thumb|left|220px|Pong Krell slays two clone troopers]]
The troopers refuse to go through with the execution. Krell told the clones that enemy soldiers had stolen Republic weapons and [[Clone trooper armor|armor]] and ordered them into battle. During the fight, the clones discovered that Krell had lied and had ordered the 212th and 501st, unbeknownst to both squadrons, to attack each other. Rex realized that Krell had intentionally orchestrated the deaths of countless clone troopers and organized the clones to arrest Krell. Krell initially escaped arrest, killing many clones in the process and fleeing into the Umbaran forest. Rex and his men pursued, and eventually caught up with him.<ref name="Carnage of Krell" />

[[File:Rexecutioner-CoK.png|right|thumb|220px|Krell, moments before his death]]
Many of the clones attacking Krell were slain by the fallen Jedi Master. However, Tup eventually tricked him into being captured by a [[vixus]], and then managed to [[stun]] and arrest Krell, putting him in a holding cell in the airbase. After Krell admitted to his treachery, and with the enemy advancing towards to the airbase, Rex decided to execute Krell before he could be freed by the approaching Umbarans. While waiting for Rex to shoot him, Krell expressed motivations to join the [[Sith]] and become Count Dooku's apprentice. He also played mind games with Rex, resulting in Rex's steady hand becoming shaky as Rex questioned his decision. However, [[Dogma]] seized a [[blaster]] and shot Krell dead before Rex could make a decision. Dogma insisted he had to shoot Krell because, "he betrayed us." Afterwards, Dogma himself was taken into Republic custody for killing an officer.<ref name="Carnage of Krell" />

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:PongKrellSafeLanding-CoK.png|left|250px|thumb|Despite his large size, Krell was very agile in combat]]
Pong Krell was a powerful Force-user. His [[Besalisk]] anatomy allowed him to wield [[Pong Krell's lightsabers|two]] [[Double-bladed lightsaber]]s at the same time.<ref name="SWEKrell">{{SWE|characters|generalpongkrell|General Pong Krell}}</ref> Krell's weapons were unique, as they could fold in the middle, making them easier to carry.<ref name="DOU" /> He wielded his lightsabers with deadly precision, spinning them like buzz saws to have devastating effect, and he was capable of killing many clone troopers with ease.  He was also highly skilled in unarmed combat as well.<ref name="Carnage of Krell" />

Krell was also skilled in the Force, as shown when he used all four arms to [[Telekinesis|repel]] the clone trying to arrest him.<ref name="Carnage of Krell" /> Krell was also skilled in [[Force jump]], as shown when he used it to dispatch two banshees,<ref name="DOU" /> and later used the ability to escape the tower of the Umbaran airbase.<ref name="Carnage of Krell" /> Pong Krell also had the ability to foresee future events.<ref name="Carnage of Krell" />
