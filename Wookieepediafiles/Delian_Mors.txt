{{Quote|Delian Mors is many things, Lord Vader, lazy, hedonistic, nihilistic, but she is not and never will be a traitor to the Empire.|[[Darth Sidious]] answering [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader's]] suspicions about Mors being a traitor|Lords of the Sith}}
'''Delian Mors''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|female]] who served as a [[Moff]] in the [[Galactic Empire]] in the [[Standard year|years]] after the end of the [[Clone Wars]]. In [[14 BBY]], Mors served as the Imperial Moff of the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] [[planet]] of [[Ryloth]]. Her underling [[Colonel]] [[Belkor Dray]] grew frustrated with her leadership and collaborated with the [[Free Ryloth movement]] in an attempt to discredit her. Mors was caught up in a [[Mission to Ryloth|plot]] by [[Cham Syndulla]] to assassinate [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] and [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]]. In an attempt to unseat her, Belkor collaborated with Cham. However, Mors and the two [[Sith Lord]]s outsmarted their opponents. Mors exacted revenge against Belkor and executed him.

==Biography==
===Moff of Ryloth===
In the early [[Standard day|days]] of the Empire's [[Imperial Era|rule]] over [[the galaxy]], Delian Mors' [[Marriage|wife]], [[Murra Mors|Murra]], was [[Death|killed]] in a [[transport]] accident. Around the same [[time]], she was assigned to the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] planet of [[Ryloth]], a post she considered undesirable. Her loss and her assignment felt like a burden, one that made her neglect some of her duties. A known [[spice]] addict, she lived a luxurious lifestyle on [[Ryloth's largest moon]] while assigning the day to day affairs of her position to her disgruntled underling [[Colonel]] [[Belkor Dray]]. Mors lived in a luxurious palace and was attended by [[Color|green]]-skinned [[Twi'lek]] servants, all [[Sexes|women]] and all scantily clad, who moved like pale-green ghosts through the rooms. Although none could leave, the Moff refused to call them [[Slavery|slaves]]. With Dray taken aback by Mors' negligent lifestyle and shady contacts, he took it upon himself to actively support a growing [[Free Ryloth movement|resistance movement]] on the [[planet]] in an attempt to tarnish Mors' reputation and place himself in command.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

===Calm before the storm===
In [[14 BBY]], Colonel Belkor visited [[Moff]] Mors at her luxurious palace on Ryloth's moon. The Moff was meeting with [[Nashi]] the [[Hutt]], an envoy of the Hutt [[crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]]. After Belkor arrived, Mors concluded her meeting with Nashi and allowed her to leave with three cases of [[Theenwine]]. When Nashi made a joke about Belkor in [[Huttese]], Mors translated that he was as straight and rigid as a tree. Mors described Belkor as a young ambitious officer. Following Nashi's departure, Mors turned her attention to Belkor and asked if he despised her for her dealings with the Hutts and decadence.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

Belkor denied this was the case and claimed that rank came with privilege, concealing his disdain for her. Belkor then proceeded to deliver Mors his quarterly report, which the Moff took little interest in. When Mors inquired about the Free Ryloth "terrorists", Belkor reported that he had dispatched his best assets to due with the case and that things on Ryloth had been quiet for a month. Mors then mentioned a recent [[Mission to hijack an Imperial weapons shipment|failed attempt]] by the Free Ryloth Movement to hijack an Imperial weapons shipment. When Mors inquired about Belkor's counter-insurgency efforts, he reported that the insurgents had blended in with the local population and that killing innocents indiscriminately would only increase sympathy for the Free Ryloth Movement.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

Mors then mentioned that [[Senator]] [[Orn Free Taa]] would be returning to Ryloth within ten days. She speculated that the [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] had ordered him back to publicize the failed terrorist hijacking and to offer support for the Imperial occupation. Belkor volunteered to handle the Senator's welcoming. Before leaving, she told Belkor to lighten up and to enjoy life and to fetch her wine girl. Unknown to Mors, Belkor planned to arrange for the Free Ryloth Movement to assassinate Orn Free Taa so that he could pin the blame on Mors. Both were unaware that the Emperor and [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] were accompanying Orn Free Taa as part of a plan to lure the Free Ryloth Movement out of hiding.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

===Attack on the ''Perilous''===
After Cham Syndulla's forces [[Mission to Ryloth|ambushed and attacked]] the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|Imperial Star Destroyer]] ''[[Perilous]]'', Belkor contacted Moff Mors via [[hologram]]. When Belkor reported the ambush, Mors chastised the Colonel for allowing a fleet of rebel ships to hold position at the edge of the [[Ryloth system]]. Belkor claimed his resources were limited and that they did not normally patrol that far out in the system. In truth, Belkor had diverted patrol craft and flight clearances in a way that had allowed Cham to move his ships into position. To ameliorate Mors, Belkor suggested calling for all available repair ships to give to the ''Perilous''. Mors obliged and allowed Belkor to manage the relief effforts<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

While Belkor went to dispatch repair ships, Mors conferred with another official and learned that the Emperor and Darth Vader were indeed aboard the ''Perilous''. Knowing the Emperor and Vader's fearsome reputations, Mors was afraid that

Despite her efforts, the ''Perilous'' was destroyed in orbit. Breehld informed Moff Mors of the news. This was a shocking development for Mors because this was the first time that an Imperial Star Destroyer had been destroyed. Mors feared that her career was in tatters as a result of the Star Destroyer's ambush. Mors then contacted Belkor who informed her that Lord Vader and the Emperor had escaped the ''Perilous''{{'s}} destruction. Since there were many survivors landing in [[escape pod]]s, Belkor directed Breehld to assist in rescuing the Emperor and Vader. When Mors demanded to know why [[Alpha-3 Nimbus-class V-wing starfighter|V-wing starfighters]] and rescue craft had not been diverted, Belkor claimed that he had delayed launching reinforcements to avoid colliding with the ''Perilous''{{'s}} wreckage.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

Mors reasserted her authority and chastised Belkor for not consulting him. She also warned that he would answer for his failures once she had returned to Ryloth. Mors instructed Breehld to get them around the planet as fast they could. Upon approaching the wreckage of the ''Perilous'', Mors discovered that the rescue ships had not arrived and that old [[Droid tri-fighter]]s were approaching the vicinity. Mors' shuttle also narrowly avoided colliding with an Imperial escort ship that had been stolen by a group of Twi'lek rebels led by [[Isval]], Cham's lieutenant. Breehld was killed during the collision while Mors suffered a gash on her head when she hit a chair. Unknown to Mors, Belkor had transmitted her ship ID to Cham's rebels as part of a plot to assassinate her.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

===Discovering a conspiracy===
Mors survived the crash-landing and woke up on Ryloth's rocky surface. After reflecting on the earlier events, Mors realized that Belkor was feeding information to the Free Ryloth rebels. After attending to the dead Breehld, Mors flew her damaged shuttle to the [[Equatorial Communications Hub]], which was commanded by her friend [[Major]] [[Steen Borkas]]. The Communications Hub had just been attacked by Isval's forces, who had damaged the station's communication dishes. After Mors established a visual connection, she was allowed to land at the Hub.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

Upon landing, Mors found that Borkas' crew were repairing the damaged communications dishes. Borkas recounted that the rebels had hijacked the communications system and tricked his crew into lowering their shields. When Borkas offered his resignation, Mors reassured him that he was not to blame and told him that she needed every trusted worker to get the situation under control. After seeing that Breehld's body had been removed from the shuttle, Mors met with Borkas to discuss the sequence of events surrounding the attack on the ''Perilous''. Borkas realized that the attack took a lot of coordination and asked if it was a coup attempt.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

After reflecting on the loss of Murra, Mors apologized for overlooking Borkas and promoting Belkor instead. Steen reassured her that he did not feel unfairly treated. Mors asked if she could rely on Borkas and he replied in the affirmative. Mors then disclosed her suspicions that Belkor was a traitor and that Vader and the Emperor had been aboard the stricken ''Perilous''. Borkas revealed that he had intercepted a transmission indicating that the rebels knew that Vader and the Emperor had escaped on a shuttle. While Mors led a search party to find the Sith Lords, she instructed Borkas to repair the communications net and to summon reinforcements. She emphasized that they were working against the clock to stop a coup attempt against her, the Emperor, and Vader.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

===Saving the Empire===
Mors and Borkas traveled in a shuttle and transport to search for the Emperor and Vader. The Imperials continued their search for the Sith Lords throughout the night. While conversing with the co-pilot, the two speculated that the survivors who had escaped the ''Perilous'' in ships and pods had been attacked by [[lylek]]s, predators native to Ryloth. As the search dragged on, Mors and Streen's transports encountered a V-wing starfighter that was piloted by one of Belkor's men. Since Belkor had misled his men into believing that Mors was plotting to kill the Emperor and Vader, the starfighter had approached them with weapons locked.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

Mors managed to establish contact with the pilot over the com and convinced him that Belkor was the true traitor. She told the pilot that she and Borkas were searching for Vader and the Emperor. The pilot introduced himself as [[Wing Leader]] [[Arim Meensa]] and agreed to warn his fellow V-wing pilots of Belkor's treachery. After questioning Meensa, Mors learned that Belkor had told the pilots that they would end up having to attack a ground target based on coordinates. She also learned that Belkor had abruptly changed the search area a short time earlier, which meant he was close to finding the Emperor and Lord Vader.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

Mors instructed Meensa and his men to warn her and Borkas once Belkor had discovered the Emperor and Vader's location. They were to ignore Belkor's orders to bomb the target and instead to give her his coordinates and delay their arrival. Mors planned to land stormtroopers at the village. Belkor eventually discovered that the Sith Lords had taken refuge in a [[Drua's village|local village]]. By that stage, Cham and his forces had converged on the village for an assault. A panicking Belkor contacted Cham and warned that the Imperials had restored their communications and that their plan was unraveling. Despite this setback, Cham insisted on proceeding with his planned attack.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

Mors's shuttle and transport accompanied Meensa's V-wings on their fly-over the village. Belkor tried to contact Meensa but received no response. Desperate, he hailed the shuttle only to her Mors' over the com. Mors chastised Belkor for trying to kill her and hundreds of their comrades. Belkor tried to feign innocence but Mors chastised him for being dishonorable. When Belkor criticized her for her hedonistic lifestyle and corruption, Mors pointed out that unlike her he had blood on his hands. As a result, she concluded that he would have to pay a heavier price than her for his transgressions.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

When Belkor asked if she was going to turn him over to the [[Imperial Security Bureau]] or Vader, Mors ordered her V-wings to assume firing position. After fare-welling her former enemy, Mors' V-wings destroyed Belkor's recon craft. Mors then led the assault on the Twi'lek village. She and Steen landed their ships on either side of the Twi'lek forces in the quarry. This allowed the Imperial [[stormtrooper]]s to trap Cham's attack force. Mors remained aboard the ship for the duration of the assault and watched Vader slaying rebel soldiers with his [[lightsaber]]. The Emperor and Lord Vader survived the coup attempt due to Mors' diligence. While many of the Twi'lek rebels were killed, Cham, however, managed to escape to fight another day.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

===Searching for smugglers===
One year later, Mors, who had been warned by the Emperor that she had one chance left to prove herself, was alerted to a malfunction in the automated traffic control bringing ships to [[Lessu]]. A ship, the ''[[Eclipse (freighter)|Tirion]]'', had gone missing during the brief outage. She dispatched fighters to search for the freighter, which, unbeknownst to the Moff, was actually a smuggling ship called the ''Eclipse'' that had been hired by the Free Ryloth Movement to bring in a shipment of medicine for an outbreak of disease on Ryloth. The fighters were able to track the freighter to Lessu, but after landing briefly on the city's shell to deliver its cargo, the ''Eclipse'' was able to evade its Imperial pursuers and escape back into [[hyperspace]]. Hearing of the escape, Mors was terrified, believing that she had blown her one chance.<ref name="Mercy Mission">{{Shortstory|story=Mercy Mission (short story)|sformatted=Mercy Mission|book=The Rise of the Empire}}</ref>

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Son, there will be an investigation like we've never seen, the Imperial Security Bureau, stormtrooper garrisons, all of it. Listen, I don't know all of what Belkor told you, but you should believe none of it. And unless you're also a traitor, power down your weapons now, and communicate with no one other than us. Acknowledge.|Delian Mors was loyal to the Empire and showed leadership and resolve when push came to shove|Lords of the Sith}}
Delian Mors was a middle-aged [[human]] woman. Mors could understand Huttese due to her frequent contacts with Hutts. She was in a same-sex marriage with Murra. After Murra was killed in an untimely airspeeder accident, Mors sank into depression and lost her sense of purpose. She became a consumer of spice, which caused her to have watery eyes and a vague expression during her spice hazes. As a Moff of Ryloth, Mors was known for her hedonistic lifestyle and lackadaisical attitude towards her work. She delegated most of the governing of Ryloth to Colonel Belkor Dray, who came to despise her.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

Belkor's ambitions led him to become a spy for Cham Syndulla, the leader of the Free Ryloth movement. He attempted to exploit the Emperor and Darth Vader's visit to Ryloth as a means to discredit her leadership and boost his own political career. During the crisis, Mors rose up to the challenge. With the help of Major Steen Borkas, Mors coordinated the successful recovery efforts to find the Emperor and Lord Vader. She managed to appeal to her subordinates' loyalty to the Empire and succeeded in winning over Belkor's men. Mors took the deaths of hundreds of Imperial personnel personally and executed Belkor for his [[treason]].<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

Mors was also a competent military commander and led a successful counter-attack which trapped Cham Syndulla's forces.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />
