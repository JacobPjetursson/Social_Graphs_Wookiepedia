{{Quote|History...Is an interesting thing. We know only...the versions we are told. It does not mean...that there are not...other truths.|Bobbajo|All Creatures Great and Small}}
'''Bobbajo''' was a [[Sexes|male]] [[Nu-Cosian]]<ref name="ACGS" /> with a [[Color|white]] beard who lived on [[Jakku]] approximately thirty [[Standard year|years]] after the [[Battle of Endor]].<ref name="Set to Roll">{{SW|url=news/star-wars-episode-vii-set-to-roll-cameras-may-2014.html|text=Star Wars: Episode VII Set to Roll Cameras May 2014}}</ref> He carried a group of animals around in cages, including frog-like [[gwerp]]s, chicken-like [[pishne]]s, a [[lonlan]], two [[zhhee]] and an ill-tempered [[worrt]] named [[J'Rrosch]].<ref name="ACGS" /><ref name="YouTube" /> His calm demeanor helped settle down the animals while he transported them.<ref name="VD" /> He roamed between the settlements of the planet telling stories to local villagers and entertaining children with the talents of his menagerie. He claims his creatures were responsible for the destruction of the first Death Star, but few believe him. This earned him the names of the "'''Storyteller'''" and the "'''Crittermonger'''".

The video was filmed on the set of [[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']] and showed the creature walking behind Abrams while he talked, at one stage drawing the director's attention. He was one of the first new characters from Episode VII to have been shown. He was portrayed by [[Aidan Cook]] in the film
