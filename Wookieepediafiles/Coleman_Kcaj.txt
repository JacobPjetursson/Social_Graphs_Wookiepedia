====Mission to the moon of Obah Diah====
Kcaj was present when [[Plo Koon]] reported that he found the [[Sifo-Dyas' lightsaber (Oba Diah)|lightsaber]] of Master [[Sifo-Dyas]]. [[Yoda]] confirmed that it was and decided to investigate. Kcaj was again present when it was reported that [[Dooku]] was responsible for the purchase of the [[Grand Army of the Republic|clone army]].

Kcaj was present when Yoda told the Council that he had heard the [[Force spirit|voice]] of long-dead Jedi Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] in his head and hoped to learn the meaning of the communications from beyond.

He was also present when they discussed about how Palpatine had told them that [[General]] [[Grievous]] was hiding on Utapau and recommended they send Skywalker. However, they decided that they needed a Jedi Master, who would have more experience. Shortly thereafter, Palpatine [[Proclamation of the New Order|declared]] himself [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] and Skywalker, having become the [[Sith Lord]] [[Darth]] Vader, helped [[Jedi Purge|destroy]] the Jedi Order.<ref name="ROTS" />
