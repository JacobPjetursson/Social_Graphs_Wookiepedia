'''Thanoth''' was a [[Sexes|male]] [[human]] who served the [[Galactic Empire]] as an extremely skilled [[inspector]]. He was assigned to the [[Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] as an [[adjutant]] in order to help [[Detective|investigate]] a large sum of [[credit]]s confiscated from the [[Son-tuul Pride]] being [[Son-tuul Pride robbery|stolen]] from the [[Arquitens-class light cruiser|''Arquitens''-class light cruiser]].

==Biography==
===Inspector===
{{Quote|Larceny is the least of the great crimes. Mark my words, we'll have tidied this away within the day.|Thanoth assures Vader the case will be quickly resolved|Darth Vader 8: Shadows and Secrets, Part II}}
The [[Sexes|male]] [[human]] Thanoth held the rank of [[inspector]] and worked for the [[Galactic Empire]]'s [[Inspectorate]] during the [[Galactic Civil War]] against the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. Shortly after the [[Battle of Yavin]], he was assigned by [[Grand General]] [[Cassio Tagge]] to replace [[Oon-ai]] as an [[adjutant]] for the [[Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] while Vader investigated the [[Son-tuul Pride robbery|theft]] of a large sum of [[credit]]s from an Imperial [[Arquitens-class light cruiser|''Arquitens''-class light cruiser]]. When first introduced to Vader on Tagge's [[Super Star Destroyer]] ''[[Liberty's Misrule|Annihilator]]'', the Inspector noted dust on Vader's [[Vader's armor|armor]] which placed him on the [[moon]] [[Anthan 13]] within the last 24 [[Standard hour|hours]], an [[orbit]]al body located in the same [[star system]] that the theft had taken place, leading the inspector to correctly assume that Vader had been behind the incident.<ref name="V8" />

===Working with Vader===
{{Quote|It's been a pleasure working with you, Anakin.|Thanoth, before his execution|Darth Vader 20: End of Games, Part I}}
Eventually, Thanoth, a dedicated patriot of the Empire, uncovered Vader's true identity as Anakin Skywalker, and figured out Vader's plan to replace [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]]. The inspector met and told Vader where he could find the wayward [[Doctor]] [[Chelli Lona Aphra|Aphra]] on [[Cosmatanic Steppes]]. Thanoth was subsequently [[Death|killed]] instantly by the [[Sith]] [[Lord]]'s [[Darth Vader's lightsaber|lightsaber]] to keep his secret, although Thanoth believed it was for the best of the Empire that Vader succeeded.<ref name="V20" /> Thanoth considered the destruction of the Death Star to be a sign of the Emperor's growing weakness, and believed the Empire would be better off if Vader overthrew Palpatine with the aid of his son, Luke Skywalker.{{Fact}}
