{{Quote|His fight against the droids has made him a symbol of freedom for the people.|Mace Windu, about Cham Syndulla|Liberty on Ryloth}}
'''Cham Syndulla''' was a [[Twi'lek]] [[Sexes|male]] who dedicated his life to being a resistance fighter and revolutionary leader during the [[Clone Wars]] and the early days of the rebellion against the [[Galactic Empire]]. Syndulla started as a political revolutionary who opposed the corruption of Ryloth's [[senator]], [[Orn Free Taa]], but the [[Battle of Ryloth|invasion]] of Ryloth by the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] during the Clone Wars saw him turn his attention towards rebellion. He formed the [[Twi'lek Resistance]] and fought alongside [[Jedi Master]] [[Ima-Gun Di]] and the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] in their initial attempts to repel the Separatist [[warlord]] [[Wat Tambor]] and the [[Separatist Droid Army]], but the Republic's initial assistance was limited and the Twi'leks were vastly outnumbered. Though Syndulla was reluctant to trust the Republic again and feared a Republic military occupation of Ryloth, Syndulla ultimately allied himself with [[Jedi General]] [[Mace Windu]] and, together, they liberated Ryloth from the Separatists.

His concerns over the Republic were eventually confirmed when, at the end of the Clone Wars, [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] declared himself [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] and [[Proclamation of the New Order|transformed]] the Republic into the Galactic Empire. Ryloth fell under [[Imperial Military]] occupation, so Syndulla formed the [[Free Ryloth movement]] to fight back. He and the movement hoped to strike a crippling blow to the Empire by attempting to [[Death|assassinate]] the Emperor and his [[Sith apprentice|apprentice]], [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], when they visited Ryloth, but the plot failed. In reality, it was a trick by the Emperor to lure the Free Ryloth movement into a trap. Many of the movement's members were killed, but Syndulla managed to escape.

Syndulla's [[Hera Syndulla's mother|wife]] was killed at some point during the Twi'lek rebellion and also had a [[Hera Syndulla's brother|son]] who died young, so Syndulla fully dedicated himself to his cause and cared only about liberating Ryloth. This created strain in Syndulla's relationship with his daughter, [[Hera Syndulla|Hera]], who left Ryloth to fight the Empire on other worlds. In the third [[Standard year|year]] before the [[Battle of Yavin]], Syndulla partnered with Hera and her rebel forces in order to capture an [[Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier|Imperial carrier]] over Ryloth for the rebel fleet. The elder Syndulla briefly betrayed the rebels in an attempt to destroy the carrier, hoping to use its destruction as a symbol to rally the people of Ryloth to the cause of his resistance, but he ultimately helped the rebels capture the carrier. In the process, an [[Arquitens-class command cruiser|''Arquitens''-class command cruiser]] was destroyed, giving Syndulla the symbol he hoped for. The events led him to reconcile with Hera and see the virtues of fighting the Empire beyond just Ryloth. By the time of the outbreak of the [[Galactic Civil War]], Cham had become a grandfather to [[Jacen Syndulla]] a male [[human]]-Twi'lek who was both Hera's and [[Jedi Knight]] [[Kanan Jarrus]]' son.

==Biography==
===Political revolutionary===
{{Quote|Cham Syndulla was a radical before the war. He is very unpredictable.''"<br />"''He can't be trusted. I know Syndulla seeks to gain power. We were political rivals.|[[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] and Orn Free Taa|audio=ChamSyndullaUnpredictable-LoR.ogg|Liberty on Ryloth}}
Cham Syndulla hailed from the [[planet]] [[Ryloth]],<ref name="Databank" /> [[homeworld]] of the [[Twi'lek]]s.<ref name="Liberty on Ryloth" /> Syndulla became a political revolutionary and opposed what he saw as the corruption in the [[Galactic Republic]]. For Syndulla, the corruption had no greater face than that of [[Orn Free Taa]], the [[senator]] of Ryloth.<ref name="Databank" /> The distrust that Syndulla felt towards the senator was mutual; Taa considered Syndulla to be a political radical, one who was unpredictable and sought to gain power for himself. In actuality, Syndulla's goal was the freedom of his people,<ref name="Liberty on Ryloth" /> which he fought for throughout his life. Syndulla had a daughter, [[Hera Syndulla|Hera]], who was inspired by his leadership amongst their people.<ref name="Homecoming">{{Rebels|Homecoming}}</ref>

===The Clone Wars===
====Fall of Ryloth====
{{Quote|I promise you, Cham, the Republic will not abandon Ryloth.''"<br />"''I've heard enough of your promises, Jedi. The fact remains, if we stay here without reinforcements, we're all going to die.|Generals Ima-Gun Di and Cham Syndulla|Supply Lines}}
[[File:Ima-Gun Di and Cham Syndulla.png|thumb|300px|left|Syndulla and Jedi General Ima-Gun Di led the initial Republic and Twi'lek efforts against the Separatists.]]
During the [[Clone Wars]], twenty-two [[Standard year|years]] before the [[Battle of Yavin]], [[Emir]] [[Wat Tambor]] of the [[Techno Union]] led the [[Separatist Droid Army]] in an [[Battle of Ryloth|invasion]] of Ryloth. As Hera and [[Hera Syndulla's mother|her mother]] fled underground,<ref name="Wings of the Master">{{Rebels|Wings of the Master}}</ref> Syndulla turned his political revolution into an armed resistance movement and formed the [[Twi'lek Resistance]] to combat the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist Alliance]] and liberate his world. Syndulla and his freedom fighters were the first to battle the Separatist forces on Ryloth.<ref name="Liberty on Ryloth" /> They were soon aided by a [[Garrison/Legends|garrison]] from the [[Grand Army of the Republic]], under the command of [[Jedi General]] [[Ima-Gun Di]] and [[Clone Captain]] [[Keeli]]. With their help, Syndulla mounted a defense of a Twi'lek [[refugee]] encampment, where the resistance fighters' families dwelled, against an army of [[battle droid]]s.<ref name="Supply Lines">{{TCW|Supply Lines}}</ref>

Along with his friend and fellow [[soldier]] [[Gobi Glie]], Syndulla commanded the resistance against the approaching battle droids. The situation turned dire as the resistance forces began running low on [[Foodstuff|food]], [[water]], and ammunition as a result of the Separatist blockade of Ryloth. General Di attempted to find more supplies by sending a message to the [[Jedi High Council]] through the orbiting Republic fleet, but the fleet was destroyed and the Republic supply lines were completely cut off. Without the Republic's re-supply efforts, the Republic and resistance forces lost more ground to the droid army and became trapped in the cliffs where the refugee village had been established.<ref name="Supply Lines" />

The dire situation tested Syndulla's faith in the Grand Army of the Republic, and it seemed that the survival of the resistance was a lost cause. General Syndulla felt betrayed by the turn of events; he and his people were promised Republic assistance, and the Republic did not deliver. Di, however, came up with a plan to save the refugees and the resistance fighters. To do so, they would use their remaining [[Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry|gunship]] as a bomb that would collapse an adjacent pass, cutting the Separatists off from the resistance fighters and their families. Once the pass collapsed, Di and Keeli would cover the Twi'lek retreat.<ref name="Supply Lines" />

[[File:SyndullaKeeliDi.png|thumb|300px|right|Syndulla leads his people into retreat.]]
Once the plan was in motion, Syndulla and Glie prepared their forces and their families to leave, while the Republic began their distraction. Syndulla successfully led his people to safety, but Di and Keeli were [[Death|killed]] while providing cover for the resistance. Their sacrifice, however, was not a lost cause; the Twi'lek Resistance lived to fight another day, and the Republic&mdash;with the help of Senator [[Bail Organa]] of [[Alderaan]] and the [[King]] [[Katuunko]] of [[Toydaria]]&mdash;sent re-supply ships through the Separatist blockade. With the Republic able to slip through, the resistance fighters and their people acquired the food and medical supplies they so desperately needed.<ref name="Supply Lines" />

====Liberating Ryloth====
{{Quote|I was wondering when you'd find me, Master Jedi.''"<br />"''General Syndulla, I've come for your help.''"<br />"''What makes you think you'll get it?|Cham Syndulla meets Mace Windu|audio=I'veComeForYourHelp-LoR.ogg|Liberty on Ryloth}}
After escaping, the resistance forces continued to engage the Separatist Droid Army in the hopes of liberating Ryloth, though Syndulla no longer had any desire to see assistance from the Republic that had failed to help them before. The Separatists pursued Syndulla's forces and slaughtered many Twi'leks, littering the plains of Ryloth with the bodies of Twi'leks who stood against them. The freedom fighters set up refugee camps underground, which they maintained while engaging droid patrols. <ref name="Liberty on Ryloth" />

[[File:Mace meets Cham.jpg|thumb|300px|left|General Syndulla meets Jedi Master Mace Windu.]]
Despite their initial losses, the Republic mounted a major offensive to retake Ryloth from Wat Tambor and the Separatists, scoring a number of victories against the Droid Army.<ref name="Storm Over Ryloth">{{TCW|Storm Over Ryloth}}</ref><ref name="Innocents of Ryloth">{{TCW|Innocents of Ryloth}}</ref> Jedi General [[Mace Windu]] traveled to Ryloth with the intention of taking the [[capital]] of [[Lessu]] from the droids, and the Republic suffered losses in a failed attempt to retake the capital. Windu sought out Syndulla in the plains, where the general surrounded the Jedi as Windu explained he and his forces, including [[Advanced Recon Force trooper|ARF troopers]] [[Stak]] and [[CT-6910|Razor]], had come to enlist Syndulla's help in liberating Ryloth. Syndulla brought the Jedi into his camp, where he found that Glie had been injured and urged him to tend to his wounds so he could return to the fight. After seeing to his friend, Syndulla offered Windu food and drink. Supplies were short, but Syndulla honored the traditions of Twi’lek hospitality. <ref name="Liberty on Ryloth" />

Syndulla was reluctant to trust Windu for a number of reasons. Not only had the Republic already abandoned Ryloth once, but Syndulla also feared what would happen after the liberation of Ryloth&mdash;to the freedom fighter, a Republic military presence on Ryloth, supported by Senator Taa, was simply another armed occupation, and Ryloth could not truly be free under such conditions. Once Syndulla learned that the Separatists had begun bombing Twi'lek villages, however, Syndulla agreed to speak with the senator. Though the conversation between the two was tense and full of bickering, Windu focused them on the matter at hand. As they spoke, Jedi General [[Anakin Skywalker]] reported that his clone forces engaged the Separatists that were bombing the Twi’lek villages. Syndulla and Taa came to realize that Tambor knew his defeat was imminent and was choosing to destroy whatever he could not have. To put aside their differences, Taa promised that the Grand Army of the Republic would not occupy Ryloth, while Syndulla agreed that he would not seek political power. With those promises, Syndulla was officially allied with the Republic and rallied his freedom fighters to finish the fight with the Separatists.<ref name="Liberty on Ryloth" />

Finding a way into the capital city proved to be a particular challenge, as the only entry point was a [[Plasma|plasma bridge]] that was controlled from within the city itself. Making matters worse was that Tambor moved the city's population to sit on the outside of the city, which prevented the Republic from launching a direct attack lest there be civilian causalities. The allied forces soon discovered a way in, however, when the resistance discovered Separatist [[Multi-Troop Transport]]s that were traveling along a cliff overlooking the city. Syndulla informed Windu about the transports and how they were carrying treasures for Emir Tamor. Windu, Stak, and Razor infiltrated one of the transports and made it across the bridge, while Syndulla and his forces engaged the Separatists to give Windu time to activate the plasma bridge.<ref name="Liberty on Ryloth" />

[[File:Syndulla charge.png|thumb|300px|right|Syndulla leads the charge into Lessu, where the Twi'lek Resistance and the Republic successfully seize the capital.]]
Once the bridge was activated, Syndulla led the charge into Lessu, where the resistance fought against the Droid Army. Windu, meanwhile, captured Emir Tambor. When he was captured, the leader of the Separatists, the [[Sith Lord]] [[Count]] [[Dooku]], ordered Separatist bombers to destroy the city. The city was saved, however, by the arrival of General Skywalker and his [[Padawan]], [[Commander]] [[Ahsoka Tano]], flying [[Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor|Jedi starfighters]]. With the capital secure, Tambor formally surrendered to Syndulla, and the resistance leader thanked General Windu for his assistance. He later joined Windu, along with Senator Taa, to watch a parade that celebrated the liberation of Ryloth.<ref name="Liberty on Ryloth" /> The liberation of Ryloth and Syndulla's leadership over the resistance was remembered in songs which celebrated the Battle of Lessu.<ref name="Homecoming" />

===Age of the Empire===
====Balancing family and Ryloth====
{{Quote|Not a terrorist, but a freedom fighter. Not a terrorist, but a freedom fighter.|Cham Syndulla, to himself|Lords of the Sith}}
The liberation of Ryloth was short-lived. At the end of the Clone Wars, [[Supreme Chancellor|Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]]&mdash;who in actuality was [[Darth]] Sidious, the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]]&mdash;[[Proclamation of the New Order|transformed]] the Republic into the [[Galactic Empire]]. Ryloth fell under [[Imperial Military]] occupation and had its resources plundered, so Syndulla organized and led the [[Free Ryloth movement]] in order to liberate his homeworld.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" /> Though his fears about the Republic were proven true, Syndulla nonetheless held the Jedi in high regard. He told Hera stories about how the Jedi fought in the Clone Wars,<ref name="A New Dawn">''[[A New Dawn]]''</ref> and he remained fond of [[Jedi Master]] Windu,<ref name="Homecoming" /> who was killed during the [[Order 66|fall]] of the [[Jedi Order]] at the end of the war.<ref name="Episode III">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref>

[[File:Sidious and Vader on Ryloth.png|thumb|300px|left|Sidious and Vader fight Syndulla's Free Ryloth movement, which attempted to assassinate them.]]
At some point during the resistance against the Empire, Hera's mother was killed. Her death left Syndulla totally devoted to the cause of his rebellion, and he prioritized the liberation of Ryloth as his most important duty. This strained his relationship with Hera, who believed all her father cared about was his mission. Unlike her father, who only believed in fighting for the liberation of the Twi'leks, Hera hoped to see the whole galaxy freed from the Empire. She left Ryloth and set out to organize her own rebel movement, one that would ultimately become part of a larger rebellion against the Empire. Despite the strain in their relationship, Syndulla was heartbroken that his daughter left Ryloth. The two would not speak for several years, though Syndulla did hear stories about Hera’s rebel [[Spectres|crew]], including the Jedi [[Kanan Jarrus]].<ref name="Homecoming" /> She also considered her father to be her greatest inspiration;<ref name="Epic Battles">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Visual Guide: Epic Battles]]''</ref> though it was her mother that the elder Syndulla believed to have taught her how to be a dreamer, Hera said it was her father who taught her how to be a leader.<ref name="Homecoming" />

During the time of the Empire, Syndulla had become known as "the liberator of Ryloth." His tactics in defeating the Separatists were taught at the [[Imperial Academy of Mandalore|Imperial Academy]] on [[Mandalore]], and Syndulla took pride in the fact that the Empire had still not figured out how to beat him.<ref name="Homecoming" /> Syndulla also claimed responsibility for an explosion at a reservoir near [[Kala'uun]] that washed an Imperial hover-train away.<ref name="Rebel Files">''[[Star Wars: The Rebel Files]]''</ref>

====A dangerous gambit====
By [[14 BBY]],<ref name="Galactic Atlas">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]''</ref> Cham had become the leader of the Free Ryloth Movement; which embarked on a guerrilla war against the Imperial protectorate and the puppet Senator Orn Free Taa. Under Cham's leadership, the Free Ryloth rebels built a network of informants, hidden bases, and storehouses. They launched raids on Imperial forces and disrupted Ryloth's [[spice]] trade. Cham was aided by the Imperial [[Colonel]] [[Belkor Dray]], who supplied the Free Ryloth movement with intelligence in order to subvert his superior, [[Moff]] [[Delian Mors]].<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

After losing his friend [[Pok]] and his team during a [[Mission to hijack an Imperial weapons shipment|mission]] to hijack an Imperial weapons shipment at [[Yaga Minor]], Cham decided to seek vengeance against Darth Vader and [[Galactic Emperor|the Emperor]] for the deaths of his comrades. An opportunity to move against the Sith leadership arose when Cham received intelligence that the Emperor and Vader decided to travel with Senator Orn Free Taa and his entourage to Ryloth. Cham informed his [[lieutenant]] [[Isval]] about the news and the two decided to contact Belkor in order to ascertain that this was not a trap. Cham desired to kill Vader and Sidious in order to bring an end to the Empire.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

Later that night, Cham and Belkor secretly met in Ryloth's cave network. Cham quickly ascertained that Belkor was not aware about the Emperor and Vader's visit and decided it was safe to proceed with the mission. When Belkor threatened to end their relationship by leaking a [[datacard|datadisk]] containing the Free Ryloth movement's bases and leadership in the event of his death, Cham put him in his place by threatening to disclose all their recorded communications to the Imperial authorities; exposing Belkor as a traitor. In the end, Belkor reluctantly agreed to supply intelligence to Cham's rebels in return for Cham using Taa's assassination to discredit Moff Delian.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

For the next nine days, Cham and his lieutenants Gobi Glie, [[Xira]], and [[Kallon]] set a trap for the Emperor's [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|Imperial Star Destroyer]] ''[[Perilous]]'' which included [[space mine]]s and a swarm of former Separatist [[Variable Geometry Self-Propelled Battle Droid, Mark I|Vulture droids]]. When the ''Perilous'' entered the [[Ryloth system]], Cham activated the first wave of mines which damaged the Star Destroyer. After Vader deployed [[Alpha-3 Nimbus-class V-wing starfighter|V-wing starfighters]] to combat the mines, Cham detonated a second wave of mines which drained the ''Perilous''{{'s}} shields. Gobi then deployed the Vulture droids and their [[Pistoeka sabotage droid|buzz droids]] cargo which proceeded to devastate the ''Perilous''.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

Cham then launched his third attack wave which involved getting Belkor to send Twi'lek repair crew to board the ship. The Free Ryloth movement had infiltrated three teams of operatives among the repair crew including one led by Isval. When Belkor threatened to walk out from Cham's conspiracy, the Twi'lek rebel leader threatened to expose his dealings with the rebels to the Empire. Despite the efforts of the Free Ryloth boarders, Vader and the Emperor managed to escape in a [[shuttle]] to [[Ryloth's equatorial forest]] before the ''Perilous'' blew up in space.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

While Isval and her team continued their hunt for the Sith Lords, Cham deployed two dozen [[Droid tri-fighter]]s to harass the Imperial V-wings. He then got Belkor to transmit the ship IDs of the Emperor's shuttle and Moff Delian's ship. Isval's stolen ship and the Emperor's shuttle crash-landed following a brief dogfight. Cham still kept in contact with Isval and her team of hunters. Following the destruction of the ''Perilous'', Cham and his surviving Free Ryloth forces retreated to the night side of Ryloth to plan the next stages of their operation. While Cham had depleted most of his forces in taking down the ''Perilous'', he vowed to continue his mission to assassinate the Emperor and Darth Vader.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

====Hunting the Sith Lords====
After consulting with Isval, Cham ordered Belkor to allow Isval's escort ship to attack the [[Equatorial Communications Hub]] in order to create a communications black-out to hamper the Imperial rescue efforts. In return, Belkor convinced Cham to transmit the trajectory of Delian's ship in order to eliminate his rival. Following the communications blackout, Cham kept in touch with his rebel operatives as they scoured through Ryloth's dangerous equatorial forests for the Sith Lords. Cham flew a shuttle which served as his mobile headquarters. However, Vader and the Emperor and their surviving [[Emperor's Royal Guard|royal guards]] proved more resourceful and adept at eluding the rebels and the dangerous fauna.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

Later that night, Cham learned that the Sith Lords had survived their crash-landing from Isval. After re-establishing contact with Belkor, Cham ordered him to eliminate Moff Delian by telling the Imperial forces searching for the Sith Lords that Delian was a traitor and that her ship was to be destroyed on sight. The two also conspired to order the Imperial V-wings to bomb the Emperor and Vader after they had located them. After learning that the Sith Lords had slaughtered an entire [[lylek]] hive, Cham issued orders for his forces not to directly engage Vader or the Emperor.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

Cham and his rebel comrades eventually tracked the Emperor and Vader down to a [[Drua's village|remote Twi'lek village]]. Meanwhile, Cham and Belkor's plans began to unravel when Moff Delian managed to convince the Imperial forces that she was not the traitor and that Belkor was the true traitor. She also countermanded Belkor's orders to attack the village by issuing new orders to transmit their coordinates to her. As the Free Ryloth forces converged on the quarry outside the village, Cham ordered his lieutenant Kallon to initiate an evacuation into the mountains to preempt an Imperial crackdown on Ryloth should the mission fail. He also ordered the Free Ryloth movement to disperse into their cells.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

Prior to the assault on the Twi'lek village, Cham ordered his men to fire warning shots so that the civilians could retreat into the mine shaft. Cham then ordered Belkor to get the V-wings to strike the village; unaware that Delian had already reasserted control over Belkor's forces. After Delian's V-wings destroyed Belkor's recon ship, Cham realized that his plan was beginning to crumble. Unwilling to abandon his plan to destroy the Sith Lords, Cham ordered his forces to storm the village. However, they were outflanked by Delian's [[stormtrooper]] reinforcements who arrived in two ships. From their position, Cham and his men fired at Vader and the Emperor.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

However, their blaster bolts missed their targets. Vader then climbed the quarry and pursued Cham and his fighters. Cham and his comrades managed to escape but Isval stayed behind to delay Darth Vader. Isval was subsequently captured and executed by the Sith Lords along with the surviving Free Ryloth soldiers and the villagers. Despite the defeat, Cham comforted himself with the knowledge that he still had a living daughter Hera Syndulla.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

====A difficult alliance====
[[File:The crew of the Ghost.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Cham joined forces with the Spectres to stop an Imperial cruiser-carrier.]]
After several years of having no contact with his daughter, Hera unexpectedly contacted her father Cham by [[hologram]]. Hera and her fellow rebels wanted to steal an Imperial [[Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier|''Quasar Fire''-class cruiser-carrier]] to provide a safe refuge for the rebellion's [[Phoenix Squadron]], which piloted [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor|A-wing starfighters]]. This same cruiser-carrier orbited Ryloth and housed several [[TIE/sa bomber]]s which frequently bombarded Ryloth. Seeing an opportunity to destroy the Imperial cruiser-carrier, Cham and two of his followers [[Numa]] and Gobi traveled on a [[Nu-class transport|''Nu''-class transport]] to rendezvous with Hera's starship ''[[Ghost]]'' in deep space.<ref name="Homecoming" />

After exchanging pleasantries with Hera and her crew, Cham and Hera settled down to business. During a briefing session, his daughter advocated hijacking and stealing the Imperial cruiser-carrier. As part of her plan, Hera advocated using a hijacked TIE bomber to infiltrate the Imperial warship. Wishing to destroy the Imperial starship in order to demonstrate the strength of the Free Ryloth movement, Cham disagreed with Hera. In response, his daughter contended that her father would have already destroyed the starship if they had the means to do it. Since this was not the case, Hera urged her father to compromise and work with fellow rebels for a change. After Hera's lover, Kanan backed her up, Cham reluctantly agreed to support Hera's plan but nodded to Numa and Gobi.<ref name="Homecoming" />

Following the briefing, Cham visited Hera to have a private talk with his daughter. Cham recognized Hera's astromech droid [[C1-10P|Chopper]] as the same droid she had rescued during the Battle of Ryloth. Still unhappy with his daughter's life choices, Cham reprimanded Hera for not devoting her life to freeing Ryloth and derided Chopper as a "second rate junkpile"; triggering an angry response from both. Hera responded by reiterating that the rebellion was fighting for everyone's freedom including Ryloth. Before storming out of the room, Cham remarked that outsiders could not be trusted and stressed that Ryloth was his most important cause.<ref name="Homecoming" />

On the way to Ryloth, Cham and his followers ingratiated themselves with Hera's crew. Cham regaled Kanan with stories of his exploits during the Battle of Lessu including his assault on the plasma bridge. Unknown to the Spectres, this was only a ruse for Cham to proceed with his original plan: destroying the Imperial cruiser-carrier. After exiting hyperspace, the two rebel factions exited Cham's shuttle and boarded Hera's stolen TIE bomber. Hera managed to trick the Imperials into allowing their bomber to land by arranging for two A-wing fighters to attack the bomber.<ref name="Homecoming" />

[[File:Hera and Cham Syndulla.png|left|thumb|300px|Cham reconciled with his daughter, Hera.]]
Having landed aboard the cruiser-carrier, Cham and his followers then put their true plan into action. While Num and Gobi [[stun]]ned Kanan, [[Sabine Wren]], [[Ezra Bridger]] and [[Garazeb Orrelios]], Cham knocked out Hera and Chopper. Before leaving, Cham handcuffed Hera to the cockpit to ensure that she did not interfere with their mission. Cham and his followers then overpowered a stormtrooper patrol that had been sent to the hangar bay. While Numa and Gobi headed to the munitions racks to plant their [[detonator]]s, Cham proceeded to disable the ship's [[hyperdrive]].<ref name="Homecoming" />

After disabling the hyperdrive's couplings on the third and fourth generators, Cham headed to the bridge to confront the captain and crew. However, Hera and the Spectres by then had freed themselves and taken Numa and Gobi prisoner. With both sides deadlocked, Cham and Hera argued. Following a lengthy argument, Hera managed to sway her father over by telling Cham how he had inspired her to join the rebellion. Upon learning that the Empire had marshaled reinforcements to retake the cruiser-carrier, Cham and his fellow Ryloth rebels decided to join forces with the Spectres in resisting the Empire.<ref name="Homecoming" />

When several TIE bombers damaged the cruiser-carrier's stabilizers, Cham and Hera joined forces to stabilize the ship. After instructing Chopper how to repair the ship's hyperdrive, Cham helped the other Spectres to destroy an approaching Imperial light cruiser by shoving a TIE bomber adrift into space. Cham then fired upon the bomber, triggering an explosion that also engulfed the nearby light cruiser. Having eliminated the Imperial forces, Cham and the Spectres took the cruiser into hyperspace.<ref name="Homecoming" />

By working together, the Ryloth and Spectres succeeded in galvanizing Twi'lek resistance against the Empire. With more Twi'leks joining the resistance, Cham reconciled his daughter whom he praised for sharing his wife's leadership qualities. After bidding their rebel allies farewell, Cham and his followers departed into space on their ''Nu''-class transport.<ref name="Homecoming" />

====Recovering the Kalikori====
Following the events above Ryloth, the Free Ryloth movement forged closer ties with Hera's rebel cell and the rebellion. Two years before the Battle of Yavin, a new Imperial commander named [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]] was sent to Ryloth. Studying Twi'lek culture, art, history, and philosophy, Thrawn was able to decide successful counterinsurgency tactics which led to the Imperial occupation of [[Tann Province]], the home of the Syndulla clan. Cham was forced to flee his [[Syndulla residence|family home]], leaving behind many artifacts including his late wife's [[Kalikori]] heirloom.<ref name="Hera's Heroes">{{Rebels|Hera's Heroes}}</ref>

Cham and Numa rode [[blurrg]]s to rendezvous with his daughter Hera, who was on a supply run. However, they were pursued by several [[scout trooper]]s on [[speeder bike]]s and an [[Imperial Troop Transport]]. Hera arrived with the ''Ghost'' and managed to scatter the Imperial forces. Cham and Numa along with their blurrgs escaped aboard the ''Ghost''. One of the scout troopers tried to follow them but was knocked out and had his armor stolen by the Spectres. Once aboard, Cham informed his daughter about the plight of the Free Ryloth movement.<ref name="Hera's Heroes" />

When Hera vowed to recover the Kalikori, Cham along with Numa, Gobi, and the Spectres volunteered to help. As part of the plan, Cham, the Ryloth rebels, Kanan, Sabine, and Zeb staged a diversionary attack on Imperial forces in [[Tulara Ravine]] while Hera, Ezra, and Chopper infiltrated the Syndulla household. Despite destroying a troop transport and an [[All Terrain Defense Pod|AT-DP walker]], the rebels were unable to stop the advance of a second AT-DP walker; which managed to blast through rock. Later, the rebels were contacted by Thrawn's subordinate [[Captain]] [[Slavin]] who issued an ultimatum. Slavin offered to spare the lives of Hera and Ezra if Cham surrendered to the Empire. If not, he threatened to execute the prisoners.<ref name="Hera's Heroes" />

Despite Gobi's pleas, Cham reluctantly complied out of fatherly love for his daughter. He traveled with the other rebels aboard the ''Ghost'' to Syndulla house to surrender. However, Hera and Chopper had devised an escape plan which involved igniting bombs throughout the house. Despite his shock at the sudden destruction of their home, Cham, Hera, Ezra, and Chopper took advantage of the resulting chaos to escape aboard the ''Ghost''. Thrawn allowed the rebels to escape because he believed they had earned their victory. Back aboard the ''Ghost'', Cham apologized for underestimating his daughter and emphasized his love for her. Despite failing to recover the Kalikori from Thrawn, Hera recognized that her father and her crew were her true family and home.<ref name="Hera's Heroes" />

==Personality and traits==
Cham Syndulla was a political revolutionary who opposed corruption and fought for Ryloth's freedom throughout his life. He was regarded as an extremist by the establishment Senator Orn Free Taa.<ref name="Databank" /> While distrustful of the Jedi and the Galactic Republic, Cham came to respect the Jedi for their role in liberating Ryloth from a Separatist invasion led by Emir Wat Tambor. Despite the scarcity of food during the Clone Wars, Cham still respected the tradition of hospitality and offered Master Windu food.<ref name="Liberty on Ryloth" /> Cham's respect for Master Windu persisted years after the liberation of Ryloth. Cham was a courageous fighter who often led his men into combat. <ref name="Homecoming" />

While Cham's suspicions about the Republic were proven right when it was transformed into the Empire after the Clone Wars, Syndulla still maintained his respect for the Jedi. Cham told his daughter Hera stories about the valor of the Jedi during the Clone Wars.<ref name="A New Dawn" /> As a patriot, Cham was solely devoted to achieving Ryloth's freedom from outsiders. This led him to neglect his daughter Hera, who found a friend in the form of her [[astromech droid]] Chopper. Despite their mutual love and respect, Cham and Hera later parted company after the two disagreed on the matter of whether Ryloth's freedom was linked to the galactic rebellion against the Empire.<ref name="Homecoming" />

As leader of the Free Ryloth movement, Cham was willing to use violence to achieve Ryloth's freedom from Imperial rule. Despite his suspicion of offworlders, Cham was still willing to work with the Imperial Colonel Belkor Dray, who supplied Cham with information on the Empire in order to discredit his boss Moff Delian Mors to boost his own career. Cham knew that Belkor could not be trusted since he was helping them for his own selfish gain. Thus, Cham recorded all of his meetings with Belkor in order to blackmail the colonel should he betray them to his Imperial superiors.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

Cham cared for his followers and sought to avenge the death of his lieutenant Pok at the hands of Darth Vader. After learning that the Emperor and Darth Vader were visiting Ryloth on a surprise trip, Cham engineered a trap for the two Sith Lords and their Star Destroyer ''Perilous''. Despite his careful planning, Cham underestimated the resourcefulness and bold cunning of his Sith adversaries. As a military commander, Cham also took steps to safeguard his rebel movement by dispersing them into hiding. Despite losing his opportunity to kill the Sith Lords and topple the Empire, Cham never gave up his devotion to the rebel cause. While ruthless in combat, Cham was unwilling to endanger civilians and took precautions to evacuate them before the fighting.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

Despite his distrust of the rebellion, Cham and his followers Gobi and Numa were willing to help his daughter Hera and her rebel cell to take out an Imperial fighter carrier that had been bombing Ryloth. Disagreeing with Hera's plans to steal the fighter instead of destroying it, Cham used his guile and charm to ingratiate the rebels and lull them into lowering their guard. Cham and his followers then proceeded with their plan to destroy the fighter carrier. However, Hera managed to sway him over by telling him that he had inspired her to join the rebellion. Due to their joint venture, Cham and his followers became more sympathetic of the rebellion.<ref name="Homecoming" />

Despite his skills as a guerrilla commander, Cham underestimated the capabilities of Grand Admiral Thrawn, who led the pacification of Tann province. Cham's love for his daughter Hera later led him to assist her in a plan to recover a family artifact, the Kalikori, from Thrawn. Thrawn and Captain Slavin attempted to exploit his love for his daughter by forcing Cham to surrender himself in return for sparing the lives of Hera and her rebel comrade Ezra Bridger. Though Hera destroyed their ancestral home during an escape attempt, he still respected her for her ingenuity and creativity.<ref name="Hera's Heroes" />

==Skills and abilities==
Cham Syndulla was a passionate revolutionary and skilled military commander. He knew how to ride a blurrg and how to wield [[blaster]]s and other weapons.<ref name="Liberty on Ryloth" /> A capable leader, Cham organized the Free Ryloth movement into an efficient fighting force backed by a network of informants, supply bases, and storage depots. Despite being outgunned, Cham was a resourceful commander who was adept at laying ambushes. On one occasion, he used space mines, Vulture droids, and disguised fighters to attack an Imperial Star Destroyer. Cham was also skilled at planning military operations and knew when to retreat.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

Cham was a capable warrior who often took part in the fighting. He was also familiar enough with the workings of [[starship]]s to disable their hyperdrives. While zealous in his goals, Cham could also listen to reason and be a team-player.<ref name="Homecoming" /> Cham was also skilled at outrunning pursuers while riding on his blurrg.<ref name="Hera's Heroes" />
