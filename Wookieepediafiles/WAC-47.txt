{{Quote|I am more than just a pilot!|WAC-47|A Sunny Day in the Void}}
'''WAC-47''' was a [[Sexes|masculine]]-programmed [[DUM-series pit droid]] who served the [[Galactic Republic]] during the [[Clone Wars]]. He was a part of [[D-Squad]] along with several other [[droid]]s on an important mission, serving under [[Colonel]] [[Meebur Gascon]] and piloting his ship.

WAC-47 was programmed as a [[pilot]], but felt he was capable of more. He repeatedly referred to Gascon by the incorrect rank of [[Corporal]], apparently as a part of a "program glitch." He did not get along well with Gascon at first, as he treated the droids as property,<ref name="databank" /> though they eventually came to understand and respect each other and WAC was promoted to [[Corporal]] by Gascon.<ref name="sunny">{{TCW|A Sunny Day in the Void}}</ref>

==Biography==
During the [[Clone Wars]], WAC-47 served in the [[91st Mobile Reconnaissance Corps|91st Recon Corps]], reporting to [[Clone Trooper]] [[Clone Commander|Commander]] [[CC-8826|Neyo]].<ref name="databank" /> In [[20 BBY]]<ref name="Galactic Atlas">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]''</ref>, WAC was drafted into Colonel [[Meebur Gascon]]'s [[D-Squad]]. WAC arrived late for Master Windu's briefing on their mission at the Jedi Temple. WAC assigned to pilot their [[D-Squad's Neimoidian shuttle|shuttle]]. During the initial start of their [[Mission to Aut-O's flagship|mission]], WAC piloted on a collision course to get the [[Providence-class dreadnought|''Providence''-class dreadnought's]] attention. After boarding the dreadnought, WAC was able to distract the battle droids stationed at the dreadnoughts vault. After acquiring the [[Encryption module]], WAC and the rest of the squad were then confronted by the dreadnought's [[Super tactical droid]], [[Aut-O]]. Together, they were able to put him out of commission and escape from the dreadnought.<ref name="secret" />

Enroute to Coruscant, WAC and D-squad's shuttle ran into ice comet swarm. Despite the difficulty, WAC was able to get the shuttle out of hyperspace. Unfortunately, the shuttle crashed on [[Abafar]]. WAC attempted to take command of the squad, but the unit abandoned him and Gascon. Together, they then discovered a [[Void strider/Canon|Void strider]] and use it to reach [[Pons Ora]] and rejoin the squad.<ref name="sunny" />
==Behind the scenes==
He is voiced by [[Ben Diskin]].

A possible Easter Egg occurs once WAC receives his "promotion", as the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAC_Corporal WAC Corporal] was a rocket used during the early days of the U.S Space Program.
