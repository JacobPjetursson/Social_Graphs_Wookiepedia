{{Quote|Jyn, trust the Force.|Lyra Erso to her daughter Jyn Erso|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story}}
'''Lyra Erso''' was the [[human]] [[Sexes|female]] [[Marriage|wife]] of the [[scientist]] [[Galen Walton Erso|Galen Erso]]. During the [[Clone Wars]], Galen was arrested while researching [[Kyber crystal]]s on [[Vallt]] and charged with [[Spy|espionage]] by [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Confederate]] loyalists. While in confinement, Lyra gave [[Reproduction|birth]] to their daughter, [[Jyn Erso|Jyn]]. The three were [[Rescue of Galen Erso|rescued]] by [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Orson Callan Krennic|Orson Krennic]], an old friend of her husband and a member of [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine's]] top secret [[Project Stardust|Death Star project]].

Krennic convinced Galen to continue his study in Kyber [[crystal]]s, and secretly used Galen's research in order to weaponize the crystals for use in the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]]. Over the course of several [[Standard year|years]], Lyra became suspicious of Krennic's motivations for saving her [[Erso family|family]], and was able to persuade Galen to abandon his research into Kyber crystals and flee [[Coruscant]] for [[Lah'mu]] with the help of [[Saw Gerrera]]. [[13 BBY|Four years later]], Krennic and a [[squad]] of [[death trooper]]s found the Erso family, and attempted to bring them all back to Coruscant. Lyra was [[Death|killed]] by a death [[trooper]] when she threatened Krennic with a [[blaster]].

[[0 BBY|Years later]], Jyn became part of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] and [[Battle of Scarif|stole]] [[Death Star plans|plans]] to the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]] [[battle station]], Krennic's achievement. With [[Rogue One (squad)|Rogue One's]] sacrifice, [[Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]] ordered the Death Star to fire at [[Scarif]], wiping out Rogue One and all Imperial forces present, including Krennic, proving Lyra's final words correct.

==Biography==
===Early Life===
Lyra Erso was [[Reproduction|born]] on [[Aria Prime]] in [[47 BBY]]. [[Sexes|She]] grew up as an only child and studied at the [[University of Rudrig]] in [[29 BBY]]. [[Lyra Erso's mother|Lyra's mother]] had to take out loans to fund her education, which Lyra later paid back from a job providing [[HoloNet]] footage.<ref name="Visual Guide" /> As a child, Lyra became friends with [[Nari Sable]].<ref name="Catalyst" />

===Marriage===
Lyra met [[Galen Walton Erso|Galen Erso]] at the age of [[26 BBY|21]], when she worked as a guide for [[Galen Erso's field team|Galen's team]] of [[scientist]]s studying [[crystal]]s on the [[planet]] [[Espinar]]. Lyra headed a survey team that discovered an intricate [[cave]] system and found crystals unique to the planet. Her expert knowledge of the cave system led to her being picked by Galen as his guide while he studied the crystals. While working together, Galen and Lyra fell in love and were [[Wedding of Lyra and Galen Erso|married]] [[25 BBY|six months later]] on the planet [[Coruscant]].<ref name="Catalyst" />

===Research on Vallt===
Three [[Standard year|years]] after [[Marriage|marrying]] Galen, as the [[Clone Wars]] began, Lyra worked as Galen's lab [[Aide|assistant]] during their [[time]] researching [[Kyber crystal]]s on the planet [[Vallt]] for [[Zerpen Industries]]. Lyra had an [[ear]] for mimicry, and was able to communicate with the local [[Valltii]] in their [[Valltii language|native]] [[language]] better than her husband.<ref name="Catalyst" />

It was just before coming to Vallt, that Lyra became pregnant with her and Galen's daughter, [[Jyn Erso|Jyn]]. In [[22 BBY]], a coup occurred on the planet with the help of the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. The previous ruler, [[King]] [[Chai (king)|Chai]], was [[Death|killed]] and replaced by [[Marshal]] [[Phara]], a Separatist ally. Galen and Lyra were caught while trying to escape Vallt, and Galen was arrested for [[Spy|espionage]] against the Confederacy.<ref name="Catalyst" />

While Galen was detained by the Vallti, Lyra was being held in the northern wing of the [[Keep]] in [[Tambolor]]. Jyn was born during this time in captivity; Galen was able to be present during the birth, even though he was being investigated for spying for the [[Galactic Republic]].<ref name="Catalyst" />

Six [[Standard month|months]] after the birth of Jyn, the [[Erso family]] was [[Rescue of Galen Erso|rescued]] from confinement by [[Orson Callan Krennic|Orson Krennic]] as part of a [[prisoner]] exchange program. Galen, Lyra, and Jyn were exchanged for [[Nan Pakota]] and [[Urshe Torr]], two prominent Separatist scientists. After the exchange, Krennic ordered the Keep to be destroyed by [[Republic military|Republic forces]], resulting in the death of Galen and Lyra's research partners and friends, as well as many inhabitants of the planet.<ref name="Catalyst" />

===Survey on Alpinn===
[[File:Lyra @ Alpinn.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Lyra on Alpinn]]
In [[18 BBY]], Krennic offered her a job surveying a cave system on the planet [[Alpinn]]. At first she was skeptical of his offer, correctly assuming that he just wanted her out of the way. In the end, however she accepted the offer at Galen's encouragement, bringing Jyn along for the three-month survey.<ref name="Catalyst" />

During their time on Alpinn, Lyra and Jyn stayed at the [[Alpinn archaeology camp]] with Lyra's old friend Sable, the [[pilot]] [[Has Obitt]], and other researchers.<ref name="Catalyst" />

The caves turned out not to be kybers, but [[ranite]], a related crystal.<ref name="Catalyst" />

On the way back to Coruscant, Lyra, Jyn, Nari, and Has stopped in [[orbit]] of [[Samovar]] and [[Wadi Raffa]], two planets being mercilessly stripped of resources useful to the Empire. Lyra was greatly unsettled and angry at the destructive [[mining]] operation, taking Krennic to task for the environmental devastation.<ref name="Catalyst" />

===Death===
{{Quote|You'll never win.|Lyra Erso's final words, to Orson Krennic|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story}}
The Erso family hid from [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] [[Imperial Military|forces]] for four years on the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] planet [[Lah'mu]]. While on the planet, the Ersos lead a self-sustaining life by growing crops and filtering [[water]] on their large [[Erso homestead|homestead]], procured for them by [[Saw Gerrera]]. Paranoid of being found by Krennic, the family created an elaborate plan to hide from Krennic, which included the building of an underground bunker beneath a small cave on their property. Krennic and a cadre of [[death trooper]]s finally found the Erso family and [[Capture of Galen Erso|confronted]] them. Lyra instructed Jyn to escape, but not before giving her a [[Jyn's kyber pendant|pendant]] of a Kyber crystal fragment, which she had taken from Galen's research materials as they escaped Coruscant.<ref name="Visual Guide" /> She then fled and her husband Galen told Krennic that she had passed away during their time on Lah'mu. To Galen's dismay, however, Lyra returned and confronted Krennic and his [[trooper]]s, threatening him with a [[blaster]]. Lyra was shot and killed by a trooper, causing her to shoot Krennic in his left shoulder postmortem, injuring him.<ref name="Rogue One" /> Lyra's body was taken aboard Krennic's shuttle on a gurney on the Director's orders. Krennic informed Galen that they would have a [[funeral]] for Lyra as soon they reached Corscuant and would be honored.<ref name="ROASWSN">''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (novelization)]]''</ref>

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Troublesome as ever.|Orson Krennic, regarding Lyra Erso|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story}}
Lyra studied the history and philosophy of the [[Jedi]] as an outgrowth of her reverence to the natural world. She agreed with the [[Jedi Order|Order's]] values of generosity, compassion, and peaceful resolution. Lyra believed she was able to feel [[the Force]], although she was unable to tap into it and use it like the Jedi.<ref name="Catalyst" /> While living on Coruscant during the early years of the Empire, Lyra began wearing a [[Color|red]] sash identified with sects of Force worshipers on planets such as [[Jedha]]. It was unknown whether she ever made contact with the [[Church of the Force]] which was developing on Coruscant at the same time.<ref name="Visual Guide" />

==Behind the scenes==
Lyra Erso was portrayed by [[Valene Kane]] in the [[2016]] [[Star Wars Anthology Series|film]] ''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''.<ref name="Valene Kane">{{Cite web|url=http://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/tv/fall-star-valene-kane-admits-11935240|title=The Fall star Valene Kane admits she was stunned after landing Star Wars role|work=Belfast Live|date=September 25, 2016|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref> The first footage of Lyra Erso was seen in the second International trailer released on [[November 10]], 2016.<ref name="Int. trailer 2">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTl_Tt3dhPw ''ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY'' International Trailer #2 (2016)]</ref>

In an earlier version of the film's script, Lyra was meant to be a Jedi, but this plot point was quickly abandoned because the creative team thought that it was better to examine how the lives of normal inhabitants of [[the galaxy]] were after the downfall of the Jedi Order following [[Order 66]].<ref name="AoRO">''[[The Art of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''</ref>
