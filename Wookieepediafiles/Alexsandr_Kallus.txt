{{Quote|You have the heart of a rebel.|Thrawn, to Alexsandr Kallus|Zero Hour}}
'''Alexsandr Kallus''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] revolutionary who served as an [[agent]] of the [[Imperial Security Bureau]], operating number '''ISB-021''', before becoming a rebel [[spy]] in the formative days of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]].

As an [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] operative, Kallus was a firm believer in bringing order to [[the galaxy]]. He worked to suppress dissent on numerous worlds, fighting [[Campaigns of Saw Gerrera's Partisans|against]] the [[Partisans|insurgency]] of [[Saw Gerrera]] on [[Onderon]], participating in the [[Siege of Lasan|genocide]] on [[Lasan]], and leading the hunt for the [[Spectres|rebels]] of the ''[[Ghost]]'' on [[Lothal]]. His efforts on Lothal were largely unsuccessful, leading to an escalation of force against the growing rebellion in the form of both [[Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]], [[Governor]] of the [[Outer Rim Territories]], and the [[Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]].

After pursuing the ''Ghost'' crew for over [[Standard year|one year]], Kallus [[Ambush on an Imperial construction module|attempted]] to trap them in [[orbit]] of [[Geonosis]]. In the ensuing conflict, Kallus and one of the ''Ghost'' crew members, the [[Lasat]] warrior [[Garazeb Orrelios]], were trapped on the [[Water|frozen]] [[moon]] [[Bahryn]]. They found kinship as [[soldier]]s as they worked together to survive, and Kallus learned more about the rebels and their camaraderie. It was enough to make him question his beliefs about the Empire and the rebellion, and he covertly became a rebel spy under the codename of '''[[Fulcrum (title)|Fulcrum]]''', thanks to Zeb. He fed the rebellion information about the Empire's activities, including those of [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]], who was tasked with eliminating the rebels of the [[Lothal sector]].

Thrawn discovered Kallus' true allegiance after realizing there was a rebel spy in his midst, and Kallus was captured as he attempted to feed the rebels information for their planned attack on Lothal. Ultimately, Thrawn discovered the [[Chopper Base|rebel base]] on [[Atollon]] and launched an [[Battle of Atollon|attack]] that devastated the rebellion. Kallus broke free of Imperial custody during the battle and was taken in by the ''Ghost'', and accompanied the surviving rebels to the [[Great Temple (Yavin 4)|base]] on [[Yavin 4]], thus escaping from certain execution.

Becoming a full-fledged member of the Rebellion, Kallus assisted the Alliance both tactically and in the battlefield. As a key ally of the ''Ghost'' crew, he aided them in their successful [[Liberation of Lothal|liberation]] of Lothal. After the Empire's demise in [[4 ABY]], Orrelious brought Kallus to [[Lira San]], the ancient home of the Lasat people, to show the former ISB Agent that he had not destroyed the Lasat species after all. As a friend to Orrelios who turned against his former Empire, the Lasat welcomed Kallus as one of their own.

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Quote|We all have things we don't forget. I remember my first unit, the boys and I were sent to Onderon to bring peace to a troubled world. We were on a routine patrol when we ran into one of your rebel friends, a Lasat mercenary who worked for Saw Gerrera. I was lucky, knocked out by the first blast. I came to, but found I couldn't move, and then I saw him. The Lasat calmly walked through smoke and fire to finish off my unit one by one. The injured never had a chance, always wondered why he let me live.|Agent Kallus, to Garazeb Orrelios|The Honorable Ones}}
[[File:Kallus sideburns.png|left|188px|thumb|Agent Kallus helped enforce the will of the Empire]]
Alexsandr Kallus,<ref name="Databank">{{Databank|alexsandr-kallus|Alexsandr Kallus|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/sF7cI}}</ref> a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]], was born on [[Coruscant]]<ref name="Visual Guide" /> several [[Standard year|years]] prior to the [[Invasion of Naboo]], during the final years of the [[Galactic Republic]].<ref name="Visual Guide Year" /> After [[Darth Sidious]], publicly known as [[Supreme Chancellor]] Palpatine, declared himself [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] and transformed the Republic into the [[Galactic Empire]], Kallus attended the [[Royal Imperial Academy]] on Coruscant, the main campus of the new regime's [[Imperial Military|military]] [[Imperial Academy|training program]].<ref name="KH" /> At the Academy, Kallus notably studied under [[Wullf Yularen]], who considered him one of his star pupils.<ref name="TIE">{{Rebels|Through Imperial Eyes}}</ref> He also befriended [[Jovan (Lieutenant)|Jovan]], who soon became an informal mentor to the young [[Coruscanti]]. Eventually, the two completed their course of study together,<ref name="KH" /> with Kallus graduating head of his class.<ref name="AbEverything">''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know]]''</ref> Later on, Kallus joined the [[Imperial Security Bureau]],<ref name="Visual Guide" /> a secret task force that pursued and destroyed rebellious activity throughout [[the galaxy]].<ref name="ISB Databank">{{Databank|imperial-security-bureau|Imperial Security Bureau}}</ref> Kallus was codenamed ISB-021 and became a high-ranked ISB [[Agent]],<ref name="Visual Guide" /> working in both the [[Internal Affairs]] branch and the [[Investigations]] branch of the bureau.<ref name="AbEverything" />

During his first time as an ISB agent, Kallus led his own [[Alexsandr Kallus' first Imperial platoon|platoon]] of [[stormtrooper]]s. One day, Kallus and his platoon were sent by the Empire to bring order to the planet [[Onderon]], a planet left in [[Onderon insurgency|chaos]] after the [[Clone Wars]], due to their former occupation by the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] and the false [[King]], [[Sanjay Rash]]. During a routine patrol a rebel mercenary, a [[Unidentified Lasat mercenary|Lasat]], working for [[Saw Gerrera]], ambushed the platoon and knocked out Kallus. When the ISB agent came to, he found he couldn't move and was forced to watch as his squad was brutally murdered by the Lasat mercenary. Kallus would remember this moment during his next mission, the [[Siege of Lasan|Fall of Lasan]].<ref name="The Honorable Ones" />

Kallus took part in the cleansing of the [[planet]] [[Lasan]], in which the planet's species, the [[Lasat]], was all but destroyed and completely driven away from their homeworld. Kallus gave the order for Imperial troops to use [[T-7 ion disruptor rifle]]s against the population. These rifles were powerful enough to disable starships and had gruesome results when used against sentient beings. These weapons were ultimately banned by the [[Imperial Senate]] as a result of their destructive power.<ref name="Droids in Distress">{{Rebels|Droids in Distress}}</ref> Before the cleansing of Lasan ended, Kallus was given a [[J-19 bo-rifle]] by a member of the [[Lasan High Honor Guard]] that he had defeated.<ref name="The Honorable Ones" />

===Hunting Solo===
[[File:Kallus & IG-88.jpg|thumb|right|313px|Kallus and IG-88 tracking Han solo.]]
Kallus worked with [[IG-88]] in tracking down [[Imperial Army]] [[deserter]] turned smuggler Captain [[Han Solo]] of the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. Kallus took a [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle|shuttle]] and found Solo during one of his smuggling operations. Kallus, after learning about Solo [[Skirmish on Savareen|aiding]] [[Enfys Nest]] on [[Savareen]], declared Solo an enemy of the Empire. He believed that Solo was smuggling items to Nest and ordered IG-88 to check Solo's cargo. However, Kallus and IG-88 were attacked by Solo's co-pilot, [[Chewbacca]]. Despite Solo and Chewbacca escaping, Kallus and IG-88 returned to the shuttle. Kallus ordered two Star Destroyers to not allow the ''Falcon'' to pass them. However, the ''Falcon'' was able to go between the two Star Destroyers and escape. Kallus could not believe how reckless Solo was.<ref name="Spy Games">{{IDWAdventuresCite|14|[[Flight of the Falcon, Part 1: Spy Games]]}}</ref>

===Spark of rebellion===
====Trapping the ''Ghost''====
{{Quote|It could signify the spark of rebellion. Next time they make a move we'll be waiting for them to snuff out that spark before it catches fire.|Agent Kallus|Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion}}
[[5 BBY|Five]] years before the [[Battle of Yavin]], a [[Spectres|rebel cell]] operated on [[Lothal]], where they hit a number of Imperial targets. These attacks drew the attention of the Imperial Security Bureau, who sent Kallus to Lothal to handle the situation. He arrived aboard a [[shuttle]] and requested permission to dock aboard the ''[[Lawbringer]]'', an [[Imperial I-class Star Destroyer|''Imperial I''-class Star Destroyer]] that orbited the planet. Kallus was given permission to dock by [[Captain]] [[Hiram Zataire]], with whom he later had dinner aboard the ''Lawbringer''; Kallus' goal with the meal was to determine if he could trust Zataire as a loyal Imperial officer. The two discussed Zataire's [[Hiram Zataire's son|son]], an outspoken critic of the Empire, after Kallus deduced that the [[wine]] the captain served him was from [[Alderaan]]&mdash;a planet deemed to be rebellious by the Empire&mdash;and that it had been given to the captain as a gift by his son. This allowed Kallus to realize that Zataire's son was on Alderaan, giving the ISB a chance to arrest him, and Zataire pleaded with Kallus not to hurt him. The ISB Agent said that the law could allow him to be flexible so long as Captain Zataire fully cooperated with Kallus' operations on Lothal, a request that the captain agreed to. Kallus' first order to the captain was to have the ''Lawbringer'' descend from orbit and hover over [[Capital City]], where the citizens of Lothal would be able to witness the Empire's might.<ref name="The Rebellion Begins" />

[[File:Snuff out the Spark.png|thumb|288px|left|Kallus tells Commandant Aresko about his plan to stop the rebels.]]
As the ''Lawbringer'' hovered over the capital, the rebels carried out an operation against the Empire where they [[Heist in Capital City|stole]] crates full of [[blaster]]s and food. That night, Kallus inspected the damage caused by the Empire. He was briefed by [[Commandant]] [[Cumberlayne Aresko]],<ref name="Spark">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion]]''</ref> one of the leading military officers on Lothal,<ref name="Visual Guide" /> about the attack, and Kallus explained that it was part of a pattern&mdash;one that, if not stopped, could lead to a larger rebel movement.<ref name="Spark" />

In an effort to destroy the rebels, Kallus prepared a trap to lure them in by making the rebels believe they had learned the location of [[Wookiee]] [[Slavery|slaves]] being held by the Empire. Although the Empire was holding Wookiee prisoners, the rebels were fed false information as to their location, and the ''Ghost'' docked with a [[Gozanti-class cruiser|''Gozanti''-class cruiser]] that the rebels believed held the slaves. [[Jedi]] survivor [[Kanan Jarrus]], Lasan High Honor Guardsman [[Garazeb Orrelios]], Mandalorian warrior [[Sabine Wren]], and the droid [[C1-10P]] boarded the ship, while the ''Lawbringer'' dropped out of [[hyperspace]] and captured the ''Gozanti''-class cruiser and the ''Ghost''. With the ships captured, Kallus and his stormtroopers also boarded the cruiser and attacked the rebels. Wren and the droid shut down the gravity generator on the ship, taking the Imperials by surprise and giving the rebels an opportunity to escape. As they did, Kallus was able to capture [[Ezra Bridger]], a new member of the ''Ghost'' crew who had boarded to warn the rebels that the ''Lawbringer'' had arrived.<ref name="Spark" />

With Bridger in custody, Kallus intended to use the boy in order to lure the rebels back, believing that they would mount a rescue attempt. Kallus spoke to Bridger in his cell and told the young rebel of the plan, but Bridger did not believe that the ''Ghost'' would return, as he had never seen anyone risk their lives for other people before. Despite Bridger's insistence, the rebels did ultimately return, though the boy escaped from his holding cell on his own. The ''Ghost'' landed in the lower hangar, which the Imperials detected. Kallus ordered all stormtroopers to converge on the lower hangar, where he would meet them, though he diverted some to the upper hangar; Bridger, who was listening to Imperial communications through a stolen [[stormtrooper armor|stormtrooper helmet]], posed as a stormtrooper and suggested that the lower hangar could be a diversion.<ref name="Spark" />

[[File:Kallus Caught in Explosion.png|thumb|288px|right|Kallus is caught in an explosion caused by the rebels.]]
Kallus led his stormtroopers to the lower hangar, where he found that Bridger had already met back up with the rebels. The rebels fled at the sight of the Imperial troops, who pursued them and fired on the ''Ghost''. As the rebel ship was preparing to depart, Kallus noticed [[graffiti]] art on the hangar floor, which had been drawn by Wren, and realized it was an explosive. He ordered his men to take cover, but the explosion ripped through the hangar and some of his men. Kallus, however, survived, and was thrown forward by the explosion. The damage caused a hull breach, and many stormtroopers were blown out into space. Kallus himself was nearly pulled into space as well, but he held onto the hangar deck long enough for a force field to cover the damage to the hull. He remained in the hangar as the Imperials recovered from the rebel attack, and was brought the helmet that Bridger stole and left behind;prompting the ISB Agent to realize that Bridger had overheard that the true location of the Wookiee prisoners was the [[Spice mines of Kessel|spice mines]] of the planet [[Kessel]].<ref name="Spark" />

Knowing that the rebels would not pass up the opportunity to rescue the Wookiees, Kallus allowed the rebels to reach Kessel, where they freed the Wookiee slaves from the Imperial forces stationed in [[spice mine K76]]. Before the rebels could leave, however, Kallus and additional Imperial forces arrived, firing on the ''Ghost'' and forcing it to flee while the rest of the rebels remained in the mine. Kallus and a squadron of stormtroopers landed at the mine and advanced on the rebels, forcing them to take cover. With the rebels pinned down, the rebel leader, Jarrus, stepped forward and ignited a [[lightsaber]], revealing himself as a Jedi who had survived the [[Order 66|destruction]] of the [[Jedi Order]]. Kallus ordered all of his soldiers to focus their fire on Jarrus, which gave the rest of the rebels and the Wookiees a chance to enter a cargo container, which would be [[22 pickup|picked up]] by the ''Ghost'' when it returned.<ref name="Spark" />

[[File:Kallus Falls Over Ledge.png|thumb|250px|left|Having been hit by deflected laser fire, Kallus falls over a railing in the mines.]]
While the stormtroopers focused on the rebels, Kallus followed Bridger to a walkway overlooking the mine, where the boy had gone to rescue [[Kitwarr]], a young Wookiee who had escaped and was chased by [[Unidentified stormtrooper (Kessel)|a stormtrooper]]. Kallus arrived to see Bridger attack the stormtrooper with an [[energy slingshot]], knocking the trooper over the railing. Kallus believed that Bridger was Jarrus' apprentice and prepared to kill the boy, but the ''Ghost'' arrived to rescue Bridger. Jarrus, who stood atop the ship, deflected Kallus' fire back at the ISB Agent. Kallus was struck with blaster fire, knocking him over the railing, which he held onto as the ''Ghost'' escaped. The stormtrooper, who had also fallen over, clung to the railing as well and asked if Jarrus was the first Jedi that Kallus had ever seen. In response, Kallus kicked the trooper off the railing, sending him falling into the mines.<ref name="Spark" />

Kallus left the spice mines and returned to the ''Lawbringer'', which remained in orbit over Kessel. From the ship, Kallus contacted [[the Grand Inquisitor]],<ref name="Spark" /> a [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]] warrior tasked with hunting down Jedi survivors.<ref name="Inquisitor Databank">{{Databank|the-inquisitor|The Inquisitor}}</ref> Kallus told the Inquisitor, who appeared via [[hologram]], about what happened on Kessel and that the leader of the rebel cell was a Jedi, to which the Inquisitor said Kallus had done well to inform him of.<ref name="Spark" />

====Droid distress call====
{{Quote|Have no fear. Help is on the way.|Kallus, to C-3PO|Droids in Distress}}
After their successful rescue of the Wookiees, the rebels engaged in a [[Mission to steal Imperial weapons|mission]] to steal T-7 ion disruptor rifles from the planet [[Garel]]. It was there that [[Minister]] [[Maketh Tua]] of Lothal was attempting to procure the illegal weapons from [[Amda Wabo]], an [[Aqualish]] weapons manufacturer. The rebels were able to reach the disruptors before the Imperials could and stopped the arms deal, taking the weapons for themselves&mdash;as well as two [[droid]]s, [[R2-D2]] and [[C-3PO]], who were part of the arms deal on orders of [[Governor]] [[Arihnda Pryce]] of Lothal and who were covertly working for the secretly rebellious [[Senator]] [[Bail Organa]] of Alderaan. After the rebels stole the weapons, Tua contacted Agent Kallus and informed him of what had transpired on Garel, and Kallus recognized it as the work of the ''Ghost'' crew. C-3PO, believing himself to be the prisoner of criminals, attempted to send a distress signal to Governor Pryce, but the signal was rerouted and intercepted by Kallus aboard the ''Lawbringer''. C-3PO provided Kallus with the location of the ''Ghost'', and Kallus lied by telling the droid that help was on the way.<ref name="Droids in Distress" />

[[File:Kallus bo-rifle.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Kallus engages Orrelios in bo-rifle combat.]]
The rebels returned to Lothal, where they intended to sell the disruptors to the [[Devaronian]] crime lord [[Cikatro Vizago]]. Before the deal could be completed, Kallus and his forces arrived in [[Imperial Troop Transport]]s, bringing [[All Terrain Defense Pod]]s with them. While the stormtroopers and AT-DPs fought most of the rebels, Kallus challenged Orrelios to single combat with bo-rifles. The enraged Lasat met the ISB Agent in battle, and the two fought while the rebels took on the Imperial forces and destroyed the disruptors. By the end of their duel, in which Kallus taunted Orrelios about the fall of Lasan, Orrelios was nearly beaten. Kallus attempted to make a fatal blow, but he was stopped by Bridger, who used [[the Force]] to push Kallus away. This gave the rebels a chance to escape, leaving Kallus behind to watch the ''Ghost'' fly away.<ref name="Droids in Distress" />

====Incident at the Academy====
{{Quote|Sir, your podracer parts have been delivered. If you'll just sign off here, I'll bring them up.''"''<br />''"''Obviously there's been a mistake. What would I want with ''podracer'' parts?|Zare Leonis and Agent Kallus|Breaking Ranks}}
[[File:Kallus Breaking Ranks.png|thumb|250px|left|Kallus takes a datapad from Bridger, who was disguised as a cadet.]]
Some time later, the rebels put together a plan to [[Mission to destroy a kyber crystal|infiltrate]] the [[Academy for Young Imperials]] on Lothal and steal a [[decoder]] from Kallus' office, located within the Academy; this decoder would allow them to find the location of a giant [[kyber crystal]] of massive power, which the rebels wanted to destroy. Bridger was the one who infiltrated the Academy, posing as a cadet named Dev Morgan. After several weeks in the facility, Bridger made his move to sneak into Kallus' office. Once he arrived, he found Kallus leaving his office. Bridger, who had won a cadet tournament to serve as an aide in the [[Imperial Complex (Lothal)|Imperial Complex]], arrived&mdash;wearing a helmet to disguise himself&mdash;with a [[datapad]] that he was sent to deliver. The rebel offered to leave it on the ISB Agent's desk, but Kallus took it himself and left the area. Once Kallus was gone, Bridger entered the office but was stopped by fellow cadet [[Zare Leonis]], who knew that the theft would set off an alarm. The two joined forces, as Leonis also harbored anti-Imperial sentiments, and resolved to steal the decoder together.<ref name="Breaking Ranks">{{Rebels|Breaking Ranks}}</ref>

The two rebels executed their plan the next day. Bridger snuck through a ventilation shaft in order to reach Kallus' office from above. Leonis, meanwhile, requested permission to enter Kallus' office. The cadet told Kallus that the Agent's [[podracer]] parts had arrived, and Kallus questioned the order, as he had not requested nor did he have need of any podracer parts. Leonis insisted that the parts were for Kallus, stalling the Agent so as to buy Bridger time to steal the decoder. Bridger used the Force to levitate the decoder, and it floated up to the opening of the ventilation shaft. Kallus noticed Leonis' surprised reaction to the use of the Force and turned around, but Bridger had completed the theft before the Agent could see him. Leonis asked him one more time if he would be signing for the podracer parts, but Kallus refused, insisting it was a mistake.<ref name="Breaking Ranks" />

As he was making his way back through the vents, Bridger learned that he and a fellow cadet, [[Jai Kell]], had shown skills that were of interest to the Inquisitor, who planned to arrive on Lothal the next day to test them. As a result, Bridger, Leonis, and Kell mounted an escape from the Academy. Leonis reminded behind, however, as he had unfinished business at the Academy; he pretended to try to stop the rebels from escaping so as to avoid suspicion. When the Inquisitor arrived, Kallus was present when the Inquisitor arrived and was informed about the escape. The Inquisitor recognized "Cadet Morgan" as Bridger, as he had [[Duel on Stygeon Prime|encountered]] him on [[Stygeon Prime]], indicating that Bridger's presence was an infiltration.<ref name="Breaking Ranks" />

====Hunting Lieutenant Jovan====
{{Quote|You wouldn't shoot an unarmed man, would you? Have some mercy&hellip;''"<br />"''There is no mercy, "friend".|Lieutenant Jovan and Kallus|Kallus' Hunt}}
[[File:Jovan_arrested.png|thumb|200px|right|Jovan was apprehended by Kallus on Lothal.]]
After the incident at the Academy,<ref name="Twit">{{Twitter|tronprogram2|status/632249584497098752|[[Martin Fisher]]|quote=@LelalMekha The comic took place in between the episodes Breaking Ranks and Out of Darkness.|image=File:Kallus_Hunt_placement_tweet.png}}</ref> Agent Kallus was tasked with arresting his former friend and mentor Jovan, who had started using his status as an Imperial lieutenant on [[Ganthel]] to ensure his own wealth. Kallus managed to track down Jovan to the small Lothalian town of [[Dinar]]. The two engaged in an alleway scuffle. Jovan managed to flee, jumping in a stolen TIE starfighter, but Kallus gave him chase over the plains of Lothal aboard another fighter. Although he was a lesser pilot than his old acquaintance, the ISB agent managed to take the rogue lieutenant down, using a maneuver he had learned from him when they still got along. Defeated, Jovan asked Kallus to let him go for old time's sake, but the agent refused to let his personal feelings override his loyalty to the Empire. Kallus then returned to the Imperial headquarters on Lothal while his former friend was being brought to [[Prison|jail]].<ref name="KH" />

====Empire Day====
{{Quote|These rebels have ruined Empire Day! They must be punished!''"''<br />''"''We all want that, Minister, but our priority is still the Rodian.|Minister Maketh Tua and Agent Kallus|Empire Day (episode)}}
[[File:Tsoklo and Kallus.png|left|thumb|250px|Kallus hunting for the Rodian fugitive Tseebo]]
The Imperial regime on Lothal planned a series of celebrations for [[Empire Day]], marking the fifteenth anniversary of the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the Galactic Empire. On Empire Day, the local government also began looking for a [[Rodian]] named [[Tseebo]], who stole critical information from the [[Imperial Information Office]] where he was employed. Kallus participated in the search for the Rodian, doing so even at the Empire Day parade in Capital City. During the parade, the rebels destroyed an experimental [[TIE Advanced v1]] starfighter. After they fled from the scene, Kallus took charge of the investigation into finding them and requested schematics of the city's ventilation systems, sewers, and anywhere else that the rebels could have been hiding. Minister Tua demanded that the rebels be punished for disrupting Empire Day, and Kallus assured her that he wanted them punished as well, but their priority was still to find Tseebo.<ref name="Empire Day">{{Rebels|Empire Day (episode)|Empire Day}}</ref>

Having escaped from the scene of the attack, the rebels hid at the childhood home of Ezra Bridger, where they found Tseebo hiding; Tseebo had been a friend of Bridger's parents before they disappeared several years earlier. The rebels discovered the information that Tseebo had stolen and resolved to [[Rescue of Tseebo|get him off]] of the planet in order to study the secrets he had stolen. To get him out of the city, the rebels hijacked an Imperial Troop Transport. Kallus learned of the hijacking and contacted Commandant Aresko, who had set up a blockade at the edge of the city, to warn him of the incoming rebels. The rebels nonetheless blasted their way through the blockade and escaped to the outskirts of the city.<ref name="Empire Day" />

Kallus arrived in his own ITT and pursued the rebels out of the city. While in pursuit, Kallus contacted the Inquisitor to inform him that the rebels had broken through the main city gate and were headed south. The Inquisitor, who was boarding his own [[The Inquisitor's TIE Advanced|TIE Advanced fighter]], suspected that the ''Ghost'' would be waiting and ordered Kallus to slow their escape. Kallus' men blew a hole in the hijacked ITT and attempted to board, while Kallus' ITT continued firing. Kallus made his way to the roof of his ITT and jumped onto the rebels', just as the ''Ghost'' arrived. Orrelios fired at Kallus, wanting to end his vendetta against the Agent once and for all, as Kallus ordered his ITT to fire on the ''Ghost''. The ''Ghost'', in turn, destroyed Kallus' ITT. Orrelios, having missed the first time, once again fired on Kallus, knocking him from the side of the rebels' ITT&mdash;though he was able to hold on to the back of the vehicle.<ref name="Empire Day" />

[[File:Zeb fires at Kallus.png|thumb|250px|right|Orrelios fires on Kallus from the ''Ghost''.]]
The rebels began their escape onto the ''Ghost'', heading to the top of the stolen ITT in order to quickly board the ship. Kallus climbed back atop the ITT in time to witness Tseebo stepping onto the ramp that the ''Ghost'' had lowered. He fired towards the rebels, prompting Jarrus to ignite his lightsaber and confront the ISB Agent. The Jedi deflected Kallus' blasts before jumping aboard the ''Ghost'', which flew away to escape Lothal. As it was departing, Kallus contacted the Inquisitor to confirm that Tseebo was aboard the rebel ship. The Inquisitor and his fighters pursued the rebels off of Lothal,<ref name="Empire Day" /> but was ultimately unsuccessful in stopping them or capturing Tseebo.<ref name="Gathering Forces">{{Rebels|Gathering Forces}}</ref>

Following the rebel attack on the Empire Day celebrations, Governor Arihnda Pryce ordered a planet wide crackdown on sedition and dissent. Agent Kallus was placed in charge of the crackdown and all military personnel on Lothal including [[Imperial cadet]]s were conscripted to take part. Under Kallus' orders, Imperial cadets were used to question residents about illegal activities in their neighbourhoods, apprehend criminals, detain the children of fugitives, and to lead stormtroopers on law enforcement raids. Kallus' tough stance on crime and orders to detain children appalled some Imperials like Cadet Zare Leonis and [[Lieutenant]] [[Chiron (lieutenant)|Chiron]] but they knew better than to openly defy his orders since the crackdown had the support of the governor and all Imperial ministries on Lothal.<ref name="Imperial Justice">''[[Servants of the Empire: Imperial Justice]]''</ref>

====The poisoned supplies====
{{Quote|I thought poisoning the food you stole might teach you a lesson about stealing Imperial property!|Kallus, to Orrelios|Sabotaged Supplies}}
Knowing that the rebels regularly stole foodstuffs from the Empire, Kallus decided to take it to his advantage. The agent tampered with supplies and let the rebels capture them so their content would poison whoever ate them. As expected, several residents of the refugee settlement of [[Lothal re-settlement camp 43|Tarkintown]] ate the poisoned food and fell ill, which prompted Garazeb Orrelios to raid the Imperial compound on his own in search of an antidote. When Orellios reached the medical facility, Kallus was waiting for him with four stormtroopers. The ISB agent started dueling with the Lasat and got the upper hand for a time. However, the tide turned when Hera Syndulla, Kanan Jarrus, Sabine Wren and Ezra Bridger came to the rescue of their friends, overpowered the Imperials, and then managed to escape the compound.<ref name="Sabotaged">{{SWRMCite|7|Sabotaged Supplies}}</ref>

====Trap in the Senate Building====
{{Quote|If you won't talk, then my troopers will become a firing squad.|Kallus, to the rebels|Vision of Hope}}
[[File:Kallus shoots in the Senate.png|thumb|left|250px|Kallus opens fire on the rebels.]]
Having failed to stop the rebels on Empire Day, Kallus put together a plan to lure the rebels into a trap and eliminate them. The plan utilized Senator [[Gall Trayvis]], who worked for the Empire by posing as a voice of dissent in order to monitor and lure rebel forces across the galaxy into traps. Trayvis sent out a message via a hacked [[HoloNet News]] transmission where he said he would meet the rebels in the [[Lothal City Capitol Building]] on Lothal. The rebels took the bait and Kallus prepared the trap, though Minister Tua questioned whether it would work. The plan looked to be succeeding when the rebels arrived in the Senate Building, as Kallus and his forces were able to corner Jarrus, Bridger, [[Hera Syndulla]], and Trayvis; the rebels had arrived believing that Trayvis was in danger and that the Empire intended to capture him. Kallus identified Jarrus and Bridger, calling the latter "Jabba"<ref name="Vision of Hope">{{Rebels|Vision of Hope}}</ref> as a nod to their first encounter,<ref name="Spark" /> and encountered Syndulla for the first time. He demanded that they reveal where Orrelios and Wren were or else face a firing squad. The Imperials were thrown off when Orrelios and Wren, who had entered the building from the roof, threw smoke bombs between the rebels and Imperials, allowing the rebels to fight their way out and escape.<ref name="Vision of Hope" />

The rebels were able to escape from being cornered and made their way into the sewers beneath the Senate Building, and Kallus and his troopers pursued them. The rebels split up, with Bridger and Syndulla taking Trayvis while the others fled in a different direction. Trayvis revealed his true allegiance to Syndulla and Bridger, but they were able to knock him unconscious just before they reunited with the other rebels. Kallus and his forces arrived as Jarrus used the Force to stop a large fan that stood between the rebels and their freedom, and the ISB Agent ordered his forces to open fire on Jarrus. The Imperials were too late, however, as the rebels were able to successfully escape.<ref name="Vision of Hope" />

====Working under Tarkin====
{{Quote|And, Agent Kallus. Have you just stood idly by while this rabble have attacked our men, destroyed our property and disrupted our trade?''"<br>"''I have exhausted every resource to capture them, sir. This group has proven quite elusive.|Tarkin and Agent Kallus' first meeting|Call to Action}}
[[File:Rebel Resolve thumb.png|thumb|right|250px|Agent Kallus and Tarkin interrogating the captured Jedi Kanan Jarrus]]
The Spectres' activities eventually drew the attention of [[Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]] who visited Lothal. Agent Kallus along with the Minister Maketh Tua and the Inquisitor were part of the grand reception that greeted Tarkin's shuttle at the Imperial headquarters. During the meeting, Tarkin reprimanded Kallus for allowing the rebels to attack Imperial personnel, destroy Imperial property, and disrupt the Empire's trade. Kallus was ashamed to admit failure and responded that he had exhausted every resource to capture them but that the rebels had been elusive. When Minister Tua mentioned that the rebel leader Kanan Jarrus was a Jedi, a skeptical Tarkin claimed that all the Jedi had perished during the [[Jedi Purge]]. Kallus thought that Tarkin's arrival would provide him with the resources needed to capture the insurgents.<ref name="Battle to the End">''[[Battle to the End]]''</ref>

After the Spectres ambushed an Imperial supply convoy in the town of [[Jalath]], Kallus was present at a meeting where Tarkin ordered the Inquisitor to execute the Imperial officers Commandant Aresko and Taskmaster Grint for their repeated failures to stop the Lothal rebel cell. Agent Kallus and Minister Tua were visibly horrified by the Grand Moff's actions since their two men had been loyal but incompetent Imperials. Nevertheless, Kallus took it as a lesson that failure in the Empire would no longer be tolerated. Tarkin then ordered Agent Kallus to dispatch [[probe droid]]s throughout Lothal to locate the rebels. Troubled by the execution of Aresko and Grint, Kallus vowed not to allow himself to experience such a fate.<ref name="Battle to the End" />

Under Tarkin's orders, Agent Kallus and the Inquisitor devised a plan to trap the Spectres at the Imperial communications tower. Seeking to counter Imperial propaganda, the Spectres had hijacked the tower complex in order to broadcast a propaganda message to the neighboring systems. Following the rebel assault, Agent Kallus and the Inquisitor arrived with a force of three [[LAAT/le gunship|patrol transports]] and two Imperial Troop Transports and surrounded the complex; trapping the rebels. Kallus personally confronted Kanan outside the communications tower. When Kanan refused to surrender, the Inquisitor engaged the Jedi in a lightsaber duel. Following a brief confrontation, Kanan's rebel comrades managed to escape. Kallus managed to capture Kanan at the cost of one patrol transport.<ref name="Battle to the End" />

At dawn, Agent Kallus handed the captured Jedi Kanan to Grand Moff Tarkin, who praised the Inquisitor for his work. Before Tarkin could interrogate Kanan, Kallus reported that the Spectres had gained control of the tower's transmitter. Kallus listened to Ezra's broadcast and expressed concern at Tarkin's orders to destroy the communications tower. Tarkin's destruction of the Lothal communications tower disrupted offworld communications on Lothal and the neighboring systems; forcing the local Imperial authorities to rely on [[courier droid]]s. Kallus and Tarkin later oversaw the interrogation of Kanan, who per standard Imperial procedure was injected with a truth serum by an [[interrogator droid]]. Despite Kallus's best efforts, Kanan's Jedi training enabled him to resist the interrogation droid's mind probes. Displeased with Kallus' results, Tarkin ordered the Inquisitor to torture Kanan, who still refused to divulge any information on the rebellion. Frustrated by Kanan's resistance, the Imperials transferred the captive Jedi to the [[Mustafar system]].<ref name="Battle to the End" />

Agent Kallus remained on Lothal while Grand Moff Tarkin and the Inquisitor traveled to the Mustafar system with their Jedi captive. However, Kanan's rebel comrades staged a [[Action at Mustafar|mission to rescue]] the Jedi. During that mission, the Inquisitor was killed and the Grand Moff's [[Star Destroyer]] ''[[Sovereign]]'' and several [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE starfighters]] were destroyed by the rebels, who managed to flee into hyperspace with the help of the rebel network. Following the events in the Mustafar system, Kallus was present at the Imperial headquarters' hangar bay when the Grand Moff arrived in a shuttle with [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], the Emperor's Sith apprentice. During the meeting, Kallus expressed concern that the events on Mustafar would cause people to see the Empire as weak and vulnerable. Tarkin disagreed and assured Kallus that Vader would stamp out Spectres and their fledgling rebellion.<ref name="Battle to the End" />

====Enforcing the Siege====
{{Quote|Fear has driven them to ground. There is a refugee camp the rebels have provided aid to in the past.''"<br />"''Yes, Tarkintown they call it. You suspect the rebels are in hiding there?''"<br />"''No. But I want you to burn it. The compassion of the Rebels is a weakness, one we shall exploit.|Vader tells Kallus to burn down Tarkintown to spread fear on Lothal|Star Wars Rebels: The Siege of Lothal}}
[[File:Imperial shuttle explodes.png|thumb|left|250px|Kallus helped engineer the death of Maketh Tua]]
Following the arrival of Darth Vader on Lothal, Agent Kallus met with Minister Tua to discuss her unsuccessful efforts to locate the Spectres. Under Tua's direction the Imperial planetary authorities had increased security and imposed a planetary curfew. However, Minister Tua doubted that such added security measures would succeed since she correctly believed that the rebels had already left the planet. Frustrated, Kallus countered that Grand Moff Tarkin wanted results due to the destruction of his Star Destroyer ''Sovereign''. At that point, Darth Vader interrupted their conversation and suggested that the Imperials lure the rebels back to Lothal and trap them there.<ref name="Siege of Lothal">{{Rebels|Star Wars Rebels: The Siege of Lothal|The Siege of Lothal}}</ref>

When Tua expressed reservations about "punishing" the Lothalian population, Darth Vader responded that she could raise her concerns with Tarkin himself; adding that the Grand Moff had scheduled a meeting with her the following day. When Tua expressed fear that she would meet the same fate as Commandant Aresko and Taskmaster Grint, an unsympathetic Kallus commented that he would "take care of her affairs." Fearing for her life and upset by the Empire's increasingly heavy-handed measures, Tua secretly contacted the Spectres and made arrangements to defect to the rebellion. However, Kallus suspected Tua's treason and sent a probe droid to tail her movements.<ref name="Siege of Lothal" />

The following day, Agent Kallus drove Minister Tua in a [[landspeeder]] to a disembarkation station where an Imperial shuttle was waiting to take her to Grand Moff Tarkin. Kallus was escorted by several stormtroopers to deter any rebel attack. However, the Spectres sprung into action and attempted to rescue Minister Tua. During the ensuing skirmish, Kallus fought against the Jedi Kanan, who had disguised himself as a [[stormtrooper commander]]. Tua ran to the shuttle but was killed in explosion that had been deliberately planted by the Empire to discredit the rebels. Knowing that his probe droid was observing the fray, Kallus feigned anger and accused the rebels of murdering Minister Tua. Despite his efforts, the rebels managed to escape prompting Darth Vader to order Kallus to lay [[Siege of Lothal|siege]] to Lothal.<ref name="Siege of Lothal" />

After the rebels stole a second Imperial shuttle and escaped Capital City, Kallus met Darth Vader again and informed him that the rebels had not yet left Lothal. In order to draw the rebels out, Vader ordered Kallus to destroy Tarkintown, a refugee settlement that the rebels provided assistance to the past. Kallus complied with Vader's orders and sent troops to raze the settlement and to round up its inhabitants, who were imprisoned. Later, the rebels managed to escape Lothal with the assistance of the "galactic entrepreneur" [[Lando Calrissian]]'s droid [[W1-LE]], who helped them to build sensor buoys which confused the Imperial forces tracking them down. However, Vader had allowed the rebels to escape in order to locate the [[Phoenix Cell]], which operated a fleet in deep space. Despite Vader's best efforts, the Spectres managed to escape again.<ref name="Siege of Lothal" />

====The Seelos debacle====
{{Quote|Send a probe to investigate. All leads must be pursued.|Kallus insists upon investigating a tip from Seelos|The Lost Commanders}}
[[File:Relics of the Old Republic thumb.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Kallus' AT-AT walkers closing in on the clones' AT-TE walker]]
After the rebels escaped from Vader, Kallus received a promotion to [[Commander]] and was tasked with helping [[Admiral]] [[Kassius Konstantine]] to locate the rebels. While aboard the bridge of the ''[[Relentless]]'', an officer alerted him that Clone trooper [[CC-3636|Wolffe]] had reported an encounter with Jedi on the desert planet of [[Seelos]]. While Admiral Konstantine expressed skepticism given the clone's history of making delusional distress calls, Kallus insisted that all leads should be pursued and sent a probe droid to investigate.<ref name="The Lost Commanders">{{Rebels|The Lost Commanders}}</ref>

Wolffe's intelligence proved to be accurate and the probe droid managed to locate Kanan and his rebel cell, who were perennial foes of Kallus. Upon arriving above Seelos, Commander Kallus and Admiral Konstantine issued an ultimatum to Wolffe, demanding that he and his fellow clones surrender the rebels or face "total and immediate destruction." Instead, Wolffe's associate, Captain Rex, challenged the agent and mocked the stormtroopers he commanded. Undaunted, Kallus first dispatched a squadron of TIE fighters to the planet. After the rebels destroyed his TIE fighters, Commander Kallus personally led three [[All Terrain Armored Transport|AT-AT walkers]] against the clones' lone [[All Terrain Tactical Enforcer|AT-TE walker]].<ref name="Relics">{{Rebels|Relics of the Old Republic}}</ref>

Despite entering a sandstorm, Kallus ordered the [[Assault on Seelos|assault]] to proceed. Unable to see or detect them, the Imperials were caught off-guard by and one walker was destroyed by a well-placed shot to the neck from Ezra Bridger. Kallus then ordered the remaining walkers to fire where the shot came from, chasing the ancient walker out of the sandstorm just as the rebel ship lifted off. Unaware that Admiral Konstantine had left the [[Seelos system]] to rendezvous with an [[Inquisitorius|Inquisitor]] and was no longer able to provide air support, Kallus ordered his two remaining AT-AT walkers to continue the assault against the "obsolete" Clone troopers.<ref name="Relics" />

However, the clones refused to give up and their old walker, despite taking numerous hits, still had one good fight left in it. To the agent's disbelief, the clones brought their walker right up against Kallus' walker and rammed its legs to overbalance it. Rex then jumped onto the main cannon and openly challenged the walker's crew, deriding them as cowards. Thinking the clone suicidal, Kallus ordered his gunners to "finish him". Before they could do so, the Kallus' AT-AT walker was attacked by the rebel ship ''[[Phantom]]'' and the second AT-AT walker, which had been hijacked by the rebels. Completing the rout, Rex fired a shot from the AT-TE's mass driver cannon right into the neck of Kallus's own walker, crippling it. Kallus and his bridge crew managed to escape the ruined walker on a speeder, though one was left frantically running after it.<ref name="Relics" />

====Tracking the Rebels====
[[File:Legacy Inquisitors.png|thumb|left|275px|Kallus joined forces with the Fifth Brother and Seventh Sister to hunt down the Spectres]]
Following the events on Seelos, Kallus and Konstantine continued serving aboard the ''Relentless'' with the Fifth Brother. On one occasion, a member of the crew detected a power surge aboard an abandoned Republic medical station. This time both Kallus and Konstantine expressed skepticism of this being anything of note, but the Fifth Brother disagreed and investigated the situation personally. There, the Fifth Brother and another Inquisitor known as the [[Seventh Sister]] encountered the rebels Ezra, Sabine, Chopper, and Zeb and engaged them in a [[Skirmish aboard a Republic medical station|skirmish]]. Despite the best efforts to the two Inquisitors, the four rebels managed to escape and warn their rebel comrades about the existence of more Inquisitors.<ref name="Always Two There Are">{{Rebels|Always Two There Are}}</ref>

Kallus later oversaw a blockade surrounding the planet [[Ibaar]], rightfully suspecting the rebels would attempt to aid the overworked population. His fleet successfully repelled an attack by Phoenix Squadron, destroying a [[CR90 corvette]] and even killing the [[Phoenix Leader (Ibaar)|Phoenix Leader]] in the process. The rebels later retaliated with a [[Prototype B6|prototype Bladewing starfighter]] which broke the blockade and allowed their supplies to make it onto the surface. The sheer power of the single fighter left Kallus shocked in disbelief.<ref name="Wings of the Master">{{Rebels|Wings of the Master}}</ref>

Shortly after the Ibaar incident, [[Swain]], a female officer who been training under Kallus' wing, had an epiphany. Realizing that she did not want to be part of an organization that bullied ordinary citizens, she chose to defect along with her fellow officer [[Cogon]], and the two stole a ''Lambda''-class T-4a shuttle. Kallus, however, traced the shuttle's signal. Aboard the ''Relentless'', he followed his former protégée to the planet [[Thrad]], from where she and her accomplice intended to travel to [[Klonoid]], where they would joined a local [[Rebel cell (Klonoid)|rebel cell]]. The Imperial agent chased Swain and Cogon in the streets, but the defectors managed to corner him in an alley. Deprived of his bo-rifle, Kallus appeared to be at Swain's mercy. However, two stormtroopers made a timely arrival and shot Cogon in the back. The agent and his former protégée briefly exchanged blows, until Kallus was, once again, pinned to the ground, seemingly defenseless. But Kallus, much to Swain's surprise, retrieved a backup weapon from under his cuirass and stunned her. He then contacted Admiral Konstantine, ordering him to destroy a suspicious ship trying to leave the planet&mdash;the very ship Swain and Cogon were supposed to board. Finally, the agent had Swain transported aboard Konstantine's Star Destroyer for interrogation, and reported his success to Lord Darth Vader.<ref name="NoSymp">{{SWRMCite|14|No Sympathy}}</ref>

Kallus later received a transmission from Admiral [[Brom Titus]], who boasted that he had captured the rebels [[Jun Sato]] and Ezra Bridger. Kallus promised to rendezvous with Titus' prototype [[Imperial Interdictor]] and advised him to keep Bridger under triple guard, but Titus dismissed his warnings. When Kallus arrived, he found the Interdictor destroyed, the rebels having fled and a humiliated Titus in an escape pod, to Kallus' smug delight.<ref name="Stealth Strike">{{Rebels|Stealth Strike}}</ref>

After the Inquisitor known as the Seventh Sister discovered a rebel presence on the planet Garel, Agent Kallus ordered Admiral Konstantine to deploy the Imperial fleet from Lothal to Garel. He convinced the Seventh Sister and the Fifth Brother to join forces to capture the Phoenix Squadron, which included the Spectres, his perennial foes. Kallus also led the ground assault and attempted to apprehend the Spectres. However, Ezra Bridger used the Force to hurl Kallus against a wall, knocking him out. After the Spectres escaped, Kallus contacted Admiral Konstantine for information on the position of the rebel fleet. Konstantine reported that he did not know since the rebels had already escaped into hyperspace.<ref name="Legacy">{{Rebels|Legacy (episode)|Legacy}}</ref>

Agent Kallus and Admiral Konstantine later commanded an [[Arquitens-class command cruiser|''Arquitens''-class command cruiser]] which attempted to capture the ''Ghost'' above the planet [[Nixus]]. Earlier, the crew of the ''Ghost'' had rescued two Lasat [[refugee]]s named [[Gron]] and [[Chava|Chava the Wise]], who were looking for the legendary Lasat homeworld of [[Lira San]]. Despite their best efforts, the ''Ghost'' managed to jump into hyperspace before the Imperials could trap it. However, the Imperials had managed to capture the [[Weequay]] [[pirate]] [[Hondo Ohnaka]], who had first alerted the crew of the ''Ghost'' to the Lasat refugees. Ohnnaka was forced to work for the Imperials and managed to locate the ''Ghost'' due to a tracker planted in his communications device.<ref name="Legends of the Lasat">{{Rebels|Legends of the Lasat}}</ref>

Kallus' Imperial light cruiser tracked the ''Ghost'' to an imploded [[star cluster]] in [[Wild Space]]. Upon exiting hyperspace, Kallus gave the rebels one minute to surrender before he destroyed their starship. Realizing that Kallus was the [[Prophecy of the Three|prophesied]] "warrior" from Lasat legend, Zeb used his [[bo-rifle]] to guide the ''Ghost'' through the unstable star cluster. When the rebels refused to heed his ultimatum, Kallus sent two TIE fighters after the ''Ghost'' but they were ripped apart by the gravitational forces of the star cluster. Kallus' light cruiser then opened fire on the ''Ghost'' but each shot missed. Kallus was forced to withdraw his cruiser after it began sustaining damage from the gravity field. While Kallus hoped that the ''Ghost'' would be destroyed, he was disappointed when the rebel freighter managed to enter the star cluster safely.<ref name="Legends of the Lasat" />

====An unlikely alliance====
[[File:The Honorable Ones Zeb Kallus.png|right|thumb|275px|Kallus developed an unlikely friendship with Zeb]]
Kallus' next move was to set a trap for the crew of the ''Ghost'' at an [[ICM-092792|Imperial construction module]] over the desert planet of [[Geonosis]]. Despite his success in luring the rebels into the trap, his men failed to capture them and the rebels managed to escape into space. During the skirmish, Kallus engaged the Lasat in single combat. When Zeb attempted to flee in an [[escape pod]], Kallus pursued him into the pod and attempted to subdue him. The escape attempt resulted in Kallus breaking his leg and the pod crashing onto the frozen Geonosian moon of [[Bahryn]].<ref name="The Honorable Ones" />

Zeb spared Kallus, not wishing to defeat his rival in an unfair fight. The two enemies were forced to cooperate to avoid freezing to death and being killed by the [[bonzami]], ferocious predators that inhabited the moon. When the creatures attacked and Kallus regained his weapon, he passed up the chance to kill Zeb and helped him fend off the predators. After saving one another, the two adversaries opened up to one another and formed an unlikely bond. After their heat source failed, Zeb located a small meteorite still glowing and emanating heat which he gave to Kallus. When the bonzami attacked them again, they managed to escape the underground cavern to the surface following a struggle. Here Kallus had the opportunity to shoot Zeb but opted to save him from the bonzami instead.<ref name="The Honorable Ones" />

The following morning, the crew of the ''Ghost'' returned for Zeb, after picking up his [[Escape pod transponder|transponder]]. Zeb invited Kallus to come along claiming he would be treated fairly. However, Kallus declined and opted to wait for the Imperials. After the rebels had departed, Kallus was picked up by a passing independent trader, as the Empire had exhausted its allocated time and resources for finding him. After finally returning to the Imperial fleet, Kallus crossed paths with Admiral Konstantine who barely acknowledged him much to Kallus' dismay after witnessing the camaraderie Zeb had shown him. After limping back to his quarters, he placed the meteorite Zeb had given him on a shelf before reflecting on his sobering experience with his enemy, now privately doubting the Empire.<ref name="The Honorable Ones" />

====Disillusionment====
[[File:Kallus @ Skystrike Academy.jpeg|left|250px|thumb|Kallus helping Sabine and the defecting cadets to escape]]
Following his encounter with Zeb, Kallus's doubts began to grow. They eventually pushed him to defect to the rebellion. He worked as a spy under the pseudonym ''[[Fulcrum (title)|Fulcrum]]'' supplying secret information to the rebellion through broadcasted messages.<ref name="Antilles Extraction">{{Rebels|The Antilles Extraction}}</ref>

In [[2 BBY]],<ref name="Hidalgo Tweet">{{Twitter|pablohidalgo|status/771832098231504896|[[Pablo Hidalgo]]|quote=six months pass between the S2 finale and the S3 premiere. We're about 2 years from Ep4|noimage=}}</ref> Kallus was still hunting the rebels, along with Governor Pryce, Admiral Konstantine and Grand Moff Tarkin. Pryce then revealed that [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]] and his [[Seventh Fleet]] would be leading their efforts against the rebels. After hearing that Thrawn was recently promoted for his efforts in the [[Batonn insurgency|Battle]] of [[Batonn]], Kallus commented that the civilian casualties were higher than the insurgent casualties. In response to this, Governor Pryce told him that there were no longer rebels in the [[Batonn sector]]. Later, Kallus accompanied Pryce and Konstantine to [[Yarma]] where the Phoenix rebels had [[Mission to Reklam Station|raided]] the Imperial floating junkyard [[Reklam Station]]. Kallus was present when Thrawn ordered Pryce and Konstantine to allow the rebels to escape with their "meager reward" of five stolen [[BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber|Y-wing starfighters]].<ref name="Steps">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Steps Into Shadow]]''</ref>

Later on, Kallus informed the rebels that there were cadets at the Imperial Skystrike Academy who wanted to defect to the rebellion. He then accompanied Governor Pryce to the Skystrike Academy. Pryce had arrived after hearing rumors of several cadets attempting to defect and had Captain [[Vult Skerris]] perform a combat simulator in space to lure out the defectors. Her plan worked, and the Imperials killed one of the defectors and captured the other three. In an interrogation room, Kallus noticed Sabine and when she revealed her identity to save the other two cadets, Pryce had Kallus take the other two cadets, Hobbie and Wedge, to another cell. Sabine commented to Kallus "looks like they have found someone who can do your job." before Kallus took the two cadets into their cell.<ref name="Antilles Extraction" />

When Sabine broke free from Pryce's grasp and fled with Hobbie and Wedge, the Imperials trapped them with blast doors. Kallus suddenly appeared and opened one of the doors and advised them how to escape. He then told Sabine to send his regards to Garazeb Orrelios, and that they "were even now". Kallus then closed the blast door after the three left and hid himself until the alarm was off.<ref name="Antilles Extraction" />

Later, Agent Kallus accompanied Governor Pryce aboard the bridge of a Star Destroyer. Kallus complimented the Governor for her plan to lure the Spectres into a trap at a fuel depot. However, Pryce responded that her plan would only succeed if she captured the rebels. Kallus was present when Pryce dispatched Imperial forces to investigate a distress signal originating from [[Agamar]].<ref name="The Last Battle">{{Rebels|The Last Battle}}</ref>

====Under Thrawn====
[[File:Thrawn studying the Lothal rebels.jpeg|right|250px|thumb|Kallus and Lieutenant Lyste in Thrawn's office]]
Following his encounter with Sabine at the Skystrike Academy, Kallus learned that the Empire was developing a new weapon at the [[Imperial Armory Complex]], he then contacted the Phoenix Squadron, who were planning to attack the factory. Due to the high rate of malfunctioning vehicles produced by the Lothal Imperial factory, the [[Imperial High Command]] dispatched Grand Admiral Thrawn to restore order and to investigate the factory for saboteurs. Indeed, a [[Lothal resistance|rebel cell]] led by former Governor [[Ryder Azadi]] had been sabotaging the vehicles.<ref name="An Inside Man">{{Rebels|An Inside Man}}</ref>

With Governor Pryce and Lieutenant [[Yogar Lyste]], Agent Kallus summoned the factory workers for an assembly. Thrawn then gave a speech berating the workers for their shoddy craftsmanship. He then forced the former farmer [[Morad Sumar]], a member of Azadi's cell, to demonstrate a [[614-AvA speeder bike]]. Due to a faulty engine, the bike exploded during the test demonstration, killing Sumar. Kallus was horrified by Thrawn's action but Governor Pryce smirked. Thrawn then ordered his Imperial subordinates to lock down the factory and to question the workers. However, the rebel infiltrators Ezra, Kanan, and Chopper managed to escape the screening and headed to Section A2.<ref name="An Inside Man" />

While Thrawn and Governor Pryce discussed the secrets hidden inside the factory's Section A2, Kallus asked his superiors for more information on the project so that he could question the workers more effectively. Pryce responded that all that Kallus needed to know was that the Grand Admiral had a [[TIE/D Defender|new fighter initiative]]. When Kallus expressed skepticism about the prospects of one fighter changing the war, Thrawn replied that victory and defeat were determined by the smallest details. Kallus was present when Thrawn ordered another worker to demonstrate an AT-DP walker. At Thrawn's command, Kallus released the walker from its station. When the walker collapsed, Thrawn gestured for his men to arrest the worker.<ref name="An Inside Man" />

Later, Kallus and Lieutenant Lyste visited [[Thrawn's Office]], which contained several objects relating to the [[Spectres]]. When Thrawn asked the two officers about one of Sabine's graffiti art pieces, Lyste remarked that it was merely a section of a retaining wall. By contrast, the more perceptive Kallus recognized the drawing as a [[starbird]], a creature of light that had been adopted as a symbol of the Phoenix Squadron. Kallus interpreted the starbird as a symbol of the rebel's commitment to victory. Thrawn agreed and theorized that the Spectres had a special connection to Lothal.<ref name="An Inside Man" />

[[File:Kanan and Ezra meet Kallus.jpeg|left|250px|thumb|Kallus helps Kanan and Ezra to escape the Imperial factory]]
When Thrawn asks if they had found any more subversives, Lyste informed the Admiral that two workers had disappeared following Thrawn's speech but that they had left behind their uniforms. Kallus suggested issuing an alert but Thrawn advised against it since he believed that the rebels were already inside the factory and had found new disguises. When Kallus asked Thrawn whether he thought that the rebels were more than saboteurs, the Admiral responded that the rebels were after the contents of Section A2 and sent Kallus and Lyste to secure it.<ref name="An Inside Man" />

Spotting Ezra and Kanan in their stormtrooper disguises with their droid, Kallus ushered them into a [[turbolift]] under the pretext of ordering them to secure a perimeter. Inside the lift, Kallus introduced himself to the rebels, who fought him. However, Kallus managed to convince them that he was a friend by identifying himself as Fulcrum and quoting the code phrase "by the light of Lothal's moons." Kallus also reminded the two that he had befriended Zeb on Bahryn and helped Sabine to escape. While Chopper believed Kallus, Ezra and Kanan were slower to trust their former adversary.<ref name="An Inside Man" />

Nevertheless, Kanan convinced Kallus to help them send a signal to his local contact Ryder Azadi. Kallus led the rebels into a communications station and pretended to fight them. The rebels managed to use their blasters and lightsabers to [[stun]] the stormtroopers and officer at the station. Kallus then allowed Chopper to upload Kanan's comlink from the station's port. After the rebels had contacted Ryder, Kallus told them to head to the east gate where they would find an AT-DP walker in the hangar. To make it appear that Kallus had put up a fight, Ezra hurled the ISB agent against the glass monitor. While hurt by the shattered glass, Kallus was pleased that he had helped his new allies escape.<ref name="An Inside Man" />

Due to Kallus' help, Ezra, Kanan, and Chopper managed to escape the factory on the AT-DP walker and link up with Ryder's cell. They also managed to send the stolen plans to the Phoenix Squadron, which discovered that Thrawn was developing a new starfighter. Ezra and Kanan credited Kallus with helping them escape the factory. While Hera and Sabine believed that Kallus could not be trusted yet, Zeb vouched for his former adversary and remarked that he must have accidentally recruited him.<ref name="An Inside Man" />

Later, Thrawn questioned Kallus about his encounter with the rebels. Having analysed the rebels' escape pattern, Thrawn suspected that the rebels had inside help from a mole. Instead of questioning Imperial personnel, Thrawn decided to set a trap for the mole. Feigning loyalty to the Empire, Kallus commended Thrawn for his "flawless" strategy.<ref name="An Inside Man" />

====Sabotage====
[[File:Kallus Warhead.jpeg|right|250px|thumb|Kallus witnesses EXD-9's explosion destroying a Star Destroyer]]
Agent Kallus was later privy to Grand Admiral Thrawn's plan to dispatch [[E-XD infiltrator droid]]s across the [[Outer Rim Territories]] to search for rebel bases. While stationed aboard a Star Destroyer, Kallus was informed by another officer that they had lost contact with [[EXD-9]]. Unable to track down the droid's location, the officer suggested alerting Imperial High Command. Kallus advised him not to under the pretext that chasing down every comm failure would be a waste of time. Instead, he advised the officer to wait until the next cycle.<ref name="Warhead">{{Rebels|Warhead (episode)|Warhead}}</ref>

Using his Fulcrum pseudonym, Kallus sent a recorded transmission to Chopper Base warning the rebels that the Empire was dispatching E-XD infiltrator droids across the galaxy. He also added that the Empire had lost contact with one and would come searching for it soon. Fulcrum's warning alerted Kallus' rebel friend Zeb, who realized that the "stray" protocol droid he found was an infiltrator droid. Working with Chopper and the [[RA-7 protocol droid]] [[AP-5]], Zeb overpowered the infiltrator droid. The three rebels then reprogrammed EXD-9 into an improvised bomb which they used to destroy a Star Destroyer.<ref name="Warhead" />

Kallus was on the bridge of another Star Destroyer when he witnessed the other ship go up in flames. Feigning shock and anger, he asked what happened. An officer informed him that one of their infiltrator droid's proton warheads had gone off prematurely. Kallus secretly smiled and later sent a transmission to Chopper Base praising the rebels for their ingenious plan to neutralize the infiltrator droid. Later, he visited Thrawn and reported that the rebels had reprogrammed an infiltrator droid into an improvised bomb. Both men regarded the rebel plan as ingenious. When Kallus noticed that Thrawn was in good spirits despite the setback, the Grand Admiral replied that he had narrowed down his search from thousands of systems to the 94 systems that he had sent infiltrator droids to.<ref name="Warhead" />

====Spy games====
[[File:Kallus and Lyste meet Yularen.jpeg|left|250px|thumb|Agent Kallus, Lieutenant Lyste, and Colonel Yularen]]
Kallus' Fulcrum transmissions eventually attracted the scrutiny of Grand Admiral Thrawn, who launched an investigation of the [[Sector Command (Galactic Empire)|Sector Command]] staff in the [[Lothal sector]]. The Spectres rebel cell learned that Thrawn was on to Kallus' work as a double agent and decided to rescue Kallus. As part of the plan, Ezra, Chopper and AP-5 stole a [[Star Commuter 2000]] shuttle from Lothal's [[Capital City spaceport]]. They then allowed themselves to be captured by Kallus' Imperial light cruiser, which was captained by Lieutenant Yogar Lyste.<ref name="TIE" />

Kallus was awakened from his sleep when Lieutenant Lyste brought the ship into battle-station mode to intercept the stolen shuttle. Upon entering the light cruiser's bridge, Kallus was briefed by Lyste about the shuttle heist. After Lyste's light cruiser trapped the stolen shuttle with its [[tractor beam projector]], Kallus headed to the landing bay to interrogate the shuttle thief, who turned out to be the rebel Ezra Bridger. Bridger was disguised as a bounty hunter and accompanied by Chopper and AP-5, who claimed to be unwilling passengers aboard the stolen shuttle.<ref name="TIE" />

Kallus met with Ezra in the light cruiser's brig and learned about Thrawn's investigation for Fulcrum's true identity and the rebel extraction mission. Before they could make their next move, Lieutenant Lyste entered the brig to inform Kallus that Grand Admiral Thrawn had summoned both of them for a meeting aboard his [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|Imperial Star Destroyer]] ''[[Chimaera]]''. To protect Ezra, Kallus claimed that the prisoner was a [[bounty hunter]] from Lothal. Seeking to curry favor with Thrawn and redeem his image after the [[Mission on Lothal|incident]] with [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Organa]], Lyste arranged for Ezra to be brought aboard Thrawn's ship. Kallus and Lyste then traveled to the ''Chimaera'' aboard the [[Sentinel-class landing craft|''Sentinel''-class landing craft]] [[Shuttle TYA77]].<ref name="TIE" />

Once aboard the ''Chimaera'', Kallus and Lyste headed to Thrawn's Office. Meanwhile, the droids searched for a port to download a new set of clearance codes for the rescue team members Kanan and the former [[Clone Captain]] [[Rex]]. Ezra was thrown into the ''Chimaera''{{'s}} detention block. At Thrawn's Office, Kallus and Lyste were met by Thrawn, Konstantine, and Kallus' former ISB instructor Wullf Yularen. During the meeting, Kallus learned about Thrawn's investigation into Fulcrum and how he was close to discovering the Phoenix Squadron's [[Chopper Base|base]] on the planet [[Atollon]]. Following the meeting, Kallus spent time with his former instructor and took the opportunity to sow disinformation.<ref name="TIE" />

Knowing that Thrawn was close to uncovering his identity and feeling he could do more good for the Rebel Network by remaining undercover, Kallus decided to implicate Lyste as Fulcrum. Taking advantage of Lyste's woeful inexperience and naivete, he tricked Lyste into believing that Governor Pryce was Fulcrum and told him to spy on her. Kallus also stole Lyste's [[code cylinder]]. After finding AP-5 and Chopper, Kallus freed Ezra from his cell and told him about Thrawn's search for the rebel base. Kallus tried to convince Ezra to give him the location of the rebel base so that he could delete it from Thrawn's database. Not fully trusting Kallus, Ezra insisted that Kallus wait until they had extracted him from the ''Chimaera''. AP-5 then managed to convince Ezra to support Kallus' plan by pointing out that he could get a new set of clearance code's from Thrawn's office.<ref name="TIE" />

After tricking Lyste into tailing Pryce, Kallus obtained an Imperial uniform for Ezra. The two then infiltrated Thrawn's office with Ezra using a Jedi [[mind trick]] to convince the stormtrooper sentry that he was Lieutenant Lyste. Once inside, Kallus instructed Chopper to delete Atollon and to add another planet. Before they could leave, Thrawn returned to his office. Kallus and his rebel allies managed to hide in the dark corners of the officer. To distract Thrawn, Kallus then reprogrammed the Grand Admiral's [[Imperial sentry droid]]s to attack Thrawn, thus implicating Lyste.<ref name="TIE" />

Kallus and his rebel companions then headed back to the ''Chimaera''{{'s}} [[hangar]] bay to rendezvous with Kanan and Rex's shuttle. However, Thrawn had learned about the rebel infiltrators and had sent Governor Pryce and Colonel Yularen with stormtroopers to deal with the second set of intruders. Believing that Pryce was Fulcrum, Lieutenant Lyste stunned her. Kallus then tackled Lyste and knocked him to the ground. At that point, Kallus changed his mind and told his rebel friends he would stay behind in order to continue supplying them with intelligence. When Yularen finally arrived, Kallus publicly accused Lyste of being Fulcrum.<ref name="TIE" />

Lyste tried to protest his innocence but Kallus remained impassive. Later, Kallus attended a meeting with Pryce, Yularen, and Thrawn. Yularen claimed that Lyste's cylinder code implicated him as Fulcrum. Pryce bought Kallus' explanation while the ISB agent apologized to Thrawn for failing to stop Lyste's purported assassination attempt. Thrawn publicly praised Kallus for his services and dismissed him and Pryce. In private however, Thrawn informed Yularen that Kallus was the real Fulcrum. Instead of arresting him, Thrawn decided to use Kallus to lead them to the rebel base.<ref name="TIE" />

===Joining the rebellion===
====Discovery====
[[File:Thrawn Vs. Kallus.jpeg|right|thumb|275px|Kallus fighting Thrawn following his exposure as "Fulcrum"]]
Sometime after Lyste was apprehended, Kallus used a reprogrammed [[MSE-6 series repair droid|mouse droid]] to spy on a conversation between Grand Admiral Thrawn, Grand Moff Tarkin, Governor Pryce, and Admiral Konstantine. While eavesdropping on their conversation, Kallus learned that Thrawn was aware that the Phoenix Squadron and [[General]] [[Jan Dodonna]]'s [[Massassi Group]] were planning an attack on the TIE Defender factories on Lothal. Kallus returned to Ezra's [[LothalNet comm tower E-272|former home]] and attempted to warn the rebels that Thrawn was aware of their plans. However, he discovered his [[transmitter]]'s signal was being jammed and Kallus was only able to transmit a fragment of his message.<ref name="Zero Hour" />

Kallus was startled by the phrase "by the light of Lothal's moons" and found Thrawn standing behind him, who knew that he was the mole since Lyste's arrest. Kallus attempted to fight Thrawn but was outmatched and captured by Thrawn's [[Death trooper]]s. Thrawn used the trajectories of General Dodonna's fleet and Kallus' Fulcrum signals to identify the location of Chopper Base on the planet Atollon. When Kallus insisted there was no planet at that location, Thrawn derided Kallus for his purported lack of appreciation for art. He explained that though the Atollon system is missing from Imperial charts, it is represented in the art of the ancient people of the sector.<ref name="Zero Hour" />

Kallus was later brought onto the bridge of the ''Chimaera'' and forced to watch the [[Battle of Atollon|battle]] in captivity, in the presence of Thrawn and Governor Pryce. After Thrawn ordered Admiral Konstantine to keep his [[interdictor vessel]] in formation with the fleet, Kallus mocked Thrawn for vying for personal glory. However, the Grand Admiral responded that he was only interested in yielding results for his Emperor. Kallus and his captors later watched as Commande] Jun Sato's [[command ship]] ''[[Phoenix Nest]]'' collide with Konstantine's interdictor cruiser, destroying both ships. Earlier, Konstantine had disregarded Thrawn's orders to remain in the center of the formation and had tried to gain personal glory by intercepting Commander Sato's ship.<ref name="Zero Hour" />

Before Thrawn debarked for ground assault, Kallus mockingly warned him that he had been in Thrawn's position before and been defeated by the rebels. However, the Grand Admiral responded that he was different. Thrawn's forces succeeded in storming Chopper Base but the Grand Admiral was denied full victory when a mysterious Force entity called [[Bendu]] attacked and devastated the base; giving the rebels a window to escape. Kallus remained aboard the bridge of the ''Chimaera'' when Ezra and Sabine's [[Clan Wren]] reinforcements launched a rear attack on the [[Seventh Fleet]]'s last remaining interdictor cruiser.<ref name="Zero Hour" />

After the rebels managed to destroy the last remaining interdictor cruiser, Kallus smirked and told Pryce that she had "made a mess of Thrawn's fleet". Enraged, Pryce ordered two stormtroopers to throw him out of the ship through an [[airlock]]. Owing to his ISB combat training, Kallus easily overpowered his captors and made his way to an escape pod and ejected from the Star Destroyer. After contacting Hera he was picked up by the ''Ghost''. Once aboard, Kallus thanked Jarrus for taking him in and was in turn thanked by Jarrus for risking everything for the Rebellion.<ref name="Zero Hour" />

====Rebel comrade====
{{Quote|A reunion! How nice, but as Commander Bridger suggests, it's time to get to work.|Kallus, to the reuniting Spectures|In the Name of the Rebellion}}
Some time later, as a captain of the Rebel Alliance, Kallus served in the Alliance's Massassi Group, and coordinated with the Spectres. After Hera's squadron of [[Y-wing starfighter|Y-wings]] returned to [[Yavin 4]] after a mission, Kallus interrupted the Spectres' reunion to inform them that the rebel leader [[Mon Mothma]] had requested an audience with them. During the meeting, the rebels discussed information about the Empire's new relay station on [[Jalindi]] which had been provided by the [[Partisans]]' leader Saw Gerrera. Kallus expressed disapproval of Saw's methods of gaining information but convinced the Alliance leadership to authorize a [[Mission to Jalindi|mission]] to plant a spike on the Jalindi relay.<ref name="In the Name of the Rebellion" />

Later, Kallus and Rex manned the [[VCX-100 light freighter]] ''[[Ghost]]'' while the Spectres undertook a [[Theft of the TIE Defender Elite|mission]] to Lothal to steal a TIE/D Defender. The rebels' plan was to rendezvous with the smuggler Cikatro Vizagos ship ''[[Broken Horn]]'' in order to infiltrate Lothal. Kallus warned that Vizago could not be trusted but Ezra disagreed. Before the Spectres left, Hera placed the former Clone Captain Rex in command of the ''Ghost''. Kallus initially thought that Hera was referring to him and pointed out that he had commanded Star Destroyers in the past. Rex corrected him and the former Imperial vacated the pilot's seat for Rex.<ref name="The Occupation">{{Rebels|The Occupation}}</ref>

====Mustering allies====
[[File:Hera mustering allies.jpeg|thumb|Kallus at Joopa Base|left|275x275px]]
Following the Spectres' [[Mission to the Lothal Jedi Temple|mission]] to the [[Lothal Jedi Temple]], Kallus accompanied Hera and Rex aboard the ''Ghost'' to the planet Seelos; which was the home of Rex's fellow Clone veterans [[CC-5576-39|Gregor]] and Wolffe aboard [[Joopa Base]]. At Gregor and Wolffe's modified AT-AT walker "[[Joopa Base]]", the rebels also met the Weequay pirate Hondo Ohnaka, his [[Ugnaught]] companion [[Melch]], and the [[Mandalorian]] bounty hunter [[Ketsu Onyo]]; former friends of Ezra. After briefing them, these allies agreed to help Ezra [[Liberation of Lothal|liberate]] his homeworld of Lothal.<ref name="A Fool's Hope">{{Rebels|A Fool's Hope}}</ref>

While traveling back to Lothal, the rebels and their allies waited aboard the ''Ghost'' in hyperspace to latch on to an [[Class four container transport|Imperial container transport]] at the suggestion of Hondo. Though Kallus and Rex were skeptical, Hondo's plan worked and the rebels were able to infiltrate Lothal by latching onto a container transport. Upon landing, Kallus along with Rex, Gregor, and Wolffe helped Ezra and Ryder's forces to defeat Governor Pryce's forces at the [[Lothal cliff dwelling]]. The rebels also succeeded in capturing Pryce, who was essential to Ezra's liberation plan.<ref name="A Fool's Hope" />

====Liberating Lothal====
Prior to the assault on the Dome, the center of Imperial power on Lothal, Kallus and Ryder led out the captive Pryce. When Pryce denounced Kallus as a [[treason|traitor]], he countered that the day that he betrayed the Empire was the day he stopped betraying himself. With the help of the [[White Loth-wolf]], Ezra managed to force an unwilling Pryce to help them gain entry to the Dome.<ref name="Family&Farewell">{{Rebels|Family Reunion – and Farewell}}</ref>

[[File:Lothal rebels and Spectres inside the Dome.jpeg|thumb|right|Kallus & fellow rebels inside Imperial dome command center.|275x275px]]
The rebels then traveled in two patrol transports to the Dome. For the mission, Kallus posed as an [[Imperial Navy Trooper]] and kept an eye on Pryce, who complied with all of the rebels' instructions, and would know if Pryce gave them the wrong codes. Due to Pryce's cooperation, the rebels managed to fight their way into the Dome and capture the command center. Working with Ezra and Ryder, Kallus helped to issue a faux [[Protocol 13]] to recall the entire Imperial garrison on Lothal to the Dome.<ref name="Family&Farewell" />

Though their plan worked, they were unable to launch the Dome into space due to the return of Grand Admiral Thrawn aboard the ''Chimaera''. Thrawn had his assassin Rukh disable the power terminals powering the Dome's [[deflector shield generator]], allowing him to bombard Capital City. After Ezra left to confront Thrawn, Kallus took part in a two-pronged attack to reactive the generators. He, Zeb, and Gregor were part of Team B, which was tasked with reactivating the southern power terminal.<ref name="Family&Farewell" />

Despite strong resistance, Kallus and his team managed to make it to the southern power terminal. There, they were attacked by Rukh and several Death troopers. While Zeb fought with Rukh, Kallus and Gregor took on the Death troopers. During the struggle, Gregor was shot in the chest and mortally wounded. Kallus attended to the fallen Clone trooper, who told him to get the shields back up. At Zeb's instruction, Kallus activated the power terminal, with the resulting surge killing the trapped Rukh.<ref name="Family&Farewell" />

After this Ezra had the young rebel [[Mart Mattin]] summon a pod of [[Purrgil]]. The Purrgil destroyed the Imperial blockade and attached to the ''Chimaera'', which caused the ship, Thrawn, its crew, and Ezra to disappear into hyperspace. With the elimination of Thrawn, the rebels competed their task of launching and destroying the Imperial dome. Kallus escaped with his fellow rebels aboard the ''Ghost'' before the "Dome" exploded.<ref name="Family&Farewell" />

As the ''Ghost'' flew over the cheering crowds, Kallus observed that the people of Lothal were now fully with the rebellion. General Syndulla responded that if the Empire wanted a fight, the rebels would be ready. Despite the rebels' fears, the Empire never returned to Lothal.<ref name="Family&Farewell" />

====Post-War====
{{Quote|After the war, Zeb took Kallus along the secret hyperspace path to the planet Lira San. It was then that Kallus realized he hadn't destroyed the Lasat people, and that they were thriving on this new world. A world where he was welcomed as one of them.|Sabine Wren on Alexsandr Kallus's fate|Family Reunion – and Farewell}}
After the [[Galactic Civil War]], Zeb brought Kallus to the planet Lira San, revealing to the former ISB agent that the Lasat species had not only survived the Empire's wrath, but were thriving. The Lasat people, having forgiven Kallus, welcomed him as one of their own.<ref name="Family&Farewell" />

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|The day I betrayed your Empire, Governor, was the day I finally stopped betraying myself.|Alexsandr Kallus to Arihnda Pryce|Family Reunion – and Farewell}}
As an Agent of the Imperial Security Bureau, Kallus was a firm believer in the Imperial cause<ref name="Meet Kallus">{{SW|url=video/star-wars-rebels-meet-agent-kallus-imperial-enforcer|text=Star Wars Rebels: Meet Agent Kallus, Imperial Enforcer}}</ref> and held a fierce loyalty towards the Emperor. Kallus hated disorder and rebellious activity, and made it his life's work to ensure stability within the Empire. He had a sense of superiority over others, which inflated his disdain of lawlessness in the Outer Rim Territories.<ref name="Visual Guide" /> Through his position as an ISB Agent, Kallus hoped to achieve greater prominence within the Empire. Any time he could defeat rebel insurgents, he would consider it a prize that he achieved for the Empire, a prize that could help him move onto something bigger.<ref name="Meet Kallus" /> Even so, he had passed up several offers at promotion in order to remain on the front lines with the Imperial Security Bureau.<ref name="everything">''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know]]''</ref>

Kallus, a skilled fighter, did not command soldiers from afar, but rather fought alongside them on the front lines, including against the crew of the ''Ghost''.<ref name="Meet Kallus" /> Kallus showed an eagerness to fight Orrelios on Lothal in bo-rifle combat and appeared to have taken pride in his role in the destruction of the Lasat species, though his actual involvement in it would later prove to be minimal.<ref name="Droids in Distress" /> Kallus saw his actions as necessary in order to do his job and ensure stability and efficiency within the Empire.<ref name="Meet Kallus" /> Additionally, Kallus demonstrated his ruthlessness once by kicking one of his men into a chasm to his death for asking an innocent question.<ref name="Spark" /> When he conspired with Vader to lure Maketh Tua to her death, he exhibited a twisted zeal in carrying out her execution. <ref name="Siege of Lothal" />

Beneath his bravado, Kallus was not as cold and cruel as he appeared. He was genuinely disturbed by the sudden and brutal execution of Cumberlayne Aresko and Myles Grint on the orders of Grand Moff Tarkin, whom he had seen as loyal fellow imperials.<ref name="Call to Action">{{Rebels|Call to Action}}</ref> Despite being a hardened soldier who rarely showed any weakness, he revealed a more vulnerable side when he was forced to cooperate with Zeb to survive; revealing his tough persona to be little more than a mask to hide how sad, confused, and lost he felt at heart, haunted by his past. His conversations with Zeb revealed that he held a somewhat rose-tinted view of the Empire, firmly believing that Zeb would receive a fair trial if he were to turn himself in and cooperate.<ref name="The Honorable Ones" /> Kallus was also able to repay his debt to Zeb by letting his friend Sabine Wren and two defecting pilots to escape.<ref name="Antilles Extraction" />

Kallus also seemingly chose to remain ignorant of at least some of the Empire's atrocities, stating that he "never asked questions" regarding the missing population of Geonosis and arguing against the notion that the Empire was responsible. He revealed that he kept his bo-rifle not as a trophy but out of respect for the Lasat he had defeated, who presented him his weapon as a gift for defeating him in line with the Lasat tradition. He gained a respect for Zeb and apologized for his role in the Imperial pacification of Lasan, claiming he hadn't intended it to be a massacre. In light of the unique bond he formed with his enemy, he was saddened by the cold and indifferent reception he received from his own comrades upon his return.<ref name="The Honorable Ones" /> His loyalty was tested further when one of Grand Admiral Thrawn's campaigns caused a high number of civilian casualties, for which he expressed his concerns to the Grand Admiral.<ref name="Steps" />

[[File:Agent Kallus AWH.png|left|thumb|250px|Agent Kallus]]
Kallus' growing disillusionment with the Empire and friendship with Zeb later led him to secretly aid Sabine in her operation to extract defecting Imperial cadets Wedge and Hobbie from the Skystrike academy. He gave Sabine Wren and the cadets instructions on which levels to avoid and told Wren that he and Zeb were now even. Kallus' advice proved sincere and Sabine and the cadets were able to escape.<ref name="Antilles Extraction" /> Like Minister Maketh Tua, Kallus's growing disillusionment with brutish ways of the Empire led him to begin aiding the rebels. Kallus' sympathy for the rebellion led him to leak information about Thrawn's secret TIE fighter program to the Phoenix Squadron. He also helped Bridger and Jarrus escape from the Lothal Imperial factory. Kallus was also visibly horrified by Thrawn's ruthless efforts to root out saboteurs at the factory, particularly the simulation "accident" that claimed the life of the worker Morad Sumar.<ref name="An Inside Man" />

Kallus' pro-rebel sympathy led him to leak information about Grand Admiral Thrawn's E-XD infiltrator droids to the rebellion. This information enabled the rebels Zeb, Chopper, and AP-5 to neutralize the threat. Kallus was impressed to learn that the rebels reprogrammed the infiltrator droid into an improvised bomb which destroyed an Imperial Star Destroyer.<ref name="Warhead" />

Kallus's dealings with the rebellion led him to trust Ezra, Chopper, and AP-5 when they came to rescue him from Thrawn's crackdown. Kallus also manipulated Lieutenant Lyste's trust to trick him into spying on Govenor Pryce and frame him as Fulcrum. Kallus' new-found sympathy for the rebellion made him willing to harm his fellow Imperial comrades in order to advance the rebels' interests and to protect his identity as Fulcrum. Kallus also had a respectful relationship with his former ISB instructor Colonel Wullf Yularen. Kallus took advantage of Yularen's respect for him to mislead the Colonel into believing that Lyste was Fulcrum. However, Thrawn deduced that Kallus was the real Fulcrum after learning that Kallus had withheld information about the identity of the rebel operative Ezra Bridger.<ref name="TIE" />

Kallus' new-found loyalty to the rebels led him to attempt to warn them that Thrawn had learned about their planned attack on Lothal. After Kallus put up a fierce but futile fight against Thrawn, the Grand Admiral remarked that he had the heart of a rebel, which Kallus took as a compliment. During the Battle of Atollon, Kallus watched the attack on the Rebel base in anger and despair, but he took the occasional opportunity to taunt his former Imperial comrades. Governor Pryce grew impatient with Kallus' taunts and ordered her stormtroopers to throw him out the airlock. However, Kallus was then able to overpower his guards and escape in an escape pod to join the rebels. When Kallus expressed gratitude to his former rebel foes for taking him in, Jarrus praised him for risking everything to help the rebellion.<ref name="Zero Hour" />

After joining the Rebel Alliance, Kallus grew a beard. As a rebel, Kallus shared Mon Mothma's revulsion towards the Partisan leader Saw Gerrara's brutal methods.<ref name="In the Name of the Rebellion" /> Kallus also believed that the smuggler Cikatro Vizago was untrustworthy and cautioned his rebel comrades against trusting Vizago.<ref name="The Occupation" />

Kallus fought alongside Ezra and his former rebel foes during the Liberation of Lothal. When confronted by Governor Pryce over his defection, Kallus responded that he stopped betraying himself the day he betrayed her Empire. Having befriended Zeb, Kallus traveled with Zeb following the Galactic Civil War to Lira San where he reconciled with the Lasat people he had formerly persecuted.<ref name="Family&Farewell" />

==Skills and abilities==
{{Quote|Only the Honor Guard of Lasan may carry a bo-rifle.''"<br />"''I know! I removed it from a guardsman myself!|Garazeb Orrelios and Kallus|Droids in Distress}}
[[File:Kallus ambushes the rebels.png|right|thumb|250px|Kallus often led his troops in combat]]
Kallus was trained in both riot control and heavy combat, and he wore an ISB helmet designed for such situations. He underwent extensive training to become proficient in fighting and was a dangerous foe in hand-to-hand combat. During the fall of Lasan, Kallus bested a [[Unidentified Lasat Honor Guard|Lasat guardsman]], who gave Kallus a bo-rifle as an acknowledgement of his defeat.<ref name="Visual Guide" /> He was able to successfully modify this weapon for close-quarters fighting and was able to go toe-to-toe with Orrelios, a trained Honor Guardsman, during a fight on Lothal.<ref name="Droids in Distress" /> While Kallus received training in unarmed combat from his time at the Imperial Academy, he was outmatched by Grand Admiral Thrawn in combat. Later, Kallus used his close-quarters combat skills to overpower two stormtroopers and escape the ''Chimaera'' aboard an escape pod.<ref name="Zero Hour" />

As a high-ranking Imperial officer and ISB operative, Kallus was familiar with code cylinders and how Imperial institutions worked. He used his inside knowledge of the Imperial Military to leak vital intelligence to the rebellion and tried to mislead Thrawn.<ref name="TIE" /> He was also highly skilled as with robotics and programming, as evidenced, for instance, by his reprogramming and redesign of an MSE-series-6 ("mouse") droid for surveillance, and his reprogramming of Grand Admiral Thrawn's own assassin droids.<ref name="TIE" /><ref name="Zero Hour" />

After defecting to the Rebellion, Kallus put his combat skills to good use fighting alongside his rebel comrades. He also used his knowledge of Imperial protocol and procedure to infiltrate the Dome and initiate Protocol 13.<ref name="Family&Farewell" />

==Equipment==
[[File:Kallus Bo-Rifle SWDL.png|left|thumb|250px|Agent Kallus with his bo-rifle in rifle mode.]]
Agent Kallus wore a gray [[Imperial military uniforms|Imperial uniform]] with a pair of black boots, gauntlet gloves over his hands, and a [[fleximetal]] cuirass. The armor was quite durable, being able to sustain a ricochet shot from an [[E-11 blaster rifle]].<ref name="Spark" /> His distinctive ISB combat helmet had blast-proof cheek pieces.<ref name="The Rebellion Begins" /> His belt was fitted with an [[Officer's disk|identity disk]]. The metallic [[Rank insignia plaque|rank insignia]] on the left breast of his armor comprised one row of four tiles, two blue, one silver, and one red.<ref name="Visual Guide" /> Later, his rank insignia changed, consisting of five tiles, three blue, and two yellow. During his time as a Commander, Kallus owned at least one red-tipped code cylinder.<ref name="TIE" />

In battle, Kallus used a J-19 bo-rifle given from a member of the Lasan High Honor Guard that he had defeated, which he was proficient with in ranged and close combat.<ref name="The Honorable Ones" /> As a Fulcrum operative, Kallus knew how to operate a transmitter, which he kept in Ezra's former home.<ref name="Zero Hour" /> After joining the Rebel Alliance, Kallus wore an earth-colored Alliance uniform, displaying the rank of Captain.<ref name="In the Name of the Rebellion" />

==Behind the scenes==
{{Quote|So Kallus, definitely an interesting character, and one to watch out for&mdash;especially if you're a rebel.|Dave Filoni|url=http://www.starwars.com/video/star-wars-rebels-meet-agent-kallus-imperial-enforcer}}
[[File:Kallus Chiss.png|thumb|right|250px|A preliminary design of Kallus depicting him as a Chiss.]]
Agent Kallus is one of the primary antagonists of the animated television series ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'', in which he is voiced by British actor [[David Oyelowo]]. Kallus was created as a rebel hunter and the most recurring antagonist for the rebel crew, one who would be on the front lines of conflicts between the rebels and the Empire. Kallus went through a number of different designs, including [[:File:Kallus Chiss.png|one]] in which he was depicted as a [[Chiss]],<ref name="Meet Kallus" /> a species that originated in the [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] novel ''[[Heir to the Empire]]'' by [[Timothy Zahn]].<ref name="Heir to the Empire">''[[Heir to the Empire]]''</ref> The production team settled on a human character, and Oyelowo was cast to the play the part. The show's co-creator, [[Carrie Beck]], said that Oyelowo was able to bring "a voice that is very authoritative, and very commanding, and very cool without betraying any sense of insecurity or weakness."<ref name="Meet Kallus" />

The character was first revealed at the [[2014]] Hasbro Toy Fair.<ref name="Toy Fair">{{Blog|official=true|2014/02/17/toy-fair-2014-star-wars-hasbro-toy-gallery/|Toy Fair 2014: Star Wars Hasbro Toy Gallery}}</ref> He appeared in multiple trailers, including the full trailer released on [[May 4]], 2014,<ref name="Full Trailer">{{SWYoutube|_soLH5MWGOg|Star Wars Rebels: Full Trailer (Official)}}</ref> before becoming the subject of his own introductory video.<ref name="Meet Kallus" /> He made his first on-screen appearance in ''[[Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion]]'',<ref name="Spark" /> the show's premiere television movie that debuted on [[October 3]], 2014.<ref name="Spark Premiere">{{SW|url=news/star-wars-rebels-spark-of-rebellion-premieres-friday-october-3-on-disney-channel|text=''Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion'' Premieres Friday, October 3 on Disney Channel}}</ref> Several chapters in the chapter book ''[[Battle to the End]]'', which was written as a supplement to ''Star Wars Rebels'', are written from the point-of-view of Kallus.<ref name="Battle to the End" />
