===The Separatist Crisis===
She was present in the session of the Galactic Senate in which [[Junior Representative]] [[Jar Jar Binks]] of [[Naboo]] proposed that Palpatine be given emergency executive powers in order to combat the alleged [[Separatist Crisis|threat]] that the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] posed to the Republic. The proposal was successful, and Palpatine declared that the [[Clone trooper|clone army]] created in secret on [[Kamino]] would become the [[Grand Army of the Republic]].<ref name="Episode II" />

===The Clone Wars===
[[File:Sly Moore SWTumblr.png|thumb|left|250px|Sly Moore was an Umbaran official with a background shrouded in mystery.]]

After the [[Battle of Coruscant]], she was present with the Chancellor in the [[Galaxies Opera House]] on [[Coruscant]] for a performance of the [[Mon Calamari]] play ''[[Squid Lake]]''. Palpatine dismissed her and his other aides upon the arrival of [[Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker]], to whom he told the [[Tragedy of Darth Plagueis|story]] of [[Darth Plagueis]], his [[Sith Master]], as part of his plan to seduce Skywalker to the [[dark side of the Force]].<ref name="Episode III" />

===Rise of the Empire===
[[File:Declaration.png|thumb|right|300px|Sly Moore and Mas Amedda were with their master, Palpatine on the day he declared himself Emperor.]]

A group of [[Jedi Master]]s, led by [[Mace Windu]], [[Duel in Palpatine's office|attempted]] to arrest the Chancellor. Palpatine killed all four [[Jedi]] Masters and publicly declared that the [[Jedi Order]] had attempted to take over the Republic. Moore was again present in a special session of the Senate, in which Palpatine [[Proclamation of the New Order|proclaimed]] that the Republic would be transformed into the [[Galactic Empire]] to ensure security and stability after the Clone War and the so-called Jedi rebellion.<ref name="Episode III" />
