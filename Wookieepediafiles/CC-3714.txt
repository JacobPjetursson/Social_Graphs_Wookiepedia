'''CC-3714''', nicknamed "'''Fil'''," was a veteran [[clone trooper commander]] in the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army of the Republic]] who was assigned to recently promoted [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Nahdar Vebb/Legends|Nahdar Vebb]] during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. In [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], he led a [[Squad/Legends|squad]] of [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]] on a [[Mission to Vassek's third moon|mission]] to the [[Third moon of Vassek|third moon]] of [[Vassek/Legends|Vassek]], in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]]. Accompanied by Vebb and [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Kit Fisto/Legends|Kit Fisto]], the [[CC-3714's squad|group]] searched for [[Trade Federation/Legends|Trade Federation]] [[Viceroy/Legends|Viceroy]] [[Nute Gunray/Legends|Nute Gunray]], who had been recently [[Rescue on the Tranquility/Legends|freed]] from [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] captivity. Unbeknownst to the group, Gunray, along with [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederate]] [[Head of State/Legends|Head of State]] [[Count/Legends|Count]] [[Dooku/Legends|Dooku]], had laid a trap for the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], using a [[Homing beacon/Legends|homing beacon]] to deceive the Jedi and make them believe that Gunray was hiding in a [[Grievous's castle|castle]] on the [[Moon/Legends|moon]].

After the group realized that they had fallen for a trap, the Confederate [[General/Legends|General]] [[Grievous/Legends|Grievous]] arrived at the castle, which was in fact his personal retreat. The Jedi and [[Cloning/Legends|clone]] [[Trooper/Legends|troopers]] tried to capture Grievous, but after a short brawl with the Republic squad, the [[Cyborg/Legends|cyborg]] general fled to the stronghold's secret command center. After Grievous opened a molten incinerator pit trap, which was under Fil and the Jedi, the cyborg general released his pet [[Roggwart/Legends|roggwart]], [[Gor/Legends|Gor]], to attack them. Fil was caught by the beast, which used its tail to grab the [[Commander/Legends|commander]]. The Jedi tried to free him, but Fil was [[Death/Legends|killed]] when Gor slammed the clone on the ground. Vebb was later murdered at the hands of Grievous, leaving Fisto as the only survivor of the mission.

[[File:FilGivesOrders-LoG.png|thumb|left|250px|Fil, telling Bel and Niner to watch after their shuttle]]
[[Clone trooper commander|Clone Commander]] 3714,<ref name="tcwce" /> nicknamed "Fil,"<ref name="lair" /> was born on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Kamino/Legends|Kamino]] to be commissioned for the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army of the Republic]] during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], a [[The galaxy/Legends|galaxy-wide]] conflict between the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]].<ref name="databank">{{DB|organization|clonetroopers|Clone troopers}}</ref> Fil was assigned to recently promoted [[Mon Calamari/Legends|Mon Calamari]] [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] [[Nahdar Vebb/Legends|Nahdar Vebb]], and served under him in several battles during the Clone Wars.<ref name="tcwce" /> In [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]],<ref name="Date" /> Fil was the leader of a [[Cloning/Legends|clone]] [[Trooper/Legends|trooper]] [[CC-3714's squad|squad]] that participated in a [[Mission to Vassek's third moon|mission]] to the [[Third moon of Vassek|third moon]] of the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] [[Planet/Legends|world]] of [[Vassek/Legends|Vassek]].<ref name="lair" />

During the mission, Fil and his squad accompanied Vebb. Vebb's former [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]], [[Kit Fisto/Legends|Kit Fisto]], joined Vebb and his men to capture [[Trade Federation/Legends|Trade Federation]] [[Viceroy/Legends|Viceroy]] [[Nute Gunray/Legends|Nute Gunray]], who had recently been [[Rescue on the Tranquility/Legends|saved]] from Republic captivity by the [[Dark Acolyte]] [[Asajj Ventress/Legends|Asajj Ventress]], laid a trap for the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] in [[Grievous's castle|a building]] on the Vassek [[Moon/Legends|moon]]. Jedi Master [[Luminara Unduli/Legends|Luminara Unduli]] and Jedi [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] [[Ahsoka Tano/Legends|Ahsoka Tano]], who had been escorting Gunray to the galactic [[Capital/Legends|capital]] of Coruscant aboard [[Venator-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Venator''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Tranquility/Legends|Tranquility]]'' before the viceroy escaped, told Fisto that they had tracked Gunray to the [[Vassek system/Legends|Vassek system]].<ref name="lair" />

Fil ordered fellow clone troopers [[Bel/Legends|Bel]] and [[Niner/Legends|Niner]] to look after their [[Nu-class attack shuttle|''Nu''-class attack shuttle]], while he went with the rest of the [[Squad/Legends|squad]] and followed the Jedi into the castle.<ref name="lair" /> Fisto denied Fil's use of a [[Thermal detonator/Legends|thermal detonator]] to open the lair's door, and instead pressed a secret stone that activated the entrance. After they entered the castle, the group made their way to a room called the "sanctum overlook," where a faint voice was heard.<ref name="lairD" /> A number of [[B1 battle droid/Legends|B1 battle droids]] were talking to Gunray, who, unbeknownst to the Jedi and clones, was in [[Hologram/Legends|holographic form]] in order to lure the Jedi into the trap. Once the group dispatched the droids, however, Vebb used [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] to [[Telekinesis/Legends|turn]] Gunray's chair around, revealing the hologram of the Viceroy. After Gunray activated a homing beacon near his chair, his hologram faded away. Dooku contacted the Jedi, telling the group that while Gunray was unavailable for capture, he offered them an unnamed alternative prize. Fisto and Vebb knew that they had been tricked into the lair, and it was some form of a trap. Fil was worried about the current situation after the group walked down a dark hallway. Upon witnessing [[Kaleesh/Legends|Kaleesh]] statues and replacement cyborg masks, Fisto indicated that they were in the lair of the Confederate [[General/Legends|General]] [[Grievous/Legends|Grievous]]. The group soon realized that Grievous would arrive at any moment, and that an opportunity to capture the cyborg general&mdash;which could turn the tide of the war&mdash;had presented itself.<ref name="lair" />

====Death====
{{Quote|Stand firm. There may be worse things here than Grievous.''"<br />"''It looks like you're right about that sir!|Kit Fisto and Fil, witnessing Gor|audio=WorseThingsThanGrievous-LoG.ogg|Lair of Grievous}}
After Grievous landed in the castle's secret [[Hangar/Legends|hangar]], he was ambushed by the group. Fil and his men drew their [[Blaster/Legends|blasters]], but Grievous did not comply with Fisto's demands for surrender and ignited four [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsabers]]. The Jedi managed to contain the former [[Kaleesh/Legends|Kaleesh]] [[Warlord/Legends|warlord]], severing one of his [[Cybernetics/Legends|cybernetic]] hands. Fil ordered his men to use [[Grappling hook/Legends|grappling hooks]] to hold Grievous, while Vebb and Fisto tried to finish Grievous off. Grievous released himself from the clones, but Fisto severed Grievous's cyborg body in half from the waist down. The cyborg general fled from the area and entered the lair's secret command center. The battle with Grievous had resulted in the loss of two clone troopers, leaving only Fil and [[Unidentified clone trooper (Vassek moon)|one last trooper]] alongside the Jedi.<ref name="lair" />

[[File:Vebb angered.png|thumb|left|250px|Nahdar Vebb angered over Fil's death after the Jedi defeat Gor]]
Fil and the other survivors tried to flee from the castle, but Grievous trapped them by shutting the outer doors. Fil contacted Bel and Niner, who were guarding their [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]], and ordered them to contact their fleet, which was near the [[Inner Rim/Legends|Inner Rim]] planet of [[Bestine IV/Legends|Bestine IV]], for more clone trooper reinforcements. However, one of Grievous's [[IG-100 MagnaGuard/Legends|IG-100 MagnaGuards]] used a [[Missile launcher/Legends|missile launcher]] to [[Death/Legends|kill]] the clones. In the command center, Grievous revealed a trap to the surviving Republic squad and opened a molten incinerator pit, which was under Fil and one remaining clone trooper.<ref name="lairD" /> Fil and the remaining trooper fell into the pit; the other clone was killed, but the [[Commander/Legends|commander]] fired his grappling hook, and with the help of Vebb and Fisto, managed to save himself.<ref name="lair" />

Grievous then decided to release his pet [[Roggwart/Legends|roggwart]], [[Gor/Legends|Gor]], to attack the group. Upon seeing Gor, Fil fired his blaster pistol at the beast's head, which was deflected from Gor's [[Armor/Legends|head armor]]. The roggwart disarmed Fisto, and Vebb ordered Fil to shoot and distract Gor while he himself [[Force Jump]]ed onto the creature. However, when Vebb stabbed Gor in the back with his lightsaber, Gor used his long tail to lift Fil off the ground. As Gor held onto Fil with his tail, both of the Jedi tried to save the clone commander, but it was too late. Fisto slashed at the roggwart's face with his lightsaber; Fil was slammed onto the floor by Gor and was instantly killed on impact. Eventually, Vebb was murdered at the hands of Grievous, and soon the cyborg fought Fisto, though the Jedi Master escaped and departed the moon.<ref name="lair" />

However, Fil was unable to defend himself and was killed by the roggwart.
