{{Quote|Call it ''research''. Call it ''madness''. Call it ''art''&mdash;it's all the ''same'' to me: I must know ''more''.|Cornelius Evazan|Doctor Aphra 25: The Catastrophe Con, Part VI}}
[[Doctor]] '''Cornelius Evazan''', also known as the '''Mutilator of Milvayne''', was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] from the [[planet]] [[Alsakan]] who was a promising cosmetic surgeon until he became gripped by madness and began practicing "creative surgery" on his patients, leaving his victims horrifically disfigured. After information concerning his cruel medical experiments came to light, an encounter with a [[bounty hunter]] left his face hideously scarred. The [[Aqualish]] thug [[Ponda Baba]] rescued Evazan from the hunter, following which the two formed an uneasy partnership and began [[Smuggler|smuggling]] [[spice]] for the [[Hutt]] [[crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]]. Wanted men, Evazan assumed the alias of "'''[[Roofoo]]'''," while Baba became known as "[[Sawkee]]." In the [[Jedha City|Holy City]] on [[Jedha]], the fugitive [[Cyberneticist|cyborgist]] used his ghastly medical techniques to produce an order of servants known as the [[Decraniated]].

Shortly before the [[Battle of Yavin]], Evazan and Baba were patrons in the [[Chalmun's Cantina|Mos Eisley Cantina]] on [[Tatooine]]. When a drunk Baba decided to pick a fight with a local [[farm]]boy named [[Luke Skywalker]], Evazan quickly escalated the conflict, causing Skywalker's guardian, a hermit named [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], to intervene. The [[pirate]]s drew their [[blaster pistol]]s on the wizened man&mdash;in secret one of the few remaining [[Jedi Master]]s&mdash;but Kenobi used [[Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber (Jedi Master)|his lightsaber]] to slash Evazan across the chest and [[Dismemberment|sever]] Baba's right [[Limb|arm]] before they could fire. Evazan tried to use his medical training to reattach Baba's arm but failed, nearly [[Death|killing]] the Aqualish in the process.

Hiding from the [[death]] sentences he had received, Evazan infiltrated a [[biofarm]] on [[Thannt]] and stole a [[pluripleq]], a [[Changeling|shape-shifting]] creature. He used it to disguise his face, taking the name "'''[[Lopset Yas]]'''" and forged his own backstory of working as an [[electrician]]. At some point, Yas was [[Prison|imprisoned]] by the [[Galactic Empire]] in the [[wreckage-prison]] [[Accresker Jail]], becoming a member of their [[Accresker Penal Legion|expendable fighting force]] in [[Chelli Lona Aphra's squad|a]] [[squad]] with the rogue [[archaeologist]] [[Doctor]] [[Chelli Lona Aphra]], who nicknamed him '''"Flopso"'''.

After Accresker Jail was [[Skirmish aboard Accresker Jail|decommissioned]] and fired on a collision course with [[Tiferep Major]], Evazan followed Aphra, still in disguise. To attract the vigilante [[Tam Posla]], who had been searching for him, "Lopset" pretended to shape-shift into Evazan, tricking the bounty hunter into agreeing to rescue them. Aphra and Posla agreed to trade Evazan, both of them unaware of his true identity. Thinking he had been tricked, Posla returned to the prison with "Yas" to arrest Aphra. While there, Evazan managed to incapacitate both Aphra and the [[assassin droid]] [[0-0-0]], taking them aboard Posla's [[Tam Posla's ship|ship]]. Revealing who he truly was, Evazan removed his [[proximity bomb]] and placed it in Triple-Zero, leaving the two stranded together for his own entertainment.

===Creating the Decraniated===
{{Quote|He's a sadist, a killer, a twister of flesh&hellip;''"<br />"''&hellip;the most evil being in the galaxy.|Tam Posla and Caysin Bog describe Evazan|Doctor Aphra 18: Remastered, Part V}}
Adopting the respective aliases of "[[Roofoo]]" and "[[Sawkee]]", Evazan and Baba committed a rash of crimes while visiting [[Milvayne]]. [[Tam Posla]], an interstellar [[Law enforcement agency|lawman]] representing the [[Milvayne Authority]], began investigating the matter when similar reports of kidnapping, forced servitude, and the surgical alteration of victims came from the desert [[moon]] of [[Jedha]]. Indeed, the pair had taken up residence in Jedha's [[Jedha City|Holy City]], where he pieced together [[Caysin Bog]], a high-[[gravity]] [[humanoid]] blown apart in an insurgency strike. The fugitive surgeon also used his ghastly medical techniques to produce an order of servants known as the [[Decraniated]],<ref name="The Ultimate Visual Guide">''[[Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide]]''</ref> of which Bog was the prototype.<ref name="Doctor Aphra 18">''[[Doctor Aphra 18: Remastered, Part V]]''</ref> Evazan transformed wounded or incapacitated victims of the [[Jedha insurgency|local insurgency]] with [[Neuro-box interface|cybernetic technology]] to make them as subservient as droids, using the procedure to strip them of their identities before selling them into unwilling servitude.<ref name="The Ultimate Visual Guide" />

===Cantina encounters===
{{Quote|One moment. You're not giving him narcotics ''now'', are you? Today?''"<br />"''«No. Because Solo dropped cargo. I have nothing to give. Why?»''"<br />"''Greedo the Rodian is making a play for Solo. Ponda Baba and Evazan are backing it.

Which Evazan is better? Medicated, or not?|[[Lirin Car'n]] and Muftak|The Kloo Horn Cantina Caper|audio=Muftak-Carn.ogg}}
Evazan and Baba departed the city<ref name="Evazan Escape" /> prior to its destruction by the Death Star<ref name="Rogue One" /> and traveled to the planet [[Tatooine]], where they resumed their illegal medical experiments.<ref name="AEYKTY Updated and Expanded">''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know, Updated and Expanded]]''</ref> Due to his dumb and dangerous behavior, no one wanted to sell Evazan anodyne chemical compounds to help him cope with his injuries. As a result, he made a semi-regular arrangement with [[Muftak]]; the doctor would give him a thousand [[credit]]s to pay the smuggler [[Han Solo]] for his drugs, minus not-inconsiderable shipping and handling charges. Upon delivery of the illicit substance, Evazan would then pay the [[Talz]] a completion bonus and hazard stipend. While the arrangment was meant to be discrete, everyone knew about it. Despite this, the Baba and Evazan agreed to back the [[Rodian]] bounty hunter [[Greedo]]'s play against Solo.<ref name="The Kloo Horn Cantina Caper">{{Shortstory|story=The Kloo Horn Cantina Caper|book=From a Certain Point of View|bformatted=''From a Certain Point of View''}}</ref> Baba and Evazan were patrons at a [[Chalmun's Cantina|cantina]] in [[Mos Eisley]] [[spaceport]] shortly before the [[Battle of Yavin]].

Baba approached him from behind with his [[blaster]] drawn, but Evazan held him back, allowing Bossk to depart without incident.<ref name="Bounty Hunt">''[[Bounty Hunt]]''</ref>

[[File:Bar_fight.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Obi-Wan Kenobi confronts Evazan and Baba in the Mos Eisley Cantina.]]
Later, the doctor was talking<ref name="A New Hope" /> to [[Kabe]],<ref name="Kabe Card Trader">{{Topps|set=Star Wars: Card Trader|sformat=''Star Wars'': Card Trader|cardname=Kabe (Mos Eisley Series 1)|link=http://starwarscardtrader.wikia.com/wiki/Kabe_(Mos_Eisley_Series_1)}}</ref> a [[Chadra-Fan]] female who frequented the [[cantina]],<ref name="Chadra-Fan">{{Databank|chadra-fan|Chadra-Fan|archivedate=20170106021520}}</ref> when a drunk Baba,<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" /> bored and looking for excitement,<ref name="Ponda Baba" /> decided to pick a fight with [[Luke Skywalker]], a young [[farm]]boy who had taken a seat to the right of them at the bar.<ref name="A New Hope" /> Assuming Skywalker would be an easy target,<ref name="Doctor Cornelius Evazan" /> Evazan quickly escalated the argument<ref name="Ponda Baba" /> despite the boy's youthful apprehension.

However, paying little heed to the old man,<ref name="Doctor Cornelius Evazan" /> Evazan angrily hurled the young farmboy into a nearby table, and, ignoring Wuher's protest,<ref name="A New Hope" /> the pirates drew their [[blaster pistol]]s. Given no other choice, the elderly Kenobi&mdash;in secret one of the few remaining [[Jedi Master]]s&mdash;ignited [[Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber (Jedi Master)|his lightsaber]]<ref name="A New Hope" /> and cut a deep slash in Evazan's chest, causing the doctor to fall back against the bar<ref name="Star Wars: A New Hope">[[Star Wars: A New Hope (paperback novel)|''Star Wars: A New Hope'' junior novelization]]</ref> screaming in pain.<ref name="A New Hope" /> Kenobi then used his [[lightsaber]] to [[Dismemberment|sever]] Baba's right arm, effectively disarming the pair before they could fire their weapons,<ref name="A New Hope" /> Evazan supporting the injured Aqualish on the cantina floor.<ref name="Complete Locations">''[[Star Wars: Complete Locations (2016)|Star Wars: Complete Locations]]''</ref>

===Changing identity===
{{Quote|See, I had a death sentence&mdash;several, actually&mdash;so! I became someone else. A tragedy, to hide a face as lovely as mine.|Cornelius Evazan|Doctor Aphra 25: The Catastrophe Con, Part VI}}
Some [[time]] after the encounter, Evazan infiltrated a [[biofarm]] on [[Thannt]]. There, he stole a [[Changeling|shape-shifting]] creature called a [[pluripleq]]. Wishing to evade the many death sentences he had earned, Evazan used the pluripleq to disguise himself, taking up a new identity and using the name "Lopset Yas".<ref name="Aphra 25">''[[Doctor Aphra 25: The Catastrophe Con, Part VI]]''</ref> Around the same time, Bog and Posla continued their hunt for Evazan, by which point the doctor had earned the death sentence on thirteen systems.<ref name="Doctor Aphra 18" /> Following Bog's untimely death, Posla learned of Evazan's scuffle on Tatooine, and obtained Baba's severed arm. He eventually discovered the doctor had infiltrated the biofarm on Thannt but, unfortunately for Posla, Evazan's trail had run cold for a month<ref name="Doctor Aphra 22">''[[Doctor Aphra 22: The Catastrophe Con, Part III]]''</ref> thanks to his identity change.<ref name="Aphra 25" />

===Imprisoned===
{{Quote|Wh-where are we going? What's the plan here?''"<br />"''Dek-Nil, meet Flopso. Flopso, meet Dek-Nil.''"<br />"''It's, uh. It's Lopset Yas. S-so&mdash;you know this droid?|Cornelius Evazan, as Lopset Yas, and Chelli Aphra|Doctor Aphra 20: The Catastrophe Con, Part I}}
Eventually, "Lopset Yas" was taken by the [[Galactic Empire]] and [[Prison|imprisoned]] in the [[wreckage-prison]] known as [[Accresker Jail]], assigned into [[Chelli Lona Aphra's squad|a squad]] led by [[Unidentified hubdroid|a hubdroid]].<ref name="Aphra 20" /> During his time in the prison, he saw several things that led him to believe it was haunted, such as [[power coupling]]s frying people to death despite having no power, and [[boarding-spike]]s cutting another prisoner in half.<ref name="Aphra 21">''[[Doctor Aphra 21: The Catastrophe Con, Part II]]''</ref>

Evazan and the rest of his squad were deployed into an [[attack on an EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate]] as part of the [[Accresker Penal Legion]]. During the battle, [[Chelli Lona Aphra]], a member of the squad, sabotaged their [[hubdroid]] by feeding it false information. "Yas" asked what was wrong with the [[droid]], but Aphra just greeted him, calling him by his pet name, Flopso. As Evazan corrected her on his fake name, the hubdroid exploded, killing all the other members of the squad. "Yas" began to panic as their [[proximity bomb]]s started beeping, about to detonate. However, another hubdroid, [[Dek-Nil]], arrived, and "Yas" begged him to let him and Aphra into his [[Squad Dek-Nil|squad]], which had been lost in a series of improbable accidents. Before their implants could explode, Dek-Nil transferred them into his squad, despite detecting three lifeforms instead of two<ref name="Aphra 20" /> due to Evazan's pluripleq.<ref name="Aphra 25" />

[[File:The Accresker force ghost.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aphra and "Yas" notice the Force spirit]]
After informing "Yas" that Dek-Nil was her droid, Aphra led them around a corner, where an [[escape pod]] was stuck on the edge of the prison's [[airdome]]. As Aphra was about to discuss helping "Yas" escape Accresker Jail, the [[restraining bolt]] on Dek-Nil mysteriously moved, taking control of him and leading him to destroy the escape pod due to the Imperial programming. Evazan and Aphra then noticed a [[Force spirit]], but were were ordered back to their sector before they could investigate. Returning to the prison, "Yas" showed Aphra a [[transmitter]] he had discovered and repaired, telling her that he knew she had connections to someone who could help them escape. He gave her the transmitter, asking her who she would call.<ref name="Aphra 20" />

Aphra took the transmitter and contacted [[Magna Tolvan]], telling her secrets that forced Tolvan to help her escape to protect both of them. As she did so, Evazan was almost crushed by some wreckage which had fallen down on its own. Aphra saved him, and "Yas" told her of the experiences he has had in the prison, claiming that he believed the jail was haunted. Aphra disregarded the idea, but confronted "Yas" about being a shape-shifter, as she saw him partly change as she was trying to save him from the wreckage. Evazan pretended to shape-shifted into the forms of several individuals,  including himself, claiming they had used him for his powers in the past. Aphra quoted her [[Lona Aphra|mother]], telling him that evil was a measure of how much people's choices took away the choices of others.<ref name="Aphra 21" />

===Escape attempt===
{{Quote|L-look&mdash;we just picked a fight with a-a-a haunted mushroom! Why aren't we running?|"Lopset Yas", to Chelli Aphra|Doctor Aphra 22: The Catastrophe Con, Part III}}
[[File:Aphra Dek-Nil and Lopset.jpg|thumb|left|180px|"Lopset" looks back as Aphra follows the Force spirit]]
Squad Dek-Nil was later assigned to fight in an [[Attack on a pirate station|attack]] on a [[Unidentified pirate station|pirate station]]. During the engagement, Aphra used [[Imperial authority code 6690B1|an Imperial code]] to override Dek-Nil's restraining bolt. Aphra led Dek-Nil and "Yas" over to where Tolvan was waiting for them in a [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighter]]. But before they could escape, the Force spirit they had seen earlier appeared and destroyed the [[sensor disruptor]]s keeping Tolvan's TIE fighter from being detected. Aphra became distracted by it, and as she was led away by the spirit, Evazan followed her, encountering the wreckage of a [[Penumbra-1 shattersprite]].<ref name="Aphra 21" />

As they investigated the ship, Tolvan was attacked by [[Sana Starros]], a [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel]] operative, who flew in on her ship, the ''[[Volt Cobra]]''. As it tore her TIE fighter apart, Tolvan jumped out with a rocket launcher on her shoulder and fired at the ''Cobra'', shredding through its port side. Witnessing this, Yas asked Aphra what she thought was happening, but she was distracted by the spirit, who disassembled Dek-Nil with [[the Force]]. Aphra shot the spirit, and it disappeared, revealing an infestation of [[gundravian hookspore]]s, which Evazan recognized as the most infectious saprophyte in existence. They rapidly fired at the hookspores, which retreated into the ship, revealing the corpse of [[Unidentified Jedi (Accresker Jail)|a long-dead Jedi]]. Before Aphra could retrieve the Jedi's [[lightsaber]], the battle concluded, and the airdome began to retreat. As they ran away, Evazan retrieved Dek-Nil's [[central processor]], preventing their implanted proximity bombs from detonating.<ref name="Aphra 22">''[[Doctor Aphra 22: The Catastrophe Con, Part III]]''</ref>

Evazan and Aphra ran into Tolvan and Starros, but were encountered by a hubdroid and told to return to the prison. The hubdroid took Aphra away for interrogation, leaving "Yas", Tolvan and Starros to return on their own. As they arrived, "Yas" told them that he was thankful that their situation couldn't get any worse, but he was proven wrong when the presence of the hookspores was discovered by the command of Accresker Jail, who announced that the jail was [[Skirmish aboard Accresker Jail|decommissioned]] and would be propelled onto a collision course with<ref name="Aphra 22" /> [[Tiferep Major]], a [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]]-affiliated [[planet]].<ref name="Aphra 23">''[[Doctor Aphra 23: The Catastrophe Con, Part IV]]''</ref>

===Trapped in Accresker===
{{Quote|Th-the ghost. It's on a rampage.''"<br />"''How many times, Lopset? Don't call it that. It's a sentient telekinetic fungus. "Ghost" just sounds silly.|"Lopset Yas" and Chelli Aphra|Doctor Aphra 23: The Catastrophe Con, Part IV}}
In an attempt to find a way off the prison, Aphra made use of Lopset's "shape-shifting" powers to trick Tam Posla into rescuing them. Evazan pretended to shape-shift into his true form as Aphra contacted Posla. Upon seeing Evazan, Posla agreed to take [[Tam Posla's ship|his ship]] to Accresker Jail. Evazan changed back into his disguised appearance as Starros and Tolvan discovered that the staff off Accresker were abandoning the [[Arquitens-class command cruiser|''Arquitens''-class command cruiser]] that pulled the prison. "Yas" asked if they should run, which Aphra agreed with.<ref name="Aphra 22" />

[[File:Force spirit kills several.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Lopset watches the Force spirit kill several prisoners]]
As the [[cruiser]] crashed into the body of the wreckage-prison, Evazan watched as the convicts began to riot and fight each other. The convicts recognized Aphra as the one that had been interrogated, and she and "Yas" once again agreed to run. They turned around to see a prisoner aiming a large gun at them, but the prisoner was killed by the Force spirit, who then killed several others. Evazan noticed that the spirit disappeared if it strayed too far from its ship, and Aphra connected it to the dead Jedi they had discovered earlier. Tolvan suggested breaking into the ''Arquitens''-class cruiser, but "Yas" asked whether they should wait for Posla to rescue them. Aphra disregarded the possibility of Posla coming to Accresker, so Starros decided to use the large weapon they had been threatened with earlier to break through the wall of the cruiser. Evazan helped hold the gun, and then entered the cruiser behind Starros, Tolvan and Aphra.<ref name="Aphra 23" />

Inside the cruiser, Evazan discovered [[Bor Ifriem|the]] interrogation [[Bor gullet|bor]], which had not been properly refrozen. Aphra discovered that an escape pod still remained in the cruiser, but they had no way of getting to it. Yas suggested the large gun, but the weapon was too heavy to move. Aphra took Dek-Nil's head from Yas so that she could slice into the generator that controlled the prison's [[gravity]]. Aphra did so, setting the gravity to half of what it had been while also bringing the wreckage of the hookspore-infected ship towards them. Yas took the piece of Dek-Nil back as they made their way through the prison, arriving at the Penumbra-1. The hookspores briefly possessed all four of them, but was unable to sense anything from Yas, rejecting him as a potential host. Starros realized that Aphra had purposely brought the Jedi's ship towards them so she could retrieve the lightsaber, telling her that the hookspores would not move until they had a heroic host to possess.<ref name="Aphra 23" />

===Revealing the truth===
{{Quote|Irony is, if Posla didn't get so angry at being lied to, he might've realized! He had his man after all.|Cornelius Evazan, revealing his identity|Doctor Aphra 25: The Catastrophe Con, Part VI}}
Aphra led Starros, Tolvan and "Yas" to the single remaining escape pod in the wreckage of the cruiser. While Starros and Tolvan climbed into the escape pod, Evazan remained outside with Aphra, who launched the escape pod. Tolvan, who had not realized that Aphra was intending to stay behind, leapt out of the pod at the last second, leaving Starros alone in the launched pod. Aphra was irritated with Tolvan, telling her that she had only planned to escape alone. "Yas" questioned this, and Aphra quickly corrected herself, ensuring him that her plan would still work with the three of them.<ref name="Aphra 24">''[[Doctor Aphra 24: The Catastrophe Con, Part V]]''</ref>

[[File:Lopset Yas frozen.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Tam Posla inspects the frozen Evazan]]
Evazan followed Aphra and Tolvan to the main launch [[hangar]], and Aphra told him to remain standing on a grille in the floor. Before "Lopset" could ask Aphra why he needed to stand there, Tam Posla arrived in his ship. Aphra began speaking to Evazan, who realized she wanted him to "shape-shift" back into his true form. Pretending to be distressed by Aphra's attempt to exploit him, he recalled the quote Aphra told him when he first revealed his ability. Evazan shape-shifted out of his disguise, acting as if he was worried that he would give himself away. Reminding "Yas" of the frozen interrogation bor they had seen previously, she revealed that he was standing on top of a [[coolant grille]], which she activated, freezing Evazan. Tam Posla exited his ship to confirm that Aphra had Evazan, and fell for the "trick". Posla took the chunk of ice containing Evazan aboard his ship, and left Accresker Jail.<ref name="Aphra 24" />

As he flew away, Posla looked behind him at his frozen prisoner, having doubts about whether it was truly who he thought it was. In order to find out, he ordered his ship to divert its power to the [[heating array]], so that the ice containing "Yas" would melt.<ref name="Aphra 24" /> After it did so, Evazan pretended that he was Yas, and Posla returned to Accresker Jail so he could confront Aphra. Evazan followed him, and found Aphra watching a transmission of [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] interrogating Tolvan. Posla stepped out to arrest Aphra, but was attacked from behind by [[0-0-0]] and killed. Evazan escaped, meeting up with Aphra as Triple-Zero was dragging her to [[Touring ship|his ship]]. He shot the [[assassin droid]], pretending to save Aphra, who began to thank him. Evazan then [[stun]]ned Aphra and took both her and the droid aboard Tam Posla's ship.<ref name="Aphra 25" />

[[File:Evazan unmasked.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Evazan reveals his true identity]]
By the time that Aphra woke up and questioned what he had done, Evazan had begun to work on the incapacitated Triple-Zero, implanting his proximity bomb in the droid. Evazan turned to Aphra, removing the pluripleq from his face and revealing who he truly was. He finished his work, telling a shocked Aphra that her own proximity bomb was now linked to  the one placed in 0-0-0. As he did so, Ponda Baba docked with the ship, and Evazan began to leave, taking the Aqualish's severed arm from the ship. He repeated the quote that Aphra had said to him, wishing to test her mother's theory. As he left, boarding the ship that his friend has brought, he told Aphra that she and Triple-Zero deserved to be together.<ref name="Aphra 25" />

[[File:TheIntimidatingShoulderPoke-ANH.png|thumb|right|275px|Evazan attempts to intimidate Luke Skywalker.]]
Prior to being gripped by madness, Doctor Cornelius Evazan was a promising surgeon,<ref name="Updated and Expanded" /> though he later gained notoriety for the cruelty he inflicted upon his patients,<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" /> while his reputation as a smuggler and murderer also made him many enemies across the [[galaxy]]. He and Ponda Baba enjoyed brawling and gunning down defenseless beings,<ref name="Updated and Expanded" /> and Evazan was quick to antagonize those who crossed him, as demonstrated by his brushes with Cassian Andor on Jedha<ref name="Rogue One" /> and Luke Skywalker in Mos Eisley.<ref name="A New Hope" /> It was said that he never stopped until his victims begged him for death, just so he could say no.<ref name="Doctor Aphra 18" />

A self-described "techflesh artist",<ref name="Doctor Aphra 18" /> Evazan was boastful of his infamy, openly informing Skywalker in the Mos Eisley Cantina that he had the death sentence on twelve systems. After Baba began to bully Skywalker,<ref name="Doctor Cornelius Evazan" /> Evazan was quick to escalate the argument,<ref name="Ponda Baba" /> even going so far as to threaten Skywalker before Obi-Wan Kenobi interceded. Ignoring the old man's attempt to smooth the rising tension, the doctor resorted to violence, shoving the farmboy aside and drawing his blaster pistol, which ended poorly for both Evazan and Baba.<ref name="A New Hope" />

To avoid his many death sentences, Evazan used a pluripleq to change his face. Adopting a new name, "Lopset Yas",<ref name="Aphra 25" /> he managed to stay off the grid for over a month,<ref name="Aphra 22" /> until he revealed himself to Chelli Aphra.<ref name="Aphra 25" /> As Yas, he was quick to become nervous or fearful, begging Dek-Nil to let him into his squad after his first hubdroid exploded,<ref name="Aphra 20" /> and gaining a stutter whenever he became frightened.<ref name="Aphra 22" /> He quickly learned a lot about Aphra, second-guessing her connections with the underworld.<ref name="Aphra 20" /> Evazan was also very conscious of his surroundings, noticing a lot of weird doings in the Accresker Jail. He also trusted Chelli Aphra a lot, having to follow her wherever they she went due to the hubdroid they had in common. When she followed the Force spirit to the Penumbra-1 shattersprite Yas was quick to follow<ref name="Aphra 21" /> and he made sure to keep Dek-Nil's central processor to keep their implants from detonating.<ref name="Aphra 22" /> He continued to carry the piece of Dek-Nil even when the implants were disabled.<ref name="Aphra 23" />

[[File:Flopso.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Evazan, as "Lopset Yas"]]
A [[human]] male,<ref name="Updated and Expanded" /> Evazan had light skin<ref name="A New Hope" /> and stood at a height of 1.77 [[meter]]s.<ref name="Updated and Expanded" /> His [[eye]]s were colored [[Color|hazel]],<ref name="Eyes" /> though his right eye was blind and the flesh around it severely scarred, while his [[nose]] looked as if it had barely survived an unfortunate encounter with a meat shredder.<ref name="Star Wars: A New Hope" /> Due to his wounds, Evazan lived in a constant state of pain and anger and relied on a constant, alternating barrage of narcotics and physical violence to mitigate his perpetual agony.<ref name="The Kloo Horn Cantina Caper" /> His [[hair]] was colored brown with patches of gray, though he showed signs of balding, and stubble covered the lower half of his face.<ref name="A New Hope" /> Evazan had foul-smelling breath.<ref name="Star Wars: A New Hope" />

When using his pluripleq, Evazan could take many forms, including [[Kelko Dev]] and [[Sandewar Mandewar]]. But he usually had a similar appearance to the [[Abednedo (species)|Abednedo]] [[species]], having [[Color|brown]] skin, and eyes that changed color over time.<ref name="Aphra 21" />

==Skills and abilities==
{{Quote|E-electrician. You said you were an electr--''"<br />"''"Multidisciplinary", I said. Though I prefer "cyborganic artist".|Chelli Aphra and Evazan|Doctor Aphra 22: The Catastrophe Con, Part III}}
Evazan was also a skilled [[electrician]]. He was able to find and rebuild a transmitter on Accresker Jail, and gave it to Aphra to use.<ref name="Aphra 20" /> Evazan also had a knowledge of other subjects, able to recognize the gundravian hookspores and describe them in some depth.<ref name="Aphra 22" />

==Equipment==
{{Quote|No blasters! No blasters!|Wuher, as Cornelius Evazan draws his blaster pistol|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}
Evazan wore a long-sleeved khaki [[shirt]] underneath a brown vest, a pair of dark-brown [[pants]], and a pair of black [[boot]]s. His black [[belt]] had a golden buckle and a [[holster]]<ref name="Updated and Expanded" /> for his [[SE-14C blaster pistol]]<ref name="A New Hope" /> When operating, Evazan wore scrubs and used a variety of medical instruments.<ref name="Dr. Evazan">{{FFGTCG|set=A Wretched Hive (Star Wars: The Card Game)|cardname=Dr. Evazan|link=a-wretched-hive/dr-evazan-r1816}}</ref> During his servitude at the Accresker Jail, Evazan wore dark brown leather [[clothing]] with a large hood and compartments around the waist, an outfit worn by all prisoners at Accresker Jail.<ref name="Aphra 20" />

==Behind the scenes==
===Conception and portrayal===
[[File:Evazan_makeup.png|thumb|right|250px|Alfie Curtis has his makeup applied by a member of the art department, transforming him into Cornelius Evazan.]]
Cornelius Evazan first appeared in the [[1977]] film [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']],<ref name="A New Hope" /> in which he was played by [[Alfie Curtis]].<ref name="The Art of Star Wars">''[[The Art of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]''</ref> The original [[1976]] [[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (novel)|novelization]] of ''[[Star Wars]]'', ghostwritten by [[Alan Dean Foster]], described the character as a "short, grubby-looking human" with a surprisingly deep voice. This story's version of events,<ref name="Novelization">[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (novel)|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'' novelization]]</ref> which closely matches the film's revised fourth draft,<ref name="Revised Fourth Draft">{{Cite_web|url=http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Star-Wars-A-New-Hope.html|title=Star Wars: A New Hope Script at IMSDb|accessdate=2017-09-13|work=[http://www.imsdb.com/ The Internet Movie Script Database]|publisher=imsdb.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913065016/http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Star-Wars-A-New-Hope.html|archivedate=2017-09-13}}</ref> describes Obi-Wan Kenobi as cutting off Evazan's arm, rather than Ponda Baba's, with Evazan retreating into the crowd without a word following the fight.<ref name="Novelization" /> The Evazan character dates back as early as ''[[The Star Wars: Rough Draft]]'' from [[May (month)|May]] [[1974]].<ref name="The Making of Star Wars">''[[The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film]]''</ref>

''Star Wars'' creature effects make-up artist [[Nick Maley]] was displeased with Evazan's distinctive facial prosthetic. He felt that the prosthetic's texture did not work well with that of Curtis' face.<ref name="Yahoo!

In ''Rogue One'', the character was portrayed by [[Michael Smiley]], who is credited as "Dr. Evazan."<ref name="Rogue One" /> ''Rogue One'' writer [[Gary Whitta]] disagreed with Evazan and Baba's inclusion in the film, opining that he "thought having Evazan and Walrus Man was a little too much. You have to reign in that instinct to go back and put things in just because you loved them when you were a kid."<ref name="Entertainment Weekly">{{Cite_web |url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/03/24/rogue-one-revisions-tie-fighter-scene-deleted-planet-killed-cameos/ |title=''Rogue One'' revisions: The TIE fighter scene, a deleted planet, and killed cameos |accessdate=2017-12-04 |author=Anthony Breznican |last= |first= |authorlink=http://ew.com/author/anthony-breznican/ |coauthors= |date=2017-03-24 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |pages= |language= |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20171203190336/http://ew.com/movies/2017/03/24/rogue-one-revisions-tie-fighter-scene-deleted-planet-killed-cameos/ |archivedate=2017-12-03 |quote="I thought having Evazan and Walrus Man was a little too much," Whitta says. "You have to reign in that instinct to go back and put things in just because you loved them when you were a kid."}}</ref>

===Character development===
The character's name originates in [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] storytelling, as he was first referred to as "Roofoo" in [[Brian Daley]]'s [[1981]] [[Star Wars (radio)|''Star Wars'' radio dramatization]].<ref name="Radio drama">[[Star Wars (radio)|''Star Wars'' radio drama]]</ref> The name "Evazan" originated in ''[[Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope]]'', a [[1989]] ''[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game]]'' supplement written by [[Michael Stern]] and [[Grant S. Boucher]].<ref name="Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope">''[[Galaxy Guide 1: A New Hope]]''</ref> "[[Doctor Death: The Tale of Dr. Evazan and Ponda Baba]]," a short story written by [[Kenneth C. Flint]] for the [[1995]] anthology book ''[[Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina]]'', created the name "Cornelius" as an alias of Evazan's,<ref name="Doctor Death">{{Shortstory|story=Doctor Death: The Tale of Dr. Evazan and Ponda Baba|book=Tales from the Mos Eisley Cantina}}</ref> while [[The Official Star Wars Fact File 51|''The Official Star Wars Fact File'' 51]] from [[2002]] was the first source to establish the character's full name as Cornelius Evazan.<ref name="OFF">{{FFCite|51|CAN11, ''Cornelius Evazan''}}</ref> The original [[StarWars.com]] [[Databank (original)|Databank]] later established "Roofoo" as another of Evazan's aliases.<ref name="Doctor Evazan">{{DB|character|doctorevazan|Evazan, Doctor|archivedate=20100210023915}}</ref>

[[File:Evazan_and_Baba.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Doctor Evazan and the armless Ponda Baba pose on the cantina set.]]
In the new ''Star Wars'' [[canon]], Cornelius Evazan's name was used in the [[Video game|mobile card game]] ''[[Star Wars: Force Collection]]'',<ref name="Force Collection">{{ForceCollection|Dr. Evazan|star=1}}</ref> which initially launched on [[September 4]], [[2013]]. Although the launch of ''Force Collection'' predates<ref name="Force Collection release">{{SW|url=news/announcing-star-wars-force-collection|text=Announcing Star Wars: Force Collection|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113224116/http://www.starwars.com/news/announcing-star-wars-force-collection}}</ref> the ''Star Wars'' canon reset of [[April 25]], [[2014]],<ref name="Legends">{{SW|url=news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page|text=The Legendary Star Wars Expanded Universe Turns a New Page|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113224347/http://www.starwars.com/news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page}}</ref> [[Lucasfilm Story Group]] member [[Leland Chee]] confirmed that the game was kept updated to fit with canon.<ref name="Twitter">{{Twitter|holocronkeeper|status/846807700482666496|[[Leland Chee]]|quote=I'm not gonna go through the trouble of changing them and I don't have any reason to believe currently that anyone would.

===Inconsistencies===
Both the Cornelius Evazan and Ponda Baba StarWars.com [[Databank (website)|Databank]] entries claim that Evazan died following his confrontation with Obi-Wan Kenobi,<ref name="Doctor Cornelius Evazan" /><ref name="Ponda Baba" /> but the 2016 ''[[Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded]]'', written by Pablo Hidalgo, states that Evazan survived the encounter.<ref name="Updated and Expanded" /> The short story "[[The Secrets of Long Snoot]]," included in the [[2017]] anthology ''[[From a Certain Point of View]]'', also presented Evazan as surviving his encounter with Kenobi.<ref name="The Secrets of Long Snoot" /> ''Updated and Expanded'' also states that Evazan is 1.77 meters tall,<ref name="Updated and Expanded" /> while the character's Databank entry provides a height of 1.7 meters.<ref name="Doctor Cornelius Evazan" /> This article presents the information from ''Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded'' and "The Secrets of Long Snoot" as more recent sources.

Several sources, including the Mos Eisley Cantina and Tatooine StarWars.com Databank entries and the junior novel ''[[The Weapon of a Jedi: A Luke Skywalker Adventure]]'', mistakenly identify Evazan as an [[alien]].<ref name="Mos Eisley Cantina" /><ref name="The Weapon of a Jedi" /><ref name="Tatooine">{{Databank|tatooine|Tatooine}}</ref>
