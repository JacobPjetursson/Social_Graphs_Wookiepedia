{{Quote|FN-2003 must stand or fall on his own. If he stands, the Order is strengthened. If he falls, the Order is spared his weakness.|Captain Phasma|Before the Awakening}}
'''FN-2003''', nicknamed "'''Slip'''," was a [[First Order]] [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtrooper]] who served in the [[Standard decade|decades]] following the [[Galactic Civil War]]. He served under [[Finn|FN-2187]] and was considered the weakest link of their group, and his ineptitude was symbolically used in a speech by [[Captain]] [[Phasma]] to 2187, in which she reinforced that the weakness of individuals contributed to the potential weakness of the First Order as a whole. Despite his failures, Slip continued to serve on the front lines until [[Attack on Tuanul|an assault]] on the [[Sacred Villages|village]] [[Tuanul]] on [[Jakku]], thirty years after the [[Battle of Endor]].

==Biography==
FN-2003 was a [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtrooper]] who served in the [[First Order]] in the [[Standard decade|decades]] after the [[Galactic Civil War]]. [[Sexes|He]] frequently fell behind the rest of his [[FN Corps|team]], led by [[Finn|FN-2187]], during their training simulations, leading to his nickname of "Slip." FN-2187 often had to rescue Slip in those simulations, including in one where the team assaulted a [[New Republic]] bunker with the objective of destroying a [[heavy repeating blaster]]. Slip was reprimanded by [[Captain]] [[Phasma]] after the simulation ended, and Phasma further ordered FN-2187 to stop rescuing Slip. As Phasma explained, Slip was the weakest link and helping him would weaken the First Order. During a [[Strike at Pressy's Tumble|strike]] at [[Pressy's Tumble]], Slip redeemed himself in Phasma's [[eye]]s by [[Death|executing]] an [[Abednedo (species)|Abednedo]] negotiator.<ref name="BTA" />

During a First Order [[Attack on Tuanul|raid]] on [[Tuanul|a]] [[Sacred Villages|sacred village]] on the [[planet]] [[Jakku]], Slip was hit by [[blaster]] [[fire]] from [[Poe Dameron]]. FN-2187 went to help his squadmate, but FN-2003's wound proved fatal, Slip wiping his [[blood]]y hand on FN-2187's [[First Order stormtrooper armor|helmet]] before dying. His sudden and violent death contributed to FN-2187's decision to escape from First Order service.<ref name="TFA VD" /><ref name="Episode VII" />

FN-2003 first appeared in the [[2015]] film [[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']].<ref name="Episode VII" /> He was not named in the film itself, only in the novel ''[[Before the Awakening]]'', written by [[Greg Rucka]] and released the same day as the movie.<ref name="BTA" /> FN-2003's appearance in ''The Force Awakens'' was confirmed in the ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary]]''.<ref name="TFA VD" /> He was portrayed by [[Pip Andersen]] in the film, listed in the end credits as "Lead Stormtrooper".
