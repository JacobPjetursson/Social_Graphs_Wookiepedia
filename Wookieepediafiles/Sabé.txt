{{Quote|This is my decoy, my protection&hellip;my loyal bodyguard.|Padmé Amidala, introducing Sabé to Rugor Nass|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace}}
'''Sabé''' ({{Pronounced|sɑ'beɪ}}) was a [[human]] [[Sexes|female]] who [[Homeworld|hailed]] from the [[planet]] [[Naboo]] during the [[Fall of the Republic|late era]] of the [[Galactic Republic]]. Serving as a [[Naboo Royal Handmaidens|handmaiden]] in the [[Royal House of Naboo]], Sabé was duty-bound to protect [[Queen]] [[Padmé Amidala]]&mdash;the [[Democracy|elected]] [[Monarch of Naboo|ruler]] of the [[Naboo (people)|people of Naboo]]&mdash;against any threat. As such, she impersonated Amidala during the [[Invasion of Naboo]] in order to keep her safe from the [[Trade Federation]].

Sabé continued to act as a decoy queen after the [[Jedi]] [[ambassador]]s [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] [[Capture of Theed|rescued]] the true Amidala as well as her royal retinue. Upon returning to Naboo from [[Coruscant]], the [[capital]] world of the [[Galactic Republic]], Sabé was introduced as Queen Amidala to the [[Gungan]] [[Species|people]]. Hoping to forge an alliance between Gungans and the Naboo, the real Amidala identified herself to [[Boss]] [[Rugor Nass]]&mdash;leader of the Gungans&mdash;and thereby revealed Sabé's true role as the queen's handmaiden, decoy and loyal [[bodyguard]].

Sabé continued to wear her [[Clothing|disguise]] during the [[Battle of Naboo]]. Storming the [[Theed Royal Palace|Royal Palace]] in [[Theed]], the decoy caught the attention of [[Viceroy]] [[Nute Gunray]], who ordered his [[battle droid]]s to pursue Sabé, believing her to be the real queen. As a result, Amidala and [[Captain]] [[Quarsh Panaka]] were able to secure the [[Throne room (Theed Royal Palace)|throne room]] and [[Prisoner|capture]] Gunray. Ultimately, the battle concluded in victory for both the [[Royal Naboo Security Forces]] and the [[Gungan Grand Army]].

==Biography==
{{Quote|Viceroy! Your occupation here has ended.|Sabé, as Queen Amidala|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace}}
Sabé was one of five [[Naboo Royal Handmaidens|handmaidens]] that served [[Monarch of Naboo|Queen]] [[Padmé Amidala|Amidala]] during the [[Trade Federation]]'s [[blockade]] and subsequent [[Invasion of Naboo|invasion]] of [[Naboo]]. When Federation forces captured the [[Theed Royal Palace]], Sabé switched roles with the [[queen]], who posed as a simple handmaiden, going by her less commonly known name, Padmé. Sabé, pretending to be the queen, rejected [[Viceroy of the Trade Federation|Viceroy]] [[Nute Gunray]]'s efforts to have her sign a treaty that would make the invasion legal. She and the rest of the royal retinue were then escorted by [[B1 battle droid|battle droids]] to a separate holding facility.<ref name="Episode I" />

On the way, they were rescued by [[Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and his [[Padawan]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]. Proceeding to a nearby [[hangar]], Jinn insisted that the queen be taken to [[Coruscant]] to plead her case to the [[Galactic Senate]]. After conferring with her handmaiden Padmé, the real queen, Sabé agreed. She subsequently left Naboo aboard the [[Naboo Royal Starship|Royal Starship]] with the [[Jedi]], taking Padmé, [[Captain]] [[Quarsh Panaka|Panaka]], as well as two other handmaidens, [[Eirtaé]] and [[Rabé]], with her.<ref name="Episode I" />

They eventually managed to get through the Federation blockade and leave the [[Naboo system]]. Sabé&mdash;as the queen&mdash;commended [[R2-D2]], the [[astromech droid]] that guaranteed their [[Starship|ship's]] escape, and ordered Padmé to clean him up. However, the Royal Starship's [[hyperdrive]] was heavily damaged. Forced to land on the [[desert]] [[planet]] [[Tatooine]], Sabé remained on the starship while Jinn and Padmé sought a new [[T-14 hyperdrive generator]].<ref name="Episode I" />

When they reached the [[The galaxy|galactic]] [[capital]] of Coruscant, Sabé was presented as the queen to [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Finis Valorum|Valorum]] and [[Senator]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]], who represented Naboo in the Galactic Congress. She then switched back with the queen, and attended to Amidala before she went to speak to the Senate.<ref name="Episode I" />

[[File:Nottonyscott.JPG|thumb|250px|left|During the Naboo crisis, Sabé served as a decoy for Queen Amidala.]]
Sabé once again switched places with Amidala when they sought help from [[Gungan]] [[Gungan Grand Army|forces]], and began negotiations with their leader, [[Boss]] [[Rugor Nass|Nass]]. However, Padmé quickly revealed the deception as a confidence-building measure, and the two parties finally agreed to work together in order to free their planet from the Trade Federation. Despite being exposed, Sabé remained disguised as Queen Amidala during the [[Battle of Naboo|mission]] to reclaim the palace. When Padmé was [[Prisoner|captured]], she played an instrumental role in deceiving [[Viceroy]] Gunray. Showing up suddenly at the door to the throne room, Sabe proclaimed the Viceroy's occupation over and blasted two of his droids before fleeing with her group. Gunray ordered his [[troop]]s to follow Sabé, believing she was the real queen. This provided Padmé the opportunity to retrieve her [[blaster]] and take the [[Neimoidian]] into custody, liberating the planet.<ref name="Episode I" />

Sabé was later present when the queen welcomed Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and the [[Jedi High Council|Jedi Council]] to Naboo, and at the parade celebrating the freedom of Naboo and the reconciliation of its human and Gungan populations.<ref name="Episode I" /> By [[22 BBY]], the handmaiden [[Cordé]] had taken on the role of Amidala's decoy.<ref name="Episode II">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]</ref>

[[File:Sabeandpadmeaccentsgalore.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Sabé impersonated Queen Amidala to keep her sovereign from harm.]]
Sabé was loyal to Queen Amidala, serving as both her [[bodyguard]] and decoy in crisis situations, despite the considerable risk of injury, capture or even death that this posed to her. As a member of Amidala's royal retinue of handmaidens, Sabé was handpicked to aid the Queen of Naboo. Like all Naboo handmaidens, she learned self-defense and was also trained to remain vigilant against all threats to her monarch.<ref name="HandmaidensDB">{{Databank|naboo-royal-handmaidens|Naboo Royal Handmaidens}}</ref> When impersonating the Queen, Sabé and Amidala, who disguised herself as a handmaiden, relied on a system of subtle signals in order to secretly communicate without undermining the deception of their switched roles.<ref name="SabéDB" />

Like Amidala,<ref name="PadméDB">{{Databank|padme-amidala|Padmé Amidala}}</ref> Sabé was a [[human]] [[Sexes|female]] who stood at 1.65 [[meter]]s.<ref name="SabéDB" /> She had [[Color|brown]] [[hair]], brown [[eye]]s, and light skin. She carried a standard [[ELG-3A blaster pistol]] like the queen and her fellow handmaidens and was a capable markswoman, taking off the head of a battle droid at one point with a single shot.<ref name="Episode I" />

==Behind the scenes==
Sabé first appeared in the [[1999]] film [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']], portrayed by [[Wikipedia:English people|English]] actress [[Keira Knightley]].<ref name="Episode I" /> She was credited as "Kiera Knightley" in the film.<ref name="Episode I" /> Sabé was originally going to be filled by a [[Wikipedia:Stand-in|stand-in]], until casting director [[Robin Gurland]] came across Knightley, who bore a striking resemblance to [[Natalie Portman]], the actress playing the role of Padmé Amidala in the film. Knightley's role was kept quiet by ''The Phantom Menace''{{'s}} marketing department in order to heighten the surprise of there being a decoy queen when the film was released and the queen's costumes were specifically designed to hide any height and shape differences between Portman and Knightley, so much so that Portman's mother couldn't distinguish between the two on set.<ref name="ak">{{InsiderCite|75|Appearing Knightley (and the Women of Star Wars)|Appearing Knightley (and the Women of ''Star Wars'')}}</ref>
