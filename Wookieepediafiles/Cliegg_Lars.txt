{{Quote|Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife.|Cliegg Lars introduces himself to Anakin Skywalker, his stepson|Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones}}
'''Cliegg Lars''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] [[moisture farmer]] from [[Tatooine]]. He had one son, [[Owen Lars]], from his first marriage. In the [[Standard year|years]] prior to the [[Clone Wars]], he met [[Shmi Skywalker Lars|Shmi Skywalker]] and freed her from [[slavery]] before marrying her. As such, he was the step-father of [[Anakin Skywalker]], and the step-grandfather of [[Luke Skywalker]] and [[Leia Organa]].

Shortly before the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Shmi was captured by a band of [[Tusken Raider]]s. Lars and a number of other moisture farmers attempted to save her, but the sand people drove them back, and Lars lost his right leg as a result. Anakin Skywalker later arrived on Tatooine, having had visions through [[the Force]] of Shmi's suffering and met Lars. Skywalker found his mother, but she died in his arms and he returned her body to the [[Lars moisture farm]] for burial, where Lars said goodbye to his wife before dying sometime later.

==Biography==
{{Quote|Thirty of us went out after her. Four of us came back. I'd be with them, only&hellip; after I lost my leg I just couldn't ride any more, until I heal. I don't want to give up on her, but she's been gone a month. There's little hope she's lasted this long.|Cliegg Lars tells Anakin Skywalker about his mother|Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones}}
Cliegg Lars was born on [[Tatooine]] to [[Gredda Lars|Gredda]] and [[Lef Lars]]. He had a brother named [[Edern Lars|Edern]], but he [[Death|died]] at the age of fourteen in a [[landspeeder]] accident.<ref name="SW:CL">''[[Star Wars: Complete Locations (2016)|Star Wars: Complete Locations]]''</ref> When Cliegg grew up, he became a moisture farmer.<ref name="Encyclopedia" /> He lived on his [[Lars moisture farm|family's homestead]] near the settlement of [[Anchorhead]].<ref name="Encyclopedia" /> He married a woman named [[Aika Lars|Aika]] and together they had a son, [[Owen Lars|Owen]]. However, Aika died and Cliegg and Owen continued to run the homestead.<ref name="Character Encyclopedia">''[[Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded]]''</ref> Later on, Owen's girlfriend, [[Beru Whitesun Lars|Beru Whitesun]], lived with them on the farm.<ref name="Episode II" />

A few years before the [[Clone Wars]], Lars took a trip to the spaceport settlement of [[Mos Espa]], where he met [[Shmi Skywalker Lars|Shmi Skywalker]], a slave owned by [[Watto]], a [[Toydarian]] junk dealer. Lars fell in love with Shmi and bought her from Watto,<ref name="Encyclopedia" /> thus freeing her from slavery. The two married and lived together as husband and wife for many years. Approximately one month before the [[Battle of Geonosis]], however, Shmi was kidnapped by a group of [[Tusken Raider]]s. An enraged Lars gathered dozens of other farmers and set out to rescue his wife. Although thirty farmers went out looking for her, only four returned alive. Lars himself returned maimed, having lost his right leg to the sand people.<ref name="Episode II" />

A month after Shmi's disappearance, her son, [[Jedi]] [[Padawan]] [[Anakin Skywalker]] arrived on the farm looking for her, having had [[The Force|Force]] visions of her suffering. Lars and his [[Lars family|family]] met Skywalker for the first time and explained to him what had happened with the Tusken Raiders. Although Lars told his stepson to accept that Shmi was gone, Skywalker was determined to find his mother and set out into the desert to locate the sand people. He found them and his mother, but she died in his arms. Skywalker returned to the farm after slaughtering the Tusken Raiders for revenge, and, along with Lars and his family, buried Shmi on the farm next to Lars's brother and parents.<ref name="SWCT">[[Star Wars: Card Trader|''Star Wars'': Card Trader]]</ref> Skywalker left shortly thereafter, leaving the Lars family behind.<ref name="Episode II" /> Soon after these events, Cliegg died, passing on the moisture farm to his son and his daughter-in-law [[Beru Whitesun Lars|Beru]].<ref name="Ultimate SW" />
