{{Quote|Yub nub!|Wicket W. Warrick|Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi}}
'''Wicket W. Warrick''' was a [[Sexes|male]] [[Ewok]] [[scout]] and warrior on the [[Endor|forest moon]] of [[Endor (planet)|Endor]]. Wicket also played an instrumental role in helping the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] defeat the [[Galactic Empire]] during the [[Battle of Endor]].

==Biography==
When Wicket was still a young warrior,<ref name="Databank" /> the [[Galactic Empire]] ruled by [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]] landed on [[Endor]] to construct a [[Death Star's shield generator|shield generator]] to protect their [[Death Star II|second Death Star]].<ref name="ROTJ" /> Despite the disparity in technology and [[fire]]power between the [[Ewok]]s and the [[Imperial Military|Imperial forces]], Wicket devised plans for defeating the Imperial war machines.<ref name="Databank" />

===Rebel encounters===
{{Quote|You're a jittery little thing, aren't you?|[[Leia Organa]]|Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi}}
[[File:Leia Wicket.png|thumb|left|250px|Wicket meets Princess Leia Organa.]]
The Imperial activity continued on Endor as construction on the new [[Death]] [[Star]] progressed. Meanwhile, the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] had sent a [[Endor strike team|strike team]] to the [[forest]] [[moon]] to deactivate the [[Deflector shield generator|shield]] protecting the giant [[Superweapon|weapon]]. One [[Standard day|day]], Wicket came across the crash site of a pair of Imperial [[74-Z speeder bike|speeder bikes]]. [[Sexes|He]] cautiously approached the only survivor, a [[human]] woman, prodding her with his [[spear]] until she regained consciousness. This woman was [[Leia Organa]], [[Prince]]ss of [[Alderaan]] and a leader of the Rebel Alliance.<ref name="ROTJ" />

Wicket remained leery until the woman offered him some [[Foodstuff|food]] to [[Diet|eat]]. He found the food to be very good, but he again became fearful of Organa, though she was merely removing her helmet. He began to inspect the headgear but stopped and grabbed his spear when he heard more Imperials. When the Imperial [[scout trooper]]s fired at them, Wicket and Organa hid behind a log until another blast hit. At that point Wicket rolled out of sight. Then, as a [[scout]] [[trooper]] approached Organa at gunpoint, Wicket realized she was no friend of the Imperials, so he attacked the trooper's [[Limb|legs]], giving Organa a chance to swing at the trooper, grab her [[blaster]], and shoot the other Imperial before he could get away. As they headed off, Wicket urged Organa to follow him to his home [[Bright Tree Village|village]].<ref name="ROTJ" />

On the way home, Wicket and Leia came upon two [[stormtrooper]]s who had stopped two other Ewoks and were attempting to arrest them. Wicket climbed a nearby [[tree]] and created a trap by tying a lasso from a vine. He then lowered the lasso over the stormtroopers, snaring them. Wicket jumped from the tree, holding the other end of the vine in order to hang the stormtroopers from the tree; however, Wicket was not heavy enough to pull the stormtroopers. Organa assisted, grabbing hold of Wicket, causing the stormtroopers to rise and be knocked unconscious by a tree branch. Wicket, Organa, and the two other Ewoks continued to Bright Tree Village. Upon arriving at the village, Wicket presented Organa with a [[Clothing|dress]] as a gift for helping him save his fellow villagers.<ref name="Ewok Escape">{{FOD|Ewok Escape}}</ref>

Meanwhile, other Ewoks had captured and brought in the rest of the Rebels: [[Luke Skywalker]], [[Han Solo]], [[Chewbacca]], and the [[droid]]s [[R2-D2]] and [[C-3PO]]. The Ewoks treated C-3PO as a [[Deity|god]], and the Ewok [[shaman]] [[Logray]] insisted that the other Rebels be sacrificed in the droid's honor. The proceedings were halted when Skywalker used [[the Force]] to [[Telekinesis|lift]] C-3PO into the air and convince the Ewoks that it was a show of the droid's "magic." This frightened the Ewoks, including Wicket, and caused them to run away, but they soon returned and untied the Rebels under Logray's orders. Once freed, R2-D2 used one of his [[Arc welder|built-in devices]] to deliver a mild electrical shock to Wicket in retaliation.<ref name="ROTJ" />

===The Battle of Endor===
That night, the Rebels had an audience with the Ewok leaders in hopes of encouraging them to join their cause. C-3PO animatedly told the Rebels' tale. At the end of the meeting [[Chief]] [[Chirpa]] declared that the Rebels would become part of their [[Bright Tree tribe|tribe]]. Wicket embraced [[Captain]] Solo as the Ewoks welcomed their new comrades.<ref name="ROTJ" />

[[File:Wicket and Rebels.png|right|thumb|250px|Wicket consults with [[Paploo]] about how to help Organa, Solo, and Chewbacca.]]
Wicket and another Ewok, [[Paploo]], then joined with Solo, Organa, Chewbacca, and the droids to meet up with the Rebel [[commando]]s. They arrived a ridge overlooking the Imperial landing platform, and from there Wicket and Paploo led them to a "secret" entrance on the other side of the ridge. There, as Paploo distracted the scout [[troop]]ers to allow the Rebels to sneak inside the [[SLD-26 planetary shield generator|shield generator]] bunker, Wicket stayed behind with the droids. He remained there until they spotted more Imperials arriving; realizing the Rebels were in trouble, Wicket ran to get help. After the Rebels were led back out of the bunker at gunpoint, Wicket returned&mdash;and he brought with him an entire army of Ewoks. The [[Battle of Endor]] had begun.<ref name="ROTJ" />

The Ewoks attacked with a variety of weapons and traps. Wicket joined a group hunting with bolas, and while his own attack backfired and knocked Wicket to the ground, the only injury was to his ego. The battle raged on, and the Rebels tried to make their way back into the bunker. The Rebels eventually destroyed the shield generator, allowing the [[Alliance Fleet|fleet]] above the [[planet]] to destroy the Death Star, and the body of Emperor Palpatine along with it. As the victors celebrated on Endor, Solo and Organa shared an intimate moment&mdash;one which Wicket didn't hesitate interrupting to share in the jubilation.<ref name="ROTJ" />

===After the battle===
At a village-wide party where the Ewoks and Rebels celebrated their victory in the battle, Wicket danced and fraternized with R2-D2.<ref name="ROTJ" /> When the Alliance detected [[Imperial outpost (Endor)|Imperial holdouts]] on the other side of the moon, Wicket and at least five other Ewoks accompanied the [[Pathfinders|strike team]] out to the site. The Ewoks' curiosity about all the technology and buttons within the [[shuttle]] got on the nerves of [[pilot]] [[Shara Bey]] as she was flying the craft. The strike team quickly [[Assault on an Imperial outpost|took]] the base and discovered numerous Imperial comm records and plans in the wake of the Emperor's death.<ref name="SE">''[[Shattered Empire, Part I]]''</ref> Wicket gave Organa an acorn for a [[Sanctuary tree|serpent's puzzle]] [[plant]] as a gift before she left Endor. At Skywalker's suggestion, the sapling became a part of her [[meditation]] exercises.<ref name="Life Debt">''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]''</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
Wicket was portrayed by [[Warwick Davis]] in [[1983]]'s ''[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]''. The then 11-year-old actor came to be involved in the film after his grandmother heard a radio ad calling for short actors.<ref name="Insider31">{{InsiderCite|31|Wicket Unleashed}}</ref> When Davis' mother called to inquire on his behalf, she was told that [[Lucasfilm Ltd.|Lucasfilm]] already had enough actors; however, when she mentioned that Warwick was a mere 2 feet, 11 inches tall, they reconsidered him as a possibility for a younger Ewok. Davis then met with production assistant Pat Carr at [[Elstree Studios]], where he was measured for a costume and didn't even have to audition.<ref name="Insider67">{{InsiderCite|67|Beyond the Valley of the Ewoks}}</ref> Davis began work on the film in [[January]] [[1982]]. Originally just another Ewok, Davis caught the eye of [[George Lucas]] with aspects of his performance, such as his interaction with R2-D2 and the ability to stick his tongue through his Ewok mask.<ref name="Insider31" /> Another part of his performance, inquisitively tilting his head, was inspired by Davis' dog.<ref name="Insider67" />

Davis was later taken to America for location shooting. The day [[Kenny Baker]] was supposed to shoot the scene in which his character (originally called "Wicket") meets Princess Leia for the first time, Baker fell ill with food poisoning, and so Davis was called in as a replacement.<ref name="Insider67" /> Davis' Ewok eventually became "Wicket," while Baker's became "Paploo."<ref name="ROTJ" /> Evidence of the switch remains in the [[Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (comics)|comic book adaptation of ''Return of the Jedi'']], where the Ewok stealing the speeder bike is still called Wicket. As for Wicket's voice in the final film, according to Davis, it was performed by an unnamed [[Wikipedia:Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] woman.<ref name="Insider39">{{InsiderCite|39|When Artoo Met Wicket}}</ref> Since George Lucas' daughter [[Amanda Lucas|Amanda]] was a big fan of Wicket, Davis performed the character at a birthday party for her, delivering presents and even letting the kids force-feed him cake.<ref name="Insider62">{{InsiderCite|62|Return to Endor}}</ref>

Concurrent to the shooting of ''Return of the Jedi'', first assistant director [[David Tomblin]] shot a short film on [[Wikipedia:16 mm film|16 mm film]] starring Davis called ''[[Return of the Ewok]]''. It tells an alternate tale of Warwick Davis landing the role of an Ewok and the trying to find his way to the "green moon of Endor", stopping by [[Jabba's Palace]] and [[Yoda]]'s hut along the way. Davis is in his Wicket costume for much of the film. A short clip, where [[Boba Fett]] is pursuing Davis/Wicket on the second Death Star, can be seen in the blooper reel easter egg on the [[2004]] bonus [[Star Wars home video releases|DVD]] for the [[original trilogy]].<ref name="Insider46">{{InsiderCite|46|Return of the Ewok (article)|Return of the Ewok}}</ref>

Wicket's [[Star Wars Legends|Expanded Universe]] appearances, which are no longer considered [[canon]], included the television movies ''[[Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure]]'' ([[1984]]) and ''[[Ewoks: The Battle for Endor]]'' ([[1985]]), in which Davis reprised his role. Wicket was also a main character in the animated television series ''[[Star Wars: Ewoks]]'' from 1985–[[1986]], a related [[Ewoks (Marvel)|14-issue comic book series]] from [[Marvel Comics|Marvel's]] [[Star Comics]] imprint, and a number of [[:Category:Ewok Adventure books|children's books]]. The animated series and comics introduced Wicket's family and friends, including his love interest [[Kneesaa a Jari Kintaka|Princess Kneesaa]], daughter of Chief Chirpa. ''[[The Essential Guide to Characters]]'' established that Wicket's middle name is Wystri.

On the April 27, 2008 edition of Comedy Central's ''Colbert Report'', Stephen Colbert (a self-described geek) "ate" Wicket (a large teddy bear with an apple stuffed in its mouth), reneging on a promise not to eat Ewok.

On June 7, 2013, it was announced that, in honor of the 30th anniversary of ''Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi''{{'s}} release, Bean Bunny was selected to represent Wicket Warrick for the ''Star Wars''/''The Muppets'' crossover line.<ref name="30th Anniversary special">{{EndorExpress|2013/06/star-wars-muppets-bean-bunny/|Star Wars Muppets: Bean Bunny}}</ref>

In the animated microseries ''[[Star Wars: Forces of Destiny]]'', the voice of Wicket is provided by [[Dee Bradley Baker]].<ref name="Vol 1">''[[Star Wars: Forces of Destiny: Volume 1]] Credits''</ref>
