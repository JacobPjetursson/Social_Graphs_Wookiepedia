{{Quote|We weren't prepared for anything like this.|U.O. Statura, on Resistance casualties, during the assault on Starkiller Base|Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)}}
'''U.O. Statura''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] [[admiral]] and senior [[Resistance officer|officer]] with the [[Resistance]]. Statura [[Homeworld|hailed]] from the [[planet]] [[Garel]] and had a scientific background.

Statura correctly predicted the attack on Starkiller Base would be successful if the Resistance crippled its [[thermal oscillator‎]], which led to the destruction of the superweapon.
