[[Baron/Legends|Baron]] '''Notluwiski Papanoida''' was a [[Pantoran/Legends|Pantoran]] statesman and playwright<ref name="DBPapanoida">{{DB|character|baronpapanoida|Baron Papanoida}}</ref> who lived during the final decades of the Galactic Republic. He succeeded [[Chi Cho/Legends|Chi Cho]] as the [[Chairman/Legends|Chairman]] of the [[Pantoran Assembly/Legends|Pantoran Assembly]] during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]].<ref name="Encyclopedia" /> Father to a Republic [[Senator/Legends|Senator]], [[Chi Eekway Papanoida/Legends|Chi Eekway]], Baron Papanoida was an influential figure in [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] affairs, a well-known intelligence provider, anti-[[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatinist]], and lover of the performance arts&mdash;he was known to frequent the finest auditoriums and holo-entertainment venues, including the [[Galaxies Opera House/Legends|Galaxies Opera House]] in the [[Uscru Entertainment District/Legends|Uscru Entertainment District]].<ref name="DBPapanoida" />

==Biography==
[[File:PapanoidaPantoraOffice-SoI.png|left|thumb|200px|Chairman Papanoida working in his office on Pantora]]
Papanoida fathered several children, including [[Ion Papanoida/Legends|Ion]], [[Che Amanwe Papanoida/Legends|Che Amanwe]], and [[Chi Eekway Papanoida/Legends|Chi Eekway]]. Papanoida was once a humble playwright on his homeworld of [[Pantora/Legends|Pantora]], and had a number of hits that became immensely popular among his people. The success of his plays helped fund Papanoida's growing entertainment empire, and Papanoida himself became an influential trade guild baron. He kept much of his past shrouded in mystery, so it was not known how [[Baron/Legends|Baron]] Papanoida was able to cultivate his information network that some claimed even rivaled the famed [[Bothan Spynet]]. He spent some time working in the [[Wroonian]] [[Holodrama/Legends|holodrama]] industry and during that period, he acquired and refurbished the [[Rainhawk-class transport/Legends|''Rainhawk''-class transport]] ''[[Falfa/Legends|Falfa]]''.<ref name="Incredible Vehicles">''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Incredible Vehicles]]''</ref>

After the death of [[Chairman/Legends|Chairman]] [[Chi Cho/Legends|Chi Cho]] during a [[Battle of Orto Plutonia/Legends|conflict]] on the ice moon of [[Orto Plutonia/Legends|Orto Plutonia]], Papanoida was appointed as the new chairman. When the [[Trade Federation/Legends|Trade Federation]] blockaded [[Pantora/Legends|Pantora]], public unrest threatened to force the moon to secede from the Republic and join the Separatists, who were offering aid. Papanoida relied on Senator [[Riyo Chuchi/Legends|Riyo Chuchi]] to plead for assistance in the Senate in ending the blockade. However, the Federation had his two daughters kidnapped as leverage. Papanoida could guess that his daughters might be on the [[Unidentified Lucrehulk-class Droid Control Ship (Pantora)|Droid Control Ship]] blockading Pantora and dispatched Chuchi and [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] [[Ahsoka Tano/Legends|Ahsoka Tano]] to go there under the pretense of a diplomatic mission, while he and his son Ion do their own investigation. Whereas the [[Coruscant Security Force/Legends|Coruscant Security Force]] failed to find any clues in his quarters, Papanoida discovered that one of his idols was misplaced and smeared with blood. Analyzing the blood, he found that it belonged to a [[Rodian/Legends|Rodian]] [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] named [[Greedo/Legends|Greedo]].

[[File:PapanoidaTheCloneWars.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Papanoida battles thugs holding his daughter hostage on Tatooine]]
The Pantorans traveled to the [[Jabba's Palace/Legends|palace]] of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure]] on [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]], whom Greedo was employed by. Papanoida was able to draw the Rodian out by simply telling a female [[Twi'lek/Legends|Twi'lek]] that they were looking for him. As expected, Greedo came to the Pantorans and attempted to get rid of them, only for Papanoida to pull out a knife and hold it against Greedo's throat. Matters were brought before Jabba, whom Papanoida managed to reason with into assisting them, by comparing Greedo's blood to the sample he found on Coruscant. No sooner that Jabba permitted it did Greedo spill that he had Chi Eekway held in [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]]. The Pantorans forced Greedo to lead them to the [[Cantina/Legends|cantina]] where Eekway was being held. But things got tense, as Greedo's [[Gotal/Legends|Gotal]] partner began to question him. The Rodian turned on the Pantorans and fled the cantina, as all the patrons started firing on them. The Pantorans were able to dispatch all the assailants; Eekway even saved her father's life by shooting the Gotal when he attempted to kill Papanoida when his back was turned. The Pantorans returned to Coruscant as Chuchi and Tano rescued Che Amanwe from the Droid Control Ship. Because the Federation lacked leverage, they were forced to end the blockade of Pantora.

During the time of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], Papanoida made frequent visits to the Galaxies Opera House; his love of the performing arts was one of the few aspects of his life Papanoida did not keep hidden. Papanoida was present at a performance of [[Squid Lake/Legends|Squid Lake]] following the [[Battle of Coruscant/Legends|Battle of Coruscant]], which [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] also attended. Papanoida was an outspoken critic of Palpatine, though he did not concern himself with any overt political actions against the Chancellor, such as the growing [[Delegation of 2000]]. Papanoida instead relied on funneling information to [[Senator/Legends|Senators]] of conscience, including his young daughter Chi Eekway, who was the representative of Wroona.

Baron Papanoida served the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] as an intelligence agent, though there was some question as to the Baron's true allegiance&mdash;it was rumored that he was, in fact, a double agent, loyal only to himself. This may have explained why he informed the [[Jedi Council/Legends|Jedi Council]] that there was no [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Separatist]] presence on [[Utapau/Legends|Utapau]]: a claim [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] later proved false when he discovered the headquarters of [[General/Legends|General]] [[Grievous/Legends|Grievous]] in [[Pau City/Legends|Pau City]]. Papanoida did not comment on whether this was a genuine mistake or a deliberate omission&mdash;a stance that only added to his shifty reputation.

Thanks to his discretion towards his opposition of Palpatine, N. Papanoida was able to retain his standing as the Republic transitioned into the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|First Galactic Empire]].

==Behind the scenes==
Baron Papanoida was portrayed by ''[[Star Wars]]'' creator [[George Lucas]] in ''[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]''. This was his only appearance in any ''Star Wars'' film. The character later appeared in the ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' episode "[[Sphere of Influence]]" voiced by [[Corey Burton]], using a vocal performance based on Orson Welles' Harry Lime from the film ''The Third Man''.<ref>{{SWArchive|url=theclonewars/sphere_preview/index.html|text=George Lucas in Action in Star Wars: The Clone Wars!}}</ref>

George Lucas's earlier version of the character's name was "Baron Notluwiski," before being changed to Baron Papanoida. [[The Official Star Wars Fact File Part 32|''The Official Star Wars Fact File'' Part 32]] made it official that his first name is Notluwiski.

On the action figure of Baron Papanoida, the tip of his cane is in the shape of a [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]].

Papanoida was originally described as a Wroonian in his Databank entry on [[StarWars.com]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20051224032152/http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/baronpapanoida/index.html Old Databank entry] via the Wayback Machine</ref> His species was later changed to [[Pantoran/Legends|Pantoran]] following their creation for "[[Trespass]]" in the ''The Clone Wars'' television series.<ref name="DB" />
