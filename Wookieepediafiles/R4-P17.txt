During the battle, [[Jedi Knight]]s Obi-Wan Kenobi and [[Anakin Skywalker]] approached [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist]] [[general]] [[Grievous]]' [[flagship]], the ''[[Invisible Hand]]'', in an attempt to rescue the kidnapped [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]]. As the two Jedi neared the flagship they encountered attacks from [[Pistoeka sabotage droid]]s; during the attack, R4's dome was torn apart by a [[Pistoeka sabotage droid|buzz droid]], ending her career.<ref name="ROTS" />
