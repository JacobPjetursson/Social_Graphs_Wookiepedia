{{Quote|I wonder how many they'll send. We've got so much firepower in here, these walls are ray-shielded. They can't take this fort. It'll probably be, uh, fifty Jedi.

'''Oro Dassyne''' was a [[Sexes/Legends|male]] [[Koorivar/Legends|Koorivar]] who worked for the [[Corporate Alliance/Legends|Corporate Alliance]] and served as a [[General/Legends|general]] in the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] on the side of the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. Dassyne was initially stationed on [[Murkhana/Legends|Murkhana]] in [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]] when the Clone Wars began; however, he wanted to take part in the war, and requested that he be moved away from Murkhana, an isolated [[Planet/Legends|planet]]. Dassyne was sent to [[Bomis Koori IV]], where he created a stronghold he believed to be impervious. However, in [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]], two [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]], [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]], succeeded in breaching his [[Oro Dassyne's Bomis Koori IV fort|fortress]], and shut down the [[Ray shield/Legends|ray shields]], allowing [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Republic]] [[Starship/Legends|starships]] to [[Orbital bombardment/Legends|bombard]] the bulwark from [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]]. Dassyne was [[Death/Legends|killed]] in the [[Battle of Bomis Koori IV|battle]].

==Biography==
A [[Sexes/Legends|male]] [[Koorivar/Legends|Koorivar]] from [[Murkhana/Legends|Murkhana]], Oro Dassyne worked for the [[Corporate Alliance/Legends|Corporate Alliance]] as an [[Acquisitions Specialist]] and [[Special Markets Director]]. Dassyne enjoyed warfare, and took pleasure in using the Alliance's [[NR-N99 Persuader-class droid enforcer/Legends|NR-N99 ''Persuader''-class droid enforcers]] to collect payment from customers or to intimidate business rivals. Dassyne was later granted [[General/Legends|generalship]] by [[Passel Argente/Legends|Passel Argente]], [[Magistrate/Legends|Magistrate]] of the Corporate Alliance, who had been impressed with Dassyne's body of work.<ref name="Oro Dassyne in the Databank" />

Once the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]] broke out in [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]], Dassyne was stationed on Murkhana, headquarters of the Corporate Alliance, which had joined the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. However, Murkhana was very isolated, and, wishing to be involved in the fighting, Dassyne requested a transfer elsewhere. He was moved to [[Bomis Koori IV]], a colony [[Planet/Legends|world]] controlled by the Alliance that housed many [[Battle droid/Legends|battle droid]] [[Droid factory|factories]]. Dassyne used the war to add to his personal collection, taking valuable literature and artwork from conquered planets. However, Dassyne's demand to be in battle backfired when one of his horns&mdash;status symbols in Koorivar culture&mdash;was shattered. To cover this, Dassyne wore an enlarged miter.<ref name="Oro Dassyne in the Databank" />

All the while, Dassyne built up his arsenal on Bomis Koori IV, creating a [[Oro Dassyne's Bomis Koori IV fort|fort]] he believed to be impenetrable. Whereas in the past he had relied on clever strategy, Dassyne now depended solely on numbers and spent all his efforts on fortifying his stronghold with more weaponry.<ref name="NEGAS">''[[The New Essential Guide to Alien Species]]''</ref> In [[20 BBY/Legends|20 BBY]], the Confederacy of Independent Systems and the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] did [[Battle of Bomis Koori IV|battle]] on Bomis Koori IV. Dassyne was confident in his defenses, stating that the Republic would need at least one hundred [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] to conquer the planet.<ref name="Oro Dassyne in the Databank" />

However, the Republic was not so sure that Bomis Koori IV's defenses were impenetrable, and sent two Jedi, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]], along with a company of [[Clone trooper/Legends|clone troopers]], to take control of the planet. Skywalker and Kenobi succeeded in breaching the fortress's outer wall, and deactivated the [[Ray shield/Legends|ray shields]], allowing a [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] of [[Venator-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Venator''-class Star Destroyers]] to [[Orbital bombardment/Legends|bombard]] the fortress from [[Orbit/Legends|orbit]]. Dassyne was [[Death/Legends|killed]], and Bomis Koori IV fell.<ref name="Oro Dassyne in the Databank" />

Dassyne greatly enjoyed war, and wanted to be involved in the fighting at the front lines. He requested a transfer from Murkhana&mdash;which was located in the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim Territories]], far from the war&mdash;to a place where he could be more active in the fighting. However, he was overconfident, believing that he was invincible, and he lost his horn in a battle as a result of fighting in the vanguard.<ref name="Oro Dassyne in the Databank" /> While Dassyne initially relied on strategy rather than brute force, he later changed his style once he was stationed on Bomis Koori IV, and began to depend solely on firepower rather than tactics.<ref name="NEGAS" /> He also felt that his stronghold on Bomis Koori IV could not be conquered by less than one hundred Jedi. However, he was proven wrong when a mere two Jedi forced their way into the bulwark and deactivated the shields. Dassyne paid for his overconfidence with his life.<ref name="Oro Dassyne in the Databank" />

==Behind the scenes==
Created for ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars]]'', Oro Dassyne was voiced by [[Terrence Carson]] and credited as ''Alien General''. Most of his backstory was later given by the official ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[Databank (original)|Databank]].
