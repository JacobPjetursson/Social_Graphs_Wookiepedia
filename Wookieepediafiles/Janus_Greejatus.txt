'''Janus Greejatus''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] official who served on the [[Imperial Ruling Council|Ruling Council]] of the [[Galactic Empire]]. Prior to the [[Imperial Era|Age of the Empire]], he [[Emissary|represented]] the [[Office of the Chancellor|office]] of [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]] at the homecoming of [[Poggle the Lesser]] on the [[planet]] [[Geonosis]]. Following the end of the [[Clone Wars]] and the [[Proclamation of the New Order|birth]] of the [[New Order]], Greejatus continued to serve Palpatine, now the [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] of [[the galaxy]].

==Biography==
During the [[Clone Wars]], a pan-[[The galaxy|galactic]] civil war between the [[Galactic Republic]] and [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]], Janus Greejatus served as an [[emissary]] of [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]]. During the homecoming of [[Poggle the Lesser]], Greejatus attended the ceremony&mdash;alongside several other dignitaries, including [[Ars Dangor]], [[Sly Moore]], [[Sate Pestage]] and [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Orson Callan Krennic|Orson Krennic]]&mdash;which took place in the [[Petranaki arena]], on the [[planet]] [[Geonosis]].<ref name="Catalyst" />

Greejatus would go on to serve Palpatine as one of his closest [[Advisor|advisers]]<ref name="DB Janus" /> after the latter's [[Proclamation of the New Order|rise]] as [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] of the [[Galactic Empire]]. Approximately five [[Standard year|years]] into the [[Imperial Era|Age of the Empire]], he was serving in the ranks of the [[Imperial Ruling Council]], a governing body which consisted of the [[Emperor's adviser]]s who oversaw the [[Standard day|daily]] management of the Empire.<ref name="Trkn" />

In the years leading up to the [[Galactic Civil War]], Greejatus and his colleague, [[Sim Aloo]] were tasked with collecting [[Sith]] [[Sith artifact|artifacts]] from across [[the galaxy]] for their master. The Emperor heard rumors of an [[Enchantress' book|book]] of [[Dark side of the force|dark power]] guarded by [[Corellian hound|monsters]] in a [[forest]] on the [[planet]] [[Ushruu]] and expressed interest in having it for himself. Greejatus hired a team of [[Trandoshan]]s to retrieve the [[book]] from the Ushruu. However, the trandoshans were eaten by the [[queen snarler]], and Greejatus' plan failed.<ref name="Mighty Chewbacca">''[[The Mighty Chewbacca in the Forest of Fear!]]''</ref>

In the year [[4 ABY]], Greejatus accompanied the Emperor aboard the [[Death Star II|second Death Star]].<ref name="ROTJ" /> It was later assumed that Greejatus was aboard the Death Star when it exploded during the [[Battle of Endor]], but his ultimate fate was unknown.<ref name="DB Janus" />
