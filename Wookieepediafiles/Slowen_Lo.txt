'''Slowen Lo''' was a [[Sexes|male]] [[Abednedo (species)|Abednedo]]<ref name="Databank" /> who resided on [[Canto Bight]]. He made a fortune-selling [[wikipedia:driftwood|driftwood]] sculptures and lived on the beach in the coastal [[city]] on the [[desert]] [[planet]] [[Cantonica]].<ref name="Visual">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> In [[34 ABY]], Lo saw [[Finn]] and [[Rose Tico]] illegally land and abandon their ship on a [[Canto Bight]] beach. Annoyed, Lo told Finn and Rose they were not allowed to leave the ship there, but they ignored him and proceeded to the [[Canto Casino]]. Lo informed the [[Canto Bight Police Department]] about this and accompanied officers to the casino, where he observed Finn and Rose and confirmed their identities to the police. He was startled as the officers [[stun]]ned and arrested Finn and Rose.<ref name="Episode VIII">[[Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VIII ''The Last Jedi'']]</ref>

==Personality and traits==
A proud citizen of Canto Bight,<ref name="Databank" /> Slowen Lo took his job very seriously, something that was demonstrated as when Finn and Rose Tico refused to pay attention to him that they should not park on the beach. Not wanting them to get away with it, he chose to call the Canto Bight Police Department to have them arrested.<ref name="Episode VIII" />
