'''Kaplan''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] who served as a [[colonel]] in the [[First Order]]. In the [[Standard year|year]] [[34 ABY]], Kaplan was posted in a control room in [[Hangar Six]] on board the [[Resurgent-class Star Destroyer|''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Finalizer]]'' when it traveled to the [[planet]] [[Jakku]] in order to try and recover a portion of the [[Map to Skywalker|map]] showing the location of [[Jedi Master]] [[Luke Skywalker]].

After the [[Resistance pilot]] [[Poe Dameron]] was brought on board the ''Finalizer'' for [[Torture|questioning]], he and the defecting [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|First Order stormtrooper]] [[Finn|FN-2187]] [[Escape from the Finalizer|stole]] a [[TIE/sf space superiority fighter]] from [[Hangar]] Six in an attempt to escape. As the [[starfighter]] was still connected to its support cable, it was unable to leave the hangar after taking off, and Kaplan was alerted to the escape attempt by [[Petty officer|Petty Officer]] [[Thanisson]]. While Dameron attempted to disconnect the support cabling, FN-2187 blasted the main control room where Kaplan and Thanisson were standing, forcing the [[First Order officer|officers]] present to scramble for cover. However, the [[TIE line|TIE]] fighter sustained damage while escaping and crashed on Jakku.

==Biography==
===Mission to Jakku===
[[File:TFA FirstOrder Star Destroyer.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Kaplan was stationed on board the ''Finalizer''.]]
Kaplan was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] who served in the [[First Order military|military branch]] of the [[First Order]] during their [[Cold war|conflict]] with the [[Resistance]], an offshoot of the [[New Republic]].<ref name="Episode VII" /> In the [[Standard year|year]] [[34 ABY]],<ref name="SWGA">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates the events of [[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']], including Kaplan's appearance, to [[34 ABY]].</ref> Kaplan held the rank of [[colonel]] and was stationed on board<ref name="Episode VII" /> the [[Resurgent-class Star Destroyer|''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Finalizer]]'',<ref name="TFAVD">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> where he was posted<ref name="Episode VII" /> in the main control room for [[Hangar Six]].<ref name="TFAn">[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)|''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' novelization]]</ref>

Kaplan was on board the ''Finalizer'' when it traveled to the [[planet]] [[Jakku]] in search of the<ref name="Episode VII" /> retired [[Scout|explorer]]<ref name="TFAVD" /> [[Lor San Tekka]], who held a piece of a [[Map to Skywalker|map]] to the location of [[Jedi Master]] [[Luke Skywalker]]. After the First Order [[Attack on Tuanul|deployed]] [[First Order military|forces]] to San Tekka's home village of [[Tuanul]], the explorer was [[Death|killed]] and the [[Resistance pilot]] [[Poe Dameron]] was captured; however, the map was spirited away by Dameron's [[astromech droid]] [[BB-8]], whom the First Order failed to capture.<ref name="Episode VII" />

===An unauthorized departure from Bay Two===
[[File:Hangar Six control room.png|thumb|right|250px|The control room Kaplan was stationed in was destroyed during FN-2187 and Poe Dameron's escape attempt.]]
{{Quote|Fourteen failed. Eighteen&mdash;|A report given in Kaplan's control center shortly before its explosion|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|audio=Fourteen Failed Eighteen.ogg}}
Dameron was brought on board the ''Finalizer'' for [[Torture|interrogation]], but as the hunt for BB-8 began, the [[pilot]] was [[Escape from the Finalizer|freed]] by [[Finn|FN-2187]], a [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtrooper]] hoping to defect from the First Order. The [[trooper]] brought Dameron into Hangar Six under the pretense of escorting the [[prisoner]] and then hurriedly boarded one<ref name="Episode VII" /> of the [[TIE/sf space superiority fighter]]s<ref name="TFAVD" /> in [[Bay Two]] of the hangar. When the pair attempted to take off, they discovered the [[starfighter]]'s support cabling was still attached, preventing their escape and drawing the attention of [[Petty officer|Petty Officer]] [[Thanisson]] in the control room.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Thanisson immediately reported the unsanctioned departure to Kaplan, who ordered that the [[TIE line|TIE]] be stopped from escaping while [[General]]<ref name="Episode VII" /> [[Armitage Hux]],<ref name="A:LD">''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]''</ref> head of the First Order's military, be alerted. [[Squad]]s of stormtroopers<ref name="Episode VII" /> carrying [[F-11D blaster rifle]]s and [[FWMB-10 repeating blaster]]s<ref name="TFAVD" /> then attempted to shoot down the starfighter, but were unsuccessful as FN-2187 used the vehicle's<ref name="Episode VII" /> [[Lb-14 dual heavy laser turret]]<ref name="TFAVD" /> to blast many of them. The trooper then turned the [[turret]] on the control room, shattering the [[Viewport|windows]] in an explosion and throwing Thanisson from his seat while Kaplan and the other [[First Order officer|officers]] present tried to cower away from the blast. Once Dameron managed to disconnect the support cabling, the fighter escaped from the ''Finalizer'' and headed for Jakku, but was shot down by the [[battlecruiser]] en route and crashed on the planet's surface.<ref name="Episode VII" />
