'''Ketsu Onyo''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|female]] [[Mandalorian]] from [[Shukut]] who worked as a [[bounty hunter]] in the employ of [[Black Sun]] in the [[Standard year|years]] prior to the [[Battle of Yavin]]. She was a friend of [[Sabine Wren]] and helped the [[Imperial cadet|cadet]] escape from the [[Imperial Academy of Mandalore|Imperial Academy]] on [[Mandalore]]. The two became bounty hunting partners before she and Wren parted on bad terms, and Wren joined the [[Spectres]]. After leaving Sabine for dead, Ketsu joined Black Sun.

Ketsu later resurfaced on [[Garel]] where she accepted a job from Black Sun to steal a [[GNK-series power droid]] called [[EG-86]], who was carrying sensitive information. However, this job brought her into conflict with Wren and her rebel associates [[C1-10P|Chopper]] and [[Ezra Bridger]]. Following a struggle that ended in the space above Garel, Ketsu and Sabine reconciled and the two joined forces to escape an [[Arquitens-class command cruiser|''Arquitens''-class command cruiser]] and deliver EG-86 to the rebellion on [[Havoc Outpost]]. While Ketsu declined Wren's offer to join the rebellion, the two departed on friendly terms.

Later, Ketsu helped the [[Phoenix Cell]] to obtain [[fuel]] from [[Horizon Base]]. She later aided the Spectres by fighting off Imperial forces during an Imperial [[Attack on Phoenix Squadron (3 BBY)|attack]] on the rebel fleet. Ketsu's actions enabled the ''[[Ghost]]'' to land on the [[Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier|rebel flagship]] and deliver vital supplies to the rebels. Having refueled, the rebels were able to escape to the planet [[Atollon]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born on the [[planet]] [[Shukut]] in [[22 BBY]],<ref name="Scum and Villainy Case Files" /> Ketsu Onyo was a [[Mandalorian]] [[Soldier|warrior]] and [[artist]]<ref name="SW:TVE">''[[Star Wars: The Visual Encyclopedia]]''</ref> who lived during the [[Imperial Era|Age of the Empire]] and studied with [[Sexes|her]] friend [[Sabine Wren]] at the [[Imperial Academy of Mandalore|Imperial Academy]] on [[Mandalore]].<ref name="GalacticAtlas" /> At some point, they decided to escape the [[Imperial Academy|Academy]], Ketsu helped her friend escape from the academy and the two became [[bounty hunter]]s. However, Wren alleged that Ketsu became "greedy" and left her for [[Death|dead]] while she alone joined [[Black Sun]]. Meanwhile, Sabine survived and joined a [[Spectres|group of rebels]] that operated from the [[starship]] ''[[Ghost]]'' and was part of a larger rebellion [[Early rebellion against the Galactic Empire|against]] the [[Galactic Empire]].<ref name="Blood Sisters" />

===Repairing a Friendship===
[[File:Blood Sisters ep guide.png|thumb|left|254x254px|Ketsu Onyo's tense reunion with her former friend Sabine Wren.]]
Several [[Standard year|years]] later, Ketsu crossed paths with her former friend Sabine on the [[planet]] [[Garel]]. Onyo had been sent by Black Sun to collect the [[GNK-series power droid]] [[EG-86]], who was carrying information of vital importance to the rebellion. The [[droid]] was scheduled to arrive on a [[GX1 short hauler]] at [[Garel City]]'s [[Garel City Spaceport|spaceport]]. However, Ketsu's mission was complicated when she discovered that Sabine and two rebel associates, the [[astromech droid]] [[C1-10P]] and the human [[Jedi]] [[Padawan]] [[Ezra Bridger]], had already picked up the courier droid. Shortly after, Ketsu emerged from hiding and confronted Sabine.<ref name="Blood Sisters" />

After a tense reunion, Ketsu demanded that Sabine and her friends surrender EG-86. She also told Sabine that she would have been better off dead rather than joining the rebellion since the Empire had put a [[bounty]] on Sabine's head. Wren refused to back down and the two former friends prepared for a showdown. However, their confrontation was interrupted by the arrival of a [[stormtrooper]] patrol. When the stormtroopers demanded that they leave the [[spaceport]], Onyo opened fire on the stormtroopers with her [[blaster]]; sparking a three-way gun [[Skirmish in the Garel City Spaceport|battle]]. In the midst of the fighting, Sabine and her rebel associates managed to escape with EG-86 on a stolen [[shuttle]]. However, one of the rebels, Ezra, was separated from his comrades after falling out of the side entryway.<ref name="Blood Sisters" />

Ketsu was then surrounded by stormtrooper reinforcements who held her at gunpoint. However, she turned the tables on them and took the stormtroopers out in [[hand-to-hand combat]]. She then pursued the rebels on her personal starship ''[[Shadow Caster]]''. In [[Realspace|space]], Ketsu quickly caught up with the rebels' shuttle and managed to disable its [[hyperdrive]]. Ketsu then shot open the shuttle's side door, causing a [[hull]] breach which sucked Chopper out into the [[vacuum]] of space. Satisfied that she made her point, Onyo brought the ''Shadow Caster'' face-to-face with the rebels' shuttle and repeated her ultimatum to Sabine.<ref name="Blood Sisters" />

Unknown to Ketsu, Chopper had survived the breach and had managed to use his [[rocket booster]]s to sneak up on the ''Shadow Caster''. Having noticed that Chopper was sabotaging the ''Shadow Caster{{'s}}'' main [[turbolaser]] [[turret]], Sabine deliberately prolonged their conversation to give Chopper enough [[time]] to complete his work. When Onyo expressed pride at working for Black Sun, Sabine derided the crime syndicate as a bunch of [[slaver]]s and [[assassin]]s. After Sabine rejected her ultimatum again, Onyo reluctantly opened fire on Wren's shuttle only to discover that her turret had been sabotaged. This gave enough time for Sabine to escape in her shuttle.<ref name="Blood Sisters" />

[[File:Hera talks to Ketsu and Sabine.jpeg|thumb|right|268x268px|Onyo is offered to join the rebellion by the rebels.]]
However, Onyo managed to trap Chopper with the ''Shadow Caster{{'s}}'' [[tractor beam]]s and took him [[prisoner]]. Communicating with Sabine over the intercom, Sabine offered to trade Chopper for EG-86. Unwilling to abandon her rebel comrade to Ketsu, Sabine reluctantly returned and docked her shuttle with the ''Shadow Caster''. Meeting face to face, Ketsu discovered that Sabine was determined not to give up the courier droid. She offered to split the bounty but Wren was not interested in profits and reiterated her devotion to the Rebel cause. Onyo was skeptical that the rebellion would succeed and responded that she was solely concerned with her own survival. After a tense discussion, the two former friends reconciled and Sabine forgave Ketsu for abandoning her.<ref name="Blood Sisters" />

Their reunion was however interrupted by the arrival of an Imperial [[Arquitens-class command cruiser|''Arquitens''-class command cruiser]], which had responded to the theft of the shuttle. Sabine quickly improvised an escape plan which involved exploding the shuttle to create a distraction that would allow the rebels, Ketsu, and EG-86 to escape on the ''Shadow Caster''. Ketsu cooperated with Sabine's plan and personally evacuated her old friend after Sabine was knocked out by an Imperial [[laser]] blast. Sabine's plan succeeded and they managed to escape in Ketsu's starship.<ref name="Blood Sisters" />

Following their escape, Ketsu and the rebels traveled to [[Havoc Outpost]] where they delivered EG-86 to a group of [[Alderaanian]] rebels that included the astromech droid [[R2-D2]]. Ketsu then brought her rebel allies back to Garel. Due to her efforts in helping the rebels to deliver EG-86, Ketsu was thanked by [[Phoenix Leader]] [[Hera Syndulla]], the leader of Sabine's rebel cell. Before departing, Sabine told Onyo that she would always be welcome in the rebellion. Ketsu then departed on the ''Shadow Caster''.<ref name="Blood Sisters" />

===Hunting the Black Nail===
[[File:Ketsu on Ammon IV.JPG|thumb|left|220x220px|Ketsu on Ammon IV.]]
Shortly thereafter, Onyo was hired to capture [[Jarret]], a human male who had once worked as an enforcer for the Black Sun under the alias of "the Black Nail." After tracking him to the [[desert]] planet [[Ammon IV]], she travelled there with a box full of Imperial blasters rigged to explode on request. When she arrived at Jarret's [[Jarret's farm|homestead]], however, she found that the man and his family were already in a showdown with a [[Kruno]]'s [[Kruno's gang|band]] of thugs. Faking exhaustion, Onyo allowed the thugs to seize the blasters and remotely activated the blasters, removing the gang from the face of Ammon IV. At first, Jarret moved to thank his savior, but the bounty hunter threw him a hard punch in the face, revealing that she had come to collect the bounty on his head. When Jarret's wife Loris started to plead for her husband's life, Onyo recounted how the Black Nail had been a sadistic killer. As it turned out, Loris knew all about her husband's dark past, but was conviced he had truly changed. When their son Bron tried to intervene, pointing a skinny blaster rifle at Onyo, Jarret finally decided to surrender. Onyo found herself unexpectedly moved by Jarret's acceptance of his fate, as well as his desire to keep his son out of the cycle of violence. Realizing that Sabine Wren had recently given her a second chance in life, the bounty hunter decided to give Jarret the benefit of the doubt. Instead of killing him, she left with his ripped and bloodied shirt, so her clients would believe he was dead.<ref name="TLTC">{{SWRMCite||Too Late to Change}}</ref>

===Assisting the rebellion===
[[File:Yost system hologram.jpg|thumb|right|248x248px|Onyo points out the location of the Yost system on the map.]]
Ketsu attended a briefing on the [[Mission to Ryloth (Phoenix Squadron)|captured]] [[Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier|Imperial light carrier]] that had become the [[Phoenix Cell]]'s [[Phoenix Nest|headquarters]]. By cross-referencing several [[Galactic Republic]] and [[Lasat]] maps, the rebels found that the planet [[Berzite]]'s [[Berzite's moon|moon]] in the [[Yost system]] was a prospective candidate for a rebel base. Ketsu advocated setting up a base on Berzite's [[moon]] on the grounds that the Empire did not have a presence there. However, the rebels were unable to make the trip since the Yost system was a few [[parsec]]s away and their [[cruiser]]-[[carrier]] was running low on [[fuel]].<ref name="The Forgotten Droid">{{Rebels|The Forgotten Droid}}</ref>

Sabine, who had been studying [[Imperial Navy|Imperial fleet]] movements, mentioned that an Imperial fuel shipment was arriving at [[Horizon Base]]. [[Commander]] [[Jun Sato]] approved of the plan and sent the Spectres to steal the fuel. When the Phoenix fleet came under [[Attack on Phoenix Squadron (3 BBY)|attack]] from [[Imperial Military|Imperial forces]] under [[Admiral]] [[Kassius Konstantine]], Onyo used the ''Shadow Caster'' to clear a path for the rebel starship, the ''Ghost'', to land safely in one of the carrier's [[hangar]] bays.<ref name="The Forgotten Droid" />

[[File:Onyo & Chadra-fan.jpg|thumb|left|235x235px|Ketsu saving the young Chadra-Fan boy.]]
After officially leaving Black Sun, Ketsu went with Sabine to Garel City. There, they planned to steal several food containers and supplies for the Rebellion. Ketsu and Sabine were then able to knockout several storm troopers with their helmets. They were then confronted by several blaster wielding storm troopers. Ketsu then rescued a young [[Chadra-Fan]] [[Unidentified Chadra-Fan boy|boy]] from a falling food container. She and Sabine then met with the Hera and the ''Ghost''. After dropping off the boy, Ketsu then decided to join the Rebellion.<ref name="Newest Recruit" />

Ketsu then rendezvous with Sabine and Hera at Garel City on their bikes. Ketsu's bike exploded, but she survived it.<ref name="Crash Course">{{FOD|Crash Course}}</ref>

===Helping Ezra===
[[File:Hera mustering allies.jpeg|thumb|right|246x246px|Ketsu with other Rebels at Joopa Base.]]
In [[1 BBY]], the Spectres recruited Ketsu Onyo to locate the [[Weequay]] [[pirate]] and [[smuggler]] [[Hondo Ohnaka]], an ally of Ezra. Ketsu managed to locate Hondo and his [[Ugnaught]] companion [[Melch]] at [[Joopa Base]], a modified [[All Terrain Armored Transport (early rebellion against the Empire)|AT-AT walker]] that served as the home of the former [[Clone commando]]s [[CC-5576-39|Gregor]] and [[CC-3636|Wolffe]]. Ketsu and the others agreed to help Ezra [[Liberation of Lothal|liberate]] his homeworld of [[Lothal]] from Imperial rule.<ref name="A Fool's Hope">{{Rebels|A Fool's Hope}}</ref>

Ketsu served as Hera's co-pilot aboard the ''Ghost'' during a battle with [[Governor]] [[Arihnda Pryce]]s' forces at the [[Lothal resistance]]'s [[Lothal cliff dwelling|mountainside base]]. Following the battle, she along with Hera, Rex, Hondo, and Melch met up with Ezra, who thanked them for their help. Having captured Governor Pryce, the rebels then proceeded with their plan to drive the Empire from Lothal.<ref name="A Fool's Hope" />

===Liberation of Lothal===
[[File:Lothal rebels and Spectres inside the Dome.jpeg|thumb|left|234x234px|Ketsu with other rebels at Lothal's Imperial Complex.]]
With the help of an unwilling Pryce, Ketsu along with the rest of the Lothal rebels infiltrated the [[Imperial Complex (Lothal)|Imperial Complex]], a mobile [[Imperial Planetary Occupation Facility]] that served as the Imperial headquarters on Lothal. After landing, she, Sabine, and Zeb then worked together together to unlock the doors to the complex. Ketsu also jammed the Imperials' transmissions, allowing the rebels to capture the command center. The rebels then initiated a faux [[Protocol 13]] to evacuate all Imperial forces on Lothal aboard the Dome.<ref name="Family Reunion – & Farewell">{{Rebels|Family Reunion – and Farewell}}</ref>

Before the rebels could launch the Dome into the sky, [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]] returned aboard his Star Destroyer ''[[Chimaera]]''. Since the ''Chimaera'' was blocking their path, Hera ordered Ketsu to abort the launch sequence due to the chance of crashing into the Star Destroyer and destroying [[Capital City]] below. Since the [[Noghri]] assassin [[Rukh]] and the Imperial forces had disabled the Dome's [[deflector shield generator]], Thrawn was able to bombard Capital City and force Ezra to meet him aboard the ''Chimaera'' to discuss his unconditional surrender.<ref name="Family Reunion – & Farewell" />

In Ezra's absence, the rebels adopted Sabine's plan to recapture the north and south power terminals in order to restart the Dome's deflector shield. As part of Team A, Ketsu went with the former [[Clone Captain]] [[Rex]] and the Weequay Hondo Ohnaka to secure the north tower's power terminal. Despite fierce opposition from Imperial forces, the rebels managed to reach the northern power terminal. Though Ketsu had no idea of how to find the over-ride panels to activate several bridges, she managed to find the manual override hatch and extended the bridges. This enabled the rebels to secure both power terminals and restart the Dome's shield generator, protecting Capital City from a second bombardment wave.<ref name="Family Reunion – & Farewell" />

After a pod of purrgil under Ezra's command carried Ezra, Thrawn, and the ''Chimaera'' into uncharted space, Ketsu and the rebels launched the Dome into Lothal's upper atmosphere. As Imperial forces stormed the command center a second time, the rebels evacuated aboard the ''Ghost''. Once safely airborne, the rebels detonated the Dome, wiping out the Imperial garrison on Lothal. This ended Imperial rule on Lothal.<ref name="Family Reunion – & Farewell" />

==Personality and traits==
[[File:Ketsu Onyo XW.png|thumb|right|244x244px|Onyo in a [[cantina]].]]
Ketsu Onyo was a close friend of Sabine Wren, when they both escaped from the Imperial Academy, Ketsu helped her friend. After helping Wren escape, the two became bounty hunters and hoped to work for the Black Sun crime syndicate. According to Sabine, Ketsu then got "greedy", left her for dead, and went to join the Black Sun by herself. As a bounty hunter in the service of Black Sun, Ketsu was ruthless, self-centered, and goal-oriented.<ref name="Blood Sisters" />

Despite her [[mercenary]] streak, Ketsu still could not bring herself to kill her former friend Sabine during a mission to obtain the GNK-series [[power droid]] EG-86. When Sabine chose to forgive her, Ketsu responded well to her friend's grace and admired Sabine's team spirit and devotion to the rebellion. She helped her formerly estranged friend to escape the Empire and deliver EG-86 to the rebellion.<ref name="Blood Sisters" />

Later, Ketsu decided to assist the rebels and recommended the Yost system as a prospective location for establishing a rebel base. When the rebels came under attack from Imperial forces, Ketsu sprung to the aid of her rebel friends.<ref name="The Forgotten Droid" /> Ketsu later helped the Spectres liberate Lothal from Imperial rule.<ref name="A Fool's Hope" />

==Skills and abilities==
[[File:Ketsu-Onyo-staff-SWCT.png|left|thumb|201x201px|Onyo was highly skilled with her staff]]
Ketsu Onyo was a formidable fighter who was adept at handling both blasters and close quarters combat. She wielded a [[Ketsu's staff|staff]] that was both a melee weapon and blaster in one. On one occasion, she was able to take on several armed stormtroopers. In addition, Ketsu was a skilled [[pilot]] who owned an armed starship called the ''Shadow Caster'' that was capable on taking on other similar-sized ships.<ref name="Blood Sisters" /> She also used the ''Shadow Caster'' to engage in [[starfighter]] combat.<ref name="The Forgotten Droid" />

As a bounty hunter, Ketsu was skilled enough to track down a smuggler like Hondo, whom she regarded as talkative.<ref name="A Fool's Hope" /> Ketsu used her technical skills to help Sabine open the Dome's blast doors during the Liberation of Lothal and later to extend bridges during an operation to restart the north and south power terminals of the Dome's deflector shield.<ref name="Family Reunion – & Farewell" />

==Behind the scenes==
Ketsu Onyo was created for the [[Star Wars Rebels Season Two|second season]] of the animated television series ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''. She is voiced by actor [[Gina Torres]].
