{{Quote|L'ulo L'ampar, a skilled, fierce warrior who spent his life fighting on the side of all that is good and right in the galaxy.|General Leia Organa|Poe Dameron 14: Legend Lost, Part I}}
'''L'ulo L'ampar''' was a [[Sexes|male]] [[Duros]] who served as a [[commander]] in the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] and as a [[pilot]] in the [[Resistance]]. In the [[Standard year|year]] [[4 ABY]], [[Lieutenant]] L'ampar participated in the [[Battle of Endor]], flying [[L'ulo L'ampar's A-wing|an]] [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor|A-wing]] in [[Green Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Green Squadron]]. As the [[Galactic Civil War]] raged on after the Rebel victory at [[Endor]], L'ampar was promoted to [[captain]] and led [[Color|Green]] [[Squadron]] through campaigns such as the [[Battle of Cawa City|liberation]] of [[Cawa City]]. During this [[time]], L'ampar formed a close friendship with [[Shara Bey]], a fellow Green Squadron [[Rebel pilot|pilot]]. Three [[Standard month|months]] after the Battle of Endor, Bey mustered out of service, and L'ampar maintained a close relationship with her, acting as an uncle figure to her son, [[Poe Dameron]].

Over the next two [[Standard decade|decades]], [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] sympathizers organized into the [[First Order]]. Viewing it as a threat to the [[New Republic]], former Rebellion leader [[Leia Organa]] created the Resistance to [[Cold war|oppose]] the First Order and protect the Republic. L'ampar joined the [[Resistance Starfighter Corps]] and was personally selected by Dameron to join [[Black Squadron (Resistance)|Black Squadron]]. The squadron was tasked with [[Hunt for Lor San Tekka|finding]] [[Lor San Tekka]], an [[Scout|explorer]] who was believed to know the location of [[Luke Skywalker]], Organa's brother and the last [[Jedi]].

During their search, L'ampar and Black Squadron visited the [[planet]]s [[Ovanis]] and [[Megalox Beta]], facing off against [[Terex]], an [[agent]] of the [[First Order Security Bureau]]. In Black Squadron's [[Battle over a desert planet|third encounter]] with Terex, L'ampar [[Death|sacrificed]] himself to protect innocent lives. A [[Funeral of L'ulo L'ampar|funeral]] was held for L'ampar at the [[Resistance base]], where Organa and Dameron spoke highly of the Duros veteran. Later, Black Squadron's mission was completed when the pilots [[Rescue of Lor San Tekka|located]] Tekka in the [[Great Forveen Nebula]].

L'ulo L'ampar<ref name="PD14">''[[Poe Dameron 14: Legend Lost, Part I]]''</ref> was a [[Sexes|male]] [[Duros]] who served the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] during the [[Galactic Civil War]], a [[The galaxy|galaxy]]-wide conflict between the Alliance and the [[Galactic Empire]].

The [[Alliance Fleet]],<ref name="VI" /> with L'ampar in [[L'ulo L'ampar's A-wing|his A-wing]] and using the [[callsign]] of [[Green Two]],<ref name="SE1" /> exited [[hyperspace]] above the [[Endor|forest moon]] of [[Endor (planet)|Endor]], approaching the [[superweapon]].<ref name="VI" /> On the [[moon]]'s surface the [[Pathfinders]], an [[Alliance Special Forces]] unit,<ref name="SE1" /> were attempting to disable the Death Star's [[Deflector shield|shield]] by destroying its [[Death Star's shield generator|shield generator]], but when the Alliance [[Fleet]] arrived, the shield was still up and&mdash;previously unknown to the Rebellion&mdash;the superweapon was fully operational.<ref name="VI" />

[[File:Green-Squadron-attack-run.png|thumb|left|300px|L'ulo L'ampar and the pilots of Green Squadron attack the ''Executor'' during the Battle of Endor.]]
Realizing that the battle was a trap set by the Empire but unable to escape, the [[Rebel Alliance Starfighter Corps|Rebel starfighters]] engaged the Imperial forces, trying to buy more [[time]]<ref name="VI" /> for the Pathfinders. Along with [[Commander]] Crynyd and a portion of [[Color|Green]] [[Squadron]], L'ampar attacked<ref name="SE1" /> the ''[[Executor]]'', an [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought|''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought]]<ref name="USW" /> serving as [[command ship]] in the [[Imperial Navy]].<ref name="Executor">{{SWE|technology|superstardestroyer|Super Star Destroyer}}</ref> The attack brought down the ''Executor''{{'}}s shields, and Crynyd, seeing a chance to even the odds, sacrificed himself in a [[suicide]] run to destroy the [[capital ship]]'s [[Bridge (starship)|bridge]].<ref name="Databank A-wing Fighter" />

In light of Crynyd's [[death]], L'ampar assumed command of Green Squadron. Soon after, the Pathfinders succeeded in lowering the Death Star's shield, giving [[Gold Leader]] [[Lando Calrissian]]<ref name="SE1" /> and [[Red Leader]]<ref name="VI" /> [[Wedge Antilles]]<ref name="Death Star II" /> an opportunity to destroy the station. With the superweapon gone and Emperor Palpatine dead,<ref name="VI" /> the Alliance Fleet regrouped and began [[Shuttle|shuttling]] [[pilot]]s to the [[forest]] moon to celebrate with the Pathfinders and local [[Ewok]] population.<ref name="SE1" />

[[File:Lulo-and-Shara.png|thumb|right|300px|L'ampar allows Shara Bey to leave for Endor.]]
Despite their victory, [[General]] [[Crix Madine]] was wary of an Imperial counter-attack, causing some pilots to remain with their [[starfighter]]s on standby. In an [[hangar]] aboard an Alliance Fleet [[starship]], L'ampar was approached by [[Green Four]] [[Shara Bey]], who inquired if she could join the festivities on Endor's moon. L'ampar, knowing she was concerned about her Pathfinder [[Marriage|husband]], [[Kes Dameron]], granted her permission to join the celebration. The following morning, Rebel [[Signal Intelligence (Rebel Alliance)|Signal Intelligence]] discovered transmissions from an Imperial [[Imperial outpost (Endor)|holdout]] on the far side of the moon. L'ampar arrived in the Ewok [[Bright Tree Village]] and attended a briefing by General [[Han Solo]], who discussed plans to remove the Imperial presence. The Rebels launched an [[Assault on an Imperial outpost|assault on the outpost]] and discovered new Imperial communications, confirming that the war was not yet over.<ref name="SE1" />

====Continued war====
{{Quote|You ever think that this is ''never'' going to ''end''?''"<br />"''Ah, Shara, you ''can't'' think that way. Otherwise we're just ''fighting'' for the sake of the fight, right?|Shara Bey and L'ulo L'ampar|Shattered Empire, Part IV}}
[[File:Feral-Group-and-Green-Squadron.png|thumb|left|300px|Weeks after the Battle of Endor, L'ampar leads Green Squadron in the battle of Cawa City.]]
Seventeen [[Standard day|days]] after the Battle of Endor, L'ampar commanded Green Squadron to [[Battle of Cawa City|liberate]] [[Cawa City]]&mdash;the Imperial-held [[capital]] of [[Sterdic IV]]&mdash;alongside [[Feral Group]]. During the battle, Bey, flying as Green Two, assisted L'ampar by destroying a [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighter]] pursuing him. Shortly after, when [[Shara Bey's A-wing|Bey's A-wing]] became damaged and started leaking [[coolant]], the Duros returned the favor and downed her attacker. Once Bey was safe, L'ampar ordered [[Feral Leader]] to issue an attack run on an<ref name="SE2" /> [[All Terrain Armored Transport]].<ref name="AT-AT">{{Databank|at-at-walker|AT-AT Walker (All Terrain Armored Transport)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203025720/http://www.starwars.com/databank/at-at-walker}}</ref> [[BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber|Y-wing bomber]] pilots [[Feral Two]] and [[Feral Three]] then dropped clusters of explosives, which became [[magnet]]ically attached to the [[walker]] and destroyed it, successfully ending the conflict. After the battle, L'ampar spoke with Bey about how hard she had been working, encouraging her to spend time with her husband and her son, [[Poe Dameron|Poe]].<ref name="SE2" />

During the next two [[Standard month|months]], L'ampar continued to serve the Alliance Fleet and received a promotion to [[captain]].<ref name="SE4">''[[Shattered Empire, Part IV]]''</ref> In [[5 ABY]],<ref name="Galactic Atlas" /> three months after the Battle of Endor, [[Admiral]] [[Gial Ackbar]] and General Madine informed the fleet that the war did not have a foreseeable end, so L'ampar submitted resignation [[paper]]work for Bey, telling her that she had done more than expected and that she had a family to look after. Bey heeded L'ampar's advice and settled into a [[Yavin 4 colony]] with her husband.<ref name="SE4" /> Soon after, the Rebellion formally [[Declaration of a New Republic|became]] the [[New Republic]], and mere days after the Battle of Endor's one [[Standard year|year]] anniversary, the [[Galaxy|Galactic]] Civil War ended with the Empire's defeat at the [[Battle of Jakku]] and the signing of the [[Galactic Concordance]].<ref name="Lost Stars">''[[Lost Stars]]''</ref>

In the following years, L'ampar maintained his friendship with Bey and Dameron, and he acted as an uncle figure for their son.<ref name="PD3">''[[Poe Dameron 3: Black Squadron, Part III]]''</ref> Prior to Bey's death in [[10 ABY]],<ref name="Chronology Note">''[[Before the Awakening]]'' establishes that [[Shara Bey]] [[Death|died]] when her son, [[Poe Dameron]], was eight [[Standard year|years]] old.

===Black Squadron===
====Mission to Ovanis====
=====First contact=====
{{Dialogue|L'ampar|I was about a second away from flying down into that cavern and looking for you, son.|Poe Dameron|I'm fine, L'ulo. Listen, all of you. We've been made.

They're ''already here''.|attr=L'ampar, Poe Dameron, and Karé Kun, during the mission to Ovanis|src=Poe Dameron 1: Black Squadron, Part I}}
Over the next two [[Standard decade|decades]], Imperial sympathizers created the [[First Order]], a successor state of the Empire. Believing the First Order to be a threat to the Republic, [[Leia Organa]], a war hero and leader of the Rebellion, organized the [[Resistance]] to [[Cold war|oppose]] the First Order and protect the Republic.<ref name="Bloodline">''[[Bloodline (novel)|Bloodline]]''</ref> L'ampar joined General Organa's Resistance, offering his piloting skills to its [[Resistance Starfighter Corps|Starfighter Corps]].<ref name="PD1" /> By [[34 ABY]],<ref name="34 ABY note">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' establishes that the [[Battle of Endor]] took place in [[4 ABY]]. Since ''[[Poe Dameron 1: Black Squadron, Part I]]'' is set "thirty [[Standard year|years]]" after the Battle of [[Endor]], it can be deduced that [[Poe Dameron]] joined the [[Resistance]] by [[34 ABY]].</ref> Bey's son Dameron also joined, becoming recognized as the Resistance's best,<ref name="PD1" /> most daring [[Resistance pilot|pilot]].<ref name="VII">[[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']]</ref>

[[File:Black_Squadron_assembled.png|thumb|right|300px|L'ampar is personally selected by Poe Dameron to join Black Squadron.]]
Soon after Dameron joined, Organa tasked him with [[Hunt for Lor San Tekka|locating]] [[Lor San Tekka]], an [[Scout|explorer]] who knew the whereabouts of [[Luke Skywalker]]&mdash;Organa's brother and the last [[Jedi]] in the galaxy. The First Order was also searching for Skywalker, and although trouble was unlikely, Organa authorized Dameron to select a squadron of four pilots and a [[technician]]. Choosing friends whom he could trust, Dameron recruited L'ampar, along with technician [[Oddy Muva]] and [[T-70 X-wing starfighter|T-70 X-wing]] pilots [[Temmin Wexley]], [[Karé Kun]], and [[Jessika Pava]], to form [[Black Squadron (Resistance)|Black Squadron]]. Dameron informed the group that they would be departing on a [[Mission to Ovanis|mission]], but, to L'ampar's disapproval, the purpose of their mission remained classified.<ref name="PD1" />

Black Squadron departed from the secret [[Resistance base]] on [[D'Qar]], traveling to [[Ovanis]], an uneven, [[mountain]]ous [[Planet|world]] where Tekka was last seen. While Dameron scouted an [[Cave of the Crèche|artificial cavern]] with [[Black One|his X-wing]], L'ampar and the other three pilots remained flying above the surface. Dameron reported his findings to Wexley, explaining that he had found a settlement and a [[Crèche egg|large egg]]. Black Squadron then lost contact with Dameron, but just as L'ampar readied himself to enter the [[cave]]rn, the transmission was restored. Dameron reported that he was fine, but that he had found a [[Homing beacon|tracker]] on his ship and that the First Order was likely to arrive soon. Dameron's fears were already fulfilled, however, as Kun spotted a First Order [[First Order platform|platform]], loaded with two<ref name="PD1" /> [[AAL-1971/9.1 Troop Transport|Atmospheric Assault Landers]],<ref name="TFA Cross-Sections">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: Incredible Cross-Sections]]''</ref> eight<ref name="PD1" /> [[TIE/fo space superiority fighter]]s,<ref name="TFA Cross-Sections" /> and numerous [[rocket trooper]]s, above the cavern's entrance.<ref name="PD1" />

[[File:Lulo-opens-fire.png|thumb|left|300px|L'ampar's "finger slips," provoking the First Order forces on Ovanis.]]
As the First Order [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtroopers]] entered the cave, Dameron contacted the squadron again, requesting aid. Since Black Squadron was not authorized to initiate a fight with the First Order, Pava suggested prompting the enemy pilots to shoot first. Aware that the First Order [[TIE line|TIE]] fighters were more maneuverable than the [[X-wing starfighter|X-wings]], L'ampar volunteered to aggravate the enemy pilots with his [[A-wing starfighter|A-wing]]. Flying low and cheering, the Duros flew past the enemy platform; however, the [[First Order TIE Fighter Pilot|TIE pilots]] were unresponsive. L'ampar concluded that they, too, were under orders not to engage, so the Duros attempted another pass, although this time he strafed the [[Transport|platform]] with [[laser]] [[fire]], casually claiming that his "[[Limb|finger]] slipped" on the trigger.<ref name="PD2">''[[Poe Dameron 2: Black Squadron, Part II]]''</ref>

The TIE pilots quickly responded to the attack, allowing Black Squadron to engage. The TIE fighters were swiftly eliminated, but before L'ampar could land on the platform to [[Fuel|refuel]], it exploded, leading L'ampar to believe his volley had been too intense. The burning transport crashed over the cavern's entrance and sealed Dameron inside with the First Order [[troop]]s, but Wexley was confident that Dameron would be fine. However, despite Black Squadron seemingly having the upper hand, dozens of TIE fighters arrived from [[orbit]], continuing the fight.<ref name="PD2" />

=====Encountering the Crèche=====
{{Quote|I reviewed the after-action reports&mdash;you escalated the situation. You completely blew off the rules of engagement. You fired first. You gave the First Order an excuse to attack us.''"<br />"''Absolutely. And I'd do it again. We both know that's where things are headed. Every TIE fighter we destroy now is one less that can attack us when things really get hot. We have to fight them every chance we get!|Poe Dameron and L'ulo L'ampar|Poe Dameron 4: Lockdown, Part I}}
Pava noted that Black Squadron was outnumbered five to one, and she suggested that they remove themselves from the fight. L'ampar agreed, also adding that Dameron might be able to assist if given more time. Black Squadron then split up, flying into the canyons and engaging the TIE fighters. However, when Pava's fighter received damage, the squadron regrouped in the open air. As the starfighters of Black Squadron began running dangerously low on fuel, Dameron contacted them again, warning them that something was heading their way. As Dameron spoke, two gigantic, [[Unidentified Crèche creature|winged entities]]&mdash;[[Reproduction|born]] from the [[egg]] Dameron had discovered&mdash;broke through the ground, locked in a fight. As the [[Species|creatures]] fought, Wexley commanded Black Squadron to enter the newly formed hole and land at the outpost inside.<ref name="PD3" />

[[File:Black-Squadron-and-Creche.png|thumb|right|300px|Black Squadron and the Crèche elder discuss Agent Terex's fate.]]
Grounded inside the cavern and reunited with Dameron, the members of Black Squadron and the [[Crèche (culture)|Crèche]]&mdash;the cavern's religious residents&mdash;rounded up the First Order troops and their leader, [[Agent]] [[Terex]] of the [[First Order Security Bureau]]. The agent remarked that taking him [[prisoner]] would provide the First Order justification to attack the New Republic, so Dameron consulted with L'ampar, Wexley, and the Crèche's [[Unidentified Crèche elder|religious elder]] on what to do. L'ampar suggested refueling, destroying Terex's [[Maxima-A class heavy cruiser|cruiser]], and leaving him with the Crèche, although Dameron turned down the idea, saying the First Order would send reinforcements to search for Terex. Stumped, Wexley scoffed that they should let the agent go, but the Crèche elder agreed, saying Terex could no longer hurt them, to which Dameron concurred. Once refueled and in the planet's orbit, Dameron told his team that the Crèche provided him with a lead on Tekka's whereabouts: [[Megalox|prison]].<ref name="PD3" />

L'ampar and the rest of Black Squadron returned to the Resistance base on D'Qar, where they drank and celebrated their victory. The Duros enjoyed his drink, telling Dameron how much he had needed it and that fighting off the First Order was a proper cause for celebration. Dameron, who had reviewed the [[after-action report]]s and learned of L'ampar escalating the fight, told the Duros that he had broken the rules of engagement and gave the First Order a reason to attack. However, L'ampar held to his actions, telling Dameron that war was inevitable and that every fighter they destroyed was one less that would attack them when the fight truly began. Dameron argued L'ampar's statement, saying that while Black Squadron was stronger than enemy forces, the Resistance was not, and giving the First Order justification for an attack would set the Resistance against one-to-one-thousand odds. Dameron added that L'ampar was right&mdash;war was inevitable&mdash;but they were not yet ready, and they had to gather the needed resources before time ran out.<ref name="PD4">''[[Poe Dameron 4: Lockdown, Part I]]''</ref>

====Visiting Grakkus====
=====Arrival on Megalox Beta=====
{{Quote|Turns out our man Lor went to see someone named Grakkus the Hutt. He's a ''collector''&mdash;very into all sorts of Force-related things. Jedi stuff. Or he ''was'', anyway. He's been in prison since the days of the Empire. A really ''nasty'' prison&hellip;for really ''nasty'' people.|Poe Dameron, informing Black Squadron of their new destination|Poe Dameron 4: Lockdown, Part I}}
As the festivities settled, Black Squadron was addressed by Dameron, who told them of their next [[Mission to Megalox Beta|mission]]: visit a [[prison]] on [[Megalox Beta]] to speak with the [[Hutt]] [[Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi|Grakkus]]. A prisoner on Megalox Beta, Grakkus [[Collector|collected]] relics relating to [[the Force]], and he was the individual whom Tekka had visited after staying with the Crèche. L'ampar and Black Squadron embarked on their trip and contacted [[Luta]], the prison's [[warden]], making arrangements to see the Hutt. Once in orbit around Megalox Beta, the squadron landed on a [[Megalox space station|space station]] and met with Luta. The warden explained that the station projected a protective field upon a portion of Megalox Beta's surface, shielding the prison from the planet's heavy [[Gravity|gravitational]] pull.<ref name="PD4" />

[[File:Black-Squadron-fights-prisoners.png|thumb|left|300px|Trapped in Megalox prison, Black Squadron fights off the rioting prisoners.]]
L'ampar and the rest of Black Squadron boarded a [[Unidentified transport (Megalox)|transport]] to the surface, escorted by prison guards who would take them to the [[Fortress of Grakkus the Hutt|fortress]] of Grakkus. However, unknown to L'ampar and his comrades, Agent Terex of the First Order had previously arrived and bribed the guards to lock the Resistance pilots inside. In the prison, L'ampar and his fellow pilots were approached by a mob of prisoners, but before a fight could start, Pava activated canisters of gas. The Black Squadron pilots donned [[breath mask]]s, using their [[blaster]]s and more gas canisters to fend off the prisoners. L'ampar and his teammates ran toward Grakkus' home, and as they neared the [[fortress]]' outer wall, the prisoners gave up the attack and gathered outside of the building's perimeter. The Resistance pilots entered the walled courtyard, where they were surrounded by the [[Grakks]], a group of [[Cybernetics|cybernetically]]-enhanced Hutts who served Grakkus. The Grakks grabbed L'ampar and the other pilots while Grakkus escorted Dameron inside the fortress.<ref name="PD4" />

After an extended wait under the Grakks' supervision, L'ampar and Black Squadron noticed the fortress doors opening and, to their surprise, Agent Terex stepped out. Terex exited the courtyard and walked through the criminal mob, which parted for him. Soon after, Dameron also exited the building to reunite with the squadron. L'ampar asked Dameron what the First Order was doing on Megalox Beta, and Dameron revealed that they too had come searching for Tekka. He further explained that Grakkus knew where Tekka was, and the Hutt would only give the information to whoever could break him out of prison first.<ref name="PD5">''[[Poe Dameron 5: Lockdown, Part II]]''</ref>

=====Operation Upside=====
{{Quote|Well, that worked.''"<br />"''Told you, L'ulo. Go get us some guns.|L'ulo L'ampar and Poe Dameron, after deactivating the gravity field|Poe Dameron 6: Lockdown, Part III}}
Dameron contacted his [[astromech droid]], [[BB-8]], and told the [[droid]] to begin "Operation Upside," a plan which involved the four astromech droids of Black Squadron&mdash;BB-8, [[R2-HA]], [[O-R10N]], and [[R4 (Black Squadron)|R4]]&mdash;altering the controls aboard the Megalox [[Realspace|space]] station and helping the Resistance members free Grakkus. However, [[Standard hour|hours]] passed without hearing from the droids, and the crowd of prisoners outside Grakkus' walls began to break into the fortress' courtyard. L'ampar and the rest of Black Squadron were quickly outnumbered, so Dameron told his squadron to retreat into Grakkus' fortress and wait out the attack. As Dameron spoke, he and L'ampar saw that Grakkus had already retreated there, closing the large, guarded doors behind him, trapping the pilots outside and forcing them to fight.<ref name="PD5" />

Fending off the attackers, L'ampar and the other pilots retreated to the front steps of Grakkus' fortress. Yelling through the doors, L'ampar called Grakkus a "[[Slug (creature)|slug]]" and demanded to be let inside, but Grakkus declined. As the prisoners overwhelmed the Resistance fighters, Dameron received a message from BB-8, informing him that Operation Upside was ready for execution. Upon Dameron's word, L'ampar and the others activated [[gravity belt]]s, and the droids overrode the space station's controls, disabling the gravity shield. The [[belt]]s kept Black Squadron from being crushed by the planet's full gravity, while the mob of prisoners, the Grakks, and Terex were all pinned to the ground. The success surprised L'ampar, and Dameron told the Duros to find guns.<ref name="PD6">''[[Poe Dameron 6: Lockdown, Part III]]''</ref>

[[File:Black_Squadron_vs_Carrion_Spike.png|thumb|right|300px|L'ampar and Black Squadron battle Terex's flagship, the ''Carrion Spike''.]]
Fully armed with L'ampar's collected weapons, Black Squadron destroyed the door to Grakkus' fortress. Inside, Dameron approached the Hutt and gave him a gravity belt. Accompanied by Grakkus, Black Squadron returned to the orbiting station, finding a shuttle for the Hutt there. Back in their starships, L'ampar and Black Squadron began escorting Grakkus' shuttle, but before they could enter hyperspace, the Megalox station was destroyed by Terex's ship, the ''[[Carrion Spike]]''. The space station launched evacuation shuttles, and as the ''Carrion Spike'' began firing upon them, Black Squadron engaged the ship. L'ampar and the other Resistance pilots quickly overpowered Terex's ship, and it jumped to [[lightspeed]]. With Terex gone and the shuttles safe, Black Squadron departed the [[Megalox system]]. Freed from the prison, Grakkus kept his deal, giving the data about Tekka to Dameron.<ref name="PD6" />

====Sacrifice====
{{Quote|Shooting unarmed escape pods? I'm sending these monsters straight to ''hell!'' [&hellip;] ''Ha! That's'' how a Rebel pilot does it, you low-down, dirty&mdash;|L'ulo L'ampar's final words|Poe Dameron 13: The Gathering Storm, Part VI}}
Back on D'Qar, Black Squadron's mission was paused while Organa reviewed the data. During this time, Dameron was assigned to a secret [[Mission to Kaddak|mission]] with the [[protocol droid]] [[C-3PO]] and the [[Resistance spy droid network]], and Dameron selected Muva to join him.<ref name="PD8">''[[Poe Dameron 8: The Gathering Storm, Part I]]''</ref> However, Agent Terex and the [[Ranc gang]]&mdash;Terex's old criminal allies&mdash;set a trap for Dameron, and a [[Battle over a desert planet|battle]] began over a [[Unidentified desert planet (Cold war)|desert planet]]. Dameron's X-wing was shot down,<ref name="PD11">''[[Poe Dameron 11: The Gathering Storm, Part IV]]''</ref> forcing the commander to retreat into a cave. With Dameron cornered, Terex and his gang moved into the cave.<ref name="PD12">''[[Poe Dameron 12: The Gathering Storm, Part V]]''</ref>

L'ampar and the rest of Black Squadron discovered Dameron's plight, and they flew to the [[desert]] planet, fighting the Ranc gang's "[[ugly]]" starfighters in battle. Black Squadron was outnumbered, and Kun's X-wing was hit, barely able to maintain flight. When L'ampar asked Kun about her status, she stated that she had lost her steering and that there were three enemy fighters heading toward her. Before the enemy ships could destroy Kun's fighter, they were obliterated by the ''Carrion Spike'', which had secretly been boarded and [[Saboteur|sabotaged]] by Muva, who had [[Programmer|reprogrammed]] the ship's [[targeting computer]]s.<ref name="PD13" />

[[File:RIP-Lulo.png|thumb|left|300px|L'ampar sacrifices himself to save the escape pods.]]
As Muva and a group of Terex's [[Slavery|slaves]] fled the [[flagship]] in [[escape pod]]s, the pilot requested an escort to the planet's surface. L'ampar and Black Squadron moved in to protect the escape pods, but one was destroyed by a Ranc gang ship. Appalled by the Ranc gang's merciless killing, L'ampar swooped in behind the enemy starfighters, shooting down the ships and proclaiming victory over them.<ref name="PD13" />

However, more enemy starships arrived behind L'ampar and shot down his A-wing, instantly killing the Duros veteran in a fiery explosion. Acknowledging L'ampar's sacrifice, Black Squadron continued to protect the escape pods. As the remaining pods reached the surface, a First Order [[Heavy cruiser|cruiser]] arrived to apprehend Terex, who had become a renegade from them. To the surprise of Black Squadron, the cruiser finished off Terex's criminal forces, and the Resistance starfighters left. In the battle's aftermath, Terex was taken captive by First Order Commander [[Malarus]], and Dameron, learning of L'ampar's death, began to process the loss of his friend.<ref name="PD13" />

===Legacy===
{{Quote|You want to talk ''luminous''? L'ulo L'ampar was about as luminous as they come. The ''stuff'' might be gone, but he's not. I can still feel him. Right here. Shining away. May the Force be with you, L'ulo.|Poe Dameron, concluding his eulogy|Poe Dameron 14: Legend Lost, Part I}}
Later, a [[Funeral of L'ulo L'ampar|funeral]] was held for L'ampar at the Resistance base, with his comrades mourning his death. General Organa began the [[funeral]] by remembering L'ampar as a fierce, dedicated warrior, and she invited Dameron to give the eulogy. Dameron began by speaking of the Force, and he told a story about [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]. Dameron explained that Kenobi was one of the last Jedi, and he had perished [[Rescue of Princess Leia|fighting]] evil, just as L'ampar had. Continuing, Dameron stated that when Kenobi had died, his body had vanished, leaving behind only [[Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber (Jedi Master)|his lightsaber]] and [[Jedi apparel|robes]]. Dameron then spoke of Skywalker, and how the latter had learned that individuals were not just flesh and [[bone]], but were "luminous." Placing his hand on the empty casket, Dameron finished his story, stating that when pilots die, they vanish just as the Jedi had, but they are not truly gone.<ref name="PD14" />

[[File:Funeral_of_Lulo_Lampar.png|thumb|right|300px|Dameron concludes his eulogy for L'ampar.]]
Dameron then discussed his past with L'ampar, explaining that the Duros had served as an uncle figure to him, and that L'ampar had been one of the best pilots he had ever met, never backing out of a fight. Stating that L'ampar was luminous, Dameron expressed how he could still feel L'ampar's presence. Dameron concluded the eulogy by saying "[[may the Force be with you]]," addressing both L'ampar and the gathered Resistance members.<ref name="PD14" /> In the time after the funeral, Black Squadron continued the search for Tekka,<ref name="PD20">''[[Poe Dameron 20: Legend Found, Part I]]''</ref> and the pilots eventually [[Rescue of Lor San Tekka|found]] the explorer in the [[Great Forveen Nebula]].<ref name="PD25">''[[Poe Dameron 25: Legend Found, Part VI]]''</ref>

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Imagine being one of those Duros who first reached for the [[star]]s. Something no one had seen. Just because they could.''"<br />"''There's always the Unknown Regions, after the Resistance wins the war.''"<br />"''It's a nice thought, but you don't get to choose what the galaxy needs pilots ''for''. Just ''why'' you fly.|L'ulo L'ampar and Poe Dameron|Poe Dameron Annual 2}}
[[File:Lulo-PDAnnual2.png|thumb|left|300px|L'ampar was a passionate pilot with a sense of humor.]]
A male, green-skinned Duros, L'ampar had red [[eye]]s and&mdash;according to himself&mdash;a relatively short, handsome face. L'ampar believed that spending time with family was important, and he often confronted Bey, asking her to spend more time with her husband and son. When Bey's husband had his resignation paperwork approved, L'ampar took the liberty of submitting Bey's, reassuring her that she had done her share for the Rebellion, and that mustering out was not desertion.<ref name="SE4" /> Following Bey's service, L'ampar kept in contact with her family, and he acted as an uncle to the young Dameron,<ref name="PD3" /> helping to raise the child.<ref name="PD14" /> Although L'ampar was concerned for Bey, the Duros had a lighthearted nature, frequently making jokes in serious situations.<ref name="SE2" />

During L'ampar's time with the Resistance, he disapproved of classified information being withheld from him, and he perceived that Organa still did not trust him despite their shared history. When L'ampar voiced this complaint, Kun joked that the Duros was an "old-timer" and was lucky to still be flying.<ref name="PD1" /> As a member of Black Squadron, L'ampar respected Dameron, praising the commander for trusting the squadron to improvise when needed, rather than giving them uninformed orders. The Duros saw that trait as the "mark of a good commander," validating this opinion through his prior experiences under poor leadership.<ref name="PD2" /> L'ampar believed that a war between the First Order and New Republic was inevitable, so during Black Squadron's first mission, he broke the rules of engagement and fired upon the enemy fighters. Following the mission, Dameron confronted L'ampar about his actions, but the Duros refused to apologize, arguing that a fighter destroyed then was one less to worry about later.<ref name="PD4" />

In his old age, L'ampar sometimes wished that he could slow down, and he reminisced about the ancient Duros pilots who explored space simply because they could. When Dameron suggested that L'ampar explore the galaxy's [[Unknown Regions]] after the war, the veteran admitted it was a good thought, but that the galaxy would decide his purpose.<ref name="PDA2" />

L'ampar was protective of his friends,<ref name="PD1" /> and he gave his life in a mission to rescue Dameron from Terex and the Ranc gang. In the battle, the gang's destruction of unarmed escape pods enraged L'ampar, and he vowed that no more would be destroyed, ultimately sacrificing himself in their defense. His actions saved the lives of several escaping slaves, as well as the life of Muva. The Resistance viewed L'ampar's death as a heroic sacrifice,<ref name="PD13" /> and his comrades remembered him for having a cranky, kind, crazy, and strong demeanor.<ref name="PD14" /> In the wake of L'ampar's death, his sacrifice became a rallying point for Black Squadron in their following missions.<ref name="PD15">''[[Poe Dameron 15: Legend Lost, Part II]]''</ref>

[[File:Lulos_A-wing.png|thumb|right|300px|L'ampar's skills as a veteran A-wing pilot were a notable contribution to Black Squadron.]]
L'ampar was one of the best pilots in the Rebellion,<ref name="CE Note">''[[Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded]]'' establishes that only the "very best [[rebel pilot]]s" can fly [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor|A-wings]].</ref> and he flew an A-wing interceptor through numerous Alliance campaigns.<ref name="SE4" /> Following the Battle of Endor, L'ampar became Green Leader, commanding the other pilots of Green Squadron.<ref name="SE1" /> During the battle in Cawa City, L'ampar saved Bey from a TIE fighter when her A-wing was damaged, and he also helped clear the approach for the bombers of Feral Group.<ref name="SE2" />

An [[Atmosphere|atmospheric]] flight maneuver called a L'ulo Stand<ref name="BTA" /> was named in L'ampar's honor,<ref name="Twitter" /> and Bey, having once witnessed it, described the maneuver to her son, Dameron.<ref name="BTA" /> Thirty years after the Battle of Endor, Dameron, who was recognized as the best pilot in the Resistance,<ref name="PD1" /> completed an improvised version of a L'ulo Stand in the [[vacuum]] of space, during a [[Skirmish in OR-Kappa-2722|skirmish]] against numerous forces of the First Order.<ref name="BTA" /> Less than a year later,<ref name="Date note">''[[Before the Awakening]]'' is set in the [[Standard month|months]] before [[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']], and it depicts [[Poe Dameron]] joining the [[Resistance]]. ''[[Poe Dameron 1: Black Squadron, Part I]]'' is set after Dameron has joined the Resistance, and it is also set before ''The Force Awakens''. Since Dameron requests L'ulo L'ampar to join [[Black Squadron (Resistance)|Black Squadron]] in ''Black Squadron, Part I'', it can be deduced that the request was made within a [[Standard year|year]] of ''Before the Awakening'', in which Dameron completes a [[L'ulo Stand]].</ref> Dameron personally requested L'ampar's participation in Black Squadron,<ref name="PD1" /> ranking the Duros among the best pilots of the Resistance.<ref name="PD4" /> With Black Squadron, L'ampar contributed to numerous successful Resistance missions.<ref name="PD4" /><ref name="PD6" /> In addition to piloting, L'ampar was capable with a [[blaster rifle]], and he used one to fend off assailants at the Megalox prison.<ref name="PD4" />

[[File:Star_Wars_Shattered_Empire_1_cover.jpg|thumb|right|200px|L'ulo L'ampar was developed for the comic book ''Shattered Empire, Part I''.]]
L'ulo L'ampar was introduced in ''[[Shattered Empire, Part I]]'', a [[Star Wars comic books|comic book]] written by [[Greg Rucka]], illustrated by [[Marco Checchetto]], and published on [[September 9]], [[2015]] by [[Marvel Comics]] as a part of [[Journey to Star Wars: The Force Awakens|Journey to ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'']].<ref name="Marvel Shattered Empire 1">{{Marvel|comics/issue/52678/journey_to_star_wars_the_force_awakens_-_shattered_empire_2015_1|Journey To Star Wars: The Force Awakens - Shattered Empire (2015) #1|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824032908/http://marvel.com/comics/issue/52678/journey_to_star_wars_the_force_awakens_-_shattered_empire_2015_1}}</ref> In ''[[Star Wars: Shattered Empire]]'', L'ampar is a supporting character, while the comic's protagonist, Shara Bey, is an A-wing pilot who flies second to him.<ref name="SE">''[[Star Wars: Shattered Empire]]''</ref> The inclusion of A-wing pilots as primary characters was made by Rucka, whose favorite movie starfighter is the A-wing.<ref name="IGN">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/09/how-greg-rucka-brought-balance-to-new-characters-and-old-in-star-wars-shattered-empire|title=How Greg Rucka Brought Balance to New Characters and Old in Star Wars: Shattered Empire|accessdate=2016-1-16|author=Joshua Yehl|date=2015-09-09|publisher=IGN|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108024803/http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/09/how-greg-rucka-brought-balance-to-new-characters-and-old-in-star-wars-shattered-empire|archivedate=2017-11-07}}</ref> In late 2015, ''[[Before the Awakening]]'', a junior novel written by Rucka, was published as a tie-in to [[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']]. In a segment centered on Poe Dameron,<ref name="BTA" /> the novel references L'ampar through the L'ulo Stand,<ref name="Twitter" /> although the character's name is misspelled as "L'ullo."<ref name="BTA" />

In [[2016]], L'ampar was featured as a supporting character in ''[[Star Wars: Poe Dameron]]'', an ongoing comic series written by [[Charles Soule]] and illustrated by [[Phil Noto]].<ref name="PD">''[[Star Wars: Poe Dameron]]''</ref> When asked about the relationship between L'ampar and Dameron, Soule stated that L'ampar was like an unorthodox uncle to Dameron, comparing the character to memorable relatives at [[Wikipedia:Thanksgiving|Thanksgiving]] reunions.<ref name="PD3" /> Throughout L'ampar's comic book appearances, the character gathered a fandom, which Soule was unaware of while writing ''[[Poe Dameron 13: The Gathering Storm, Part VI]]'', in which L'ampar dies. Soule felt that L'ampar's death was earned, tragic, and heroic, and he used L'ampar's funeral as a tribute to [[Carrie Fisher]],<ref name="Tosche Station">{{Cite_web|url=http://tosche-station.net/celebration-2017-interview-with-charles-soule/|title=Celebration 2017: Interview with Charles Soule|accessdate=2017-04-24|author=Bria|date=2017-04-19|publisher=Tosche Station|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108025043/http://tosche-station.net/celebration-2017-interview-with-charles-soule/|archivedate=2017-11-07}}</ref> who had passed away in late 2016.<ref name="Carrie Fisher">{{SW|url=news/carrie-fisher-our-princess-passes-away|text=Carrie Fisher, Our Princess, Passes Away|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120034119/http://www.starwars.com/news/carrie-fisher-our-princess-passes-away}}</ref> The funeral was depicted in ''[[Poe Dameron 14: Legend Lost, Part I]]'', and it provided the first instance of the surname "L'ampar."<ref name="PD14" />
