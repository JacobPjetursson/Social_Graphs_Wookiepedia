{{Quote|We are receiving a message from the Chancellor's office, sir.|Jeremoch Colton|Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith}}
'''Jeremoch Colton''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Sexes/Legends|male]] who served as the [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] of the ''[[Sundered Heart]]'' during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], and had a long record of service in the [[House of Organa/Legends|Royal House of Alderaan]]. He wore the same uniform as the rest of the ''Sundered Heart'' crew, and he had blond hair and blue eyes. He is not to be confused with [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Raymus Antilles/Legends|Raymus Antilles]], who had overall command of ''Sundered Heart'' and considered Colton to be his mentor.<ref name="EAWGG">''[[Star Wars: Empire at War: Prima Official Game Guide]]''</ref>

==Biography==
Colton had a long career as a pilot of the [[House of Organa/Legends|Royal House of Alderaan]]. At the end of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], he served under [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Raymus Antilles/Legends|Raymus Antilles]] on board the ''[[Sundered Heart]]'' during its return to [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] after [[Bail Prestor Organa|Bail Organa]] rescued [[Yoda/Legends|Yoda]] and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] during the execution of [[Order 66/Legends|Order 66]].

Colton was among the crew aboard the ''Sundered Heart'' when Bail Organa, Yoda, and Obi-Wan Kenobi went on the search for surviving [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]]. He answered the call of [[Mas Amedda/Legends|Mas Amedda]] when Bail Organa's presence in the Senate was asked by [[Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]]. Having learned the tricks of the trade, Colton planned to retire from active service and decided to teach at the [[University of Alderaan/Legends|University of Alderaan]] until it was destroyed [[Standard year/Legends|years]] later during the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]].<ref name="EAWGG" /> Presumably Colton was among the victims of Alderaan's destruction.<ref name="Galactic Files" />

==Behind the scenes==
Jeremoch Colton was played by [[Jeremy Bulloch]], the same actor who portrayed [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]] in the [[original trilogy]]. "Jeremoch" is an obvious portmanteau of his name.

The name Colton Antilles is given for Raymus Antilles in some sources, leading some fans to believe that the Captain Antilles in ''[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|A New Hope]]'' is a separate character named Colton Antilles, possibly named after the Captain Colton in ''[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]''. However, [[Leland Chee]] has confirmed that both Captains Antilles are meant to be the same person.<ref>[http://forums.starwars.com/thread.jspa?threadID=222689&start=1395 Leland Chee on the StarWars.com Message Boards]</ref><ref>[http://forums.starwars.com/thread.jspa?threadID=222689&start=1185 Leland Chee on the StarWars.com Message Boards]</ref>
