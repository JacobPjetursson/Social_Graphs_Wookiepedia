{{Quote|We can either decide right now that it's hopeless and call it a day, or we can hold out for hope and do what we can.|Berch Teller realized the odds stacked against his rebel cell were high but refused to give up|Tarkin (novel)}}
'''Berch Teller''' was a [[captain]] in [[Republic Intelligence]] who served on the [[moon]] [[Antar 4]] during the [[Clone Wars]]. He helped trained [[loyalist]] [[Gotal]] and [[Koorivar]] insurgent fighters who fought against the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. Following the Clone Wars, the new [[Galactic Empire]] unleashed a violent crackdown on Antar 4 which claimed the lives of many the loyalist fighters he had helped trained. Disillusioned with the [[New Order]], Teller and several Antar 4 survivors and Republic personnel formed a [[Berch Teller's rebel cell|rebel cell]] that fought against the Empire. Teller and his followers held a special animus for [[Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]], the architect of the "[[Antar Atrocity]]."

With the help of the opportunistic [[Vice Admiral]] [[Dodd Rancit]], Teller amassed several warships and numerous droid [[starfighter]]s.
In 14 BBY, Teller and his followers stole Tarkin's corvette ''[[Carrion Spike]]'' and launched a [[Berch Teller campaign|short-lived insurgency]] against the Empire; using hit-and-run strikes to target Imperial facilities across [[the galaxy]]. These attacks were broadcast on the [[HoloNet]], mimicking the Separatist [[Shadowfeed]] holovids of the Clone Wars. Teller's insurgency came to an end after Moff Tarkin and [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] discovered Rancit's collusion with Teller.

Having drawn away Imperial warships from the convoys ferrying supplies to the [[Death Star]] project, Teller and his followers [[Battle near the Gulf of Tatooine|ambushed]] an Imperial convoy near the [[Gulf of Tatooine]]. Despite their preparations, Tarkin came to the convoy's rescue and defeated Teller's forces. Teller escaped into [[hyperspace]] and later attempted to assassinate the newly-promoted [[Grand Moff]] Tarkin on his homeworld of [[Eriadu]]. However, Teller fell into a pit and the jubilant Tarkin left him inside, believing that Teller had little chance of survival.

==Biography==
===The Antar Atrocity===
During the [[Clone Wars]], Berch Teller served the [[Galactic Republic]] as a [[Republic Intelligence]] [[station chief]] with the rank of [[captain]]. He was one of the [[officer]]s that debriefed Captain [[Wilhuff Tarkin]] after [[Sexes|his]] [[Battle of Lola Sayu|escape]] from the [[Citadel]] with the coordinates to the [[Nexus Route]]. Under the oversight of [[Dodd Rancit]] and in association with [[Knotts]], a subcontractor from [[Lantillies]], he worked with loyalist beings on [[Planet|worlds]] that had joined or were occupied by the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]], training them to serve as resistance fighters for the Republic. In the war's final [[Standard year|year]], he was assigned to the [[Gotal]] [[moon]] of [[Antar 4]], organizing the Gotal and [[Koorivar]] partisans into well-armed resistance groups.<ref name="Tarkin" />

At the end of the war, he expected the [[Galactic Empire]] to spare them from punishment due to their work for the Republic during the conflict, and appealed to his superiors in the [[Imperial Intelligence]] community to provide documentation and [[transport]] for their extraction. However, [[Commission for the Preservation of the New Order|COMPNOR]] refused to cooperate, allowing forces under the command of now-[[Moff]] Tarkin to [[Death|kill]] many of the fighters on Antar 4 along with former Separatists, which became known as the [[Antar Atrocity]]. This event angered Teller and shortly after being assigned to [[Desolation Station]], which focused on research for the top-secret [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]] [[Project Stardust]]
|project]], he deserted the Empire.<ref name="Tarkin" />

===Forming a rebel cell===
With this disappearance, he created his own [[Berch Teller's rebel cell|resistance cell]] to fight against it, while intending to inspire the creation of other rebel groups throughout [[the galaxy]]. Teller's rebel cell consisted of individuals from several species including [[human]]s, Gotals, Koorivar, and at least one [[Mon Calamari]]. Several of his followers were the Gotal [[Salikk]], the Mon Calamari Dr. [[Artoz]], the Koorivar ops specialist [[Cala]], the human [[journalist]] [[Anora Fair]], and the [[Zygerrian]] [[Hask Taff]].<ref name="Tarkin" />

Teller's rebel cell was aided by [[Vice Admiral]] Dodd Rancit, the [[Director]] of the [[Naval Intelligence Agency]] and a rival of Moff Tarkin. Using his position as Director of Naval Intelligence, Rancit diverted funds from the agency's black budget to supply Teller's cell with proscribed armaments, confiscated Separatist war materiel, and communications jammers. Knowing that Teller and Knotts were former Republic Intelligence operatives, he also facilitated their access to Imperial depots and armories. Teller was also assisted by several disaffected technicians and scientists including Dr Artoz.<ref name="Tarkin" />

Teller kept the identity of his contact Rancit secret from his most trusted followers including Anora, Artoz, Cala, and Hask. With the help of the [[Tenloss Syndicate|Tenloss]] and [[Crymorah syndicate]]s, Teller also assembled a small fleet included a heavily modified [[Providence-class dreadnought|''Providence''-class dreadnought]] which served as [[Berch Teller's warship|his flagship]], an [[EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate]], several [[Z-95 Headhunter]]s and [[Tikiar (starfighter)|Tikiar]] starfighters, and a large number of [[Variable Geometry Self-Propelled Battle Droid, Mark I|Vulture droids]] and [[Droid tri-fighter]]s.<ref name="Tarkin" />

===Campaign against Tarkin===
====Raid on Sentinel Base====
In [[14 BBY]], Teller and his followers embarked on a campaign against Moff Tarkin for his role in the Antar Atrocity. By then, Tarkin was a rising star in the Imperial hierarchy who was privy to the [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine's]] top-secret [[Death Star]] project. Teller's forces tried to attack Tarkin's headquarters on [[Sentinel Base]] by creating a fake holo-transmission claiming that the nearby [[Rampart Station]] was under attack.<ref name="Tarkin" />

Teller then attacked Sentinel Base with his ''Providence''-class dreadnought and several Vulture droids and droid tri-fighters. However, Tarkin had seen through the ruse and ambushed the intruders with his [[Venator-class Star Destroyer|''Venator''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Electrum (Venator-class)|Electrum]]''. While Teller's warship was able to retreat, the Empire managed to capture several of Teller's droid starfighters.<ref name="Tarkin" />

====Stealing the ''Carrion Spike''====
{{Quote|You can think of the Carrion Spike as just a ship, but she's more than that. She's an expression of who Tarkin is; a small&ndash;scale example of the lengths he's willing to go. Stealth, speed, power... That's Tarkin, the omniscient, ubiquitous Imperial enforcer. And that's why we're turning her into a symbol of something else: of resistance.|Berch Teller, following the theft of the ''Carrion Spike''|Tarkin (novel)}}
When Tarkin and [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] visited [[Murkhana]] on a [[Mission to Murkhana|mission]] to investigate a communications cache, Teller and his followers hijacked Tarkin's [[Starship|vessel]], the ''[[Carrion Spike]]''. Teller wanted to use the ''Carrion Spike'', a symbol of Tarkin's power, against the Imperial Moff. Their plan was to raid Imperial targets across the galaxy and broadcast [[holovid]]s of their raids on the [[HoloNet]], mimicking the Separatist [[Shadowfeed]] [[propaganda]] broadcasts during the Clone Wars. In connivance with Teller, Vice-Admiral Rancit had planted and leaked information about the Murkhana communications cache to the Imperial authorities for the purpose of drawing Tarkin and Vader there.<ref name="Tarkin" />

Since the ''Carrion Spike'' relied on special [[fuel cell]]s, Knotts arranged for the Crymorah syndicate to supply the technology to their local affiliate [[Faazah]], a [[Sugi]] [[crime lord]]. After luring most of the ''Carrion Spike''{{'s}} [[stormtrooper]] sentries away using a fake transmission, Teller and his fellow insurgents stormed the ''Carrion Spike'' and killed the [[Unidentified Carrion Spike captain|ship's captain]] and [[Unidentified Carrion Spike comms officer|comms officer]] along with two stormtroopers before taking off.<ref name="Tarkin" />

While departing Murkhana, Teller met with his followers in the ''Carrion Spike''{{'s}} cockpit about their Imperial foes and their stolen ship. Before they could exit the edge of the [[Murkhana system]], Moff Tarkin and Darth Vader caught up in Faazah's requisitioned starship ''[[Parsec Predator]]''. Under Teller's command, the ''Carrion Spike'' jumped to the [[Fial system]]. However, Lord Vader was able to track down the rebels using [[Darth Vader's meditation chamber|his meditation chamber]] and a [[Paralight system]] concealed within the ship's [[hyperdrive]].<ref name="Tarkin" />

Upon detecting the ''Parsec Predator'', Teller suspected that there was a tracking device hidden aboard the ''Carrion Spike''. Hask suggested that the tracking device was located on the hull or concealed in a landing strut. Unable to do a full EVA search, Teller told his followers to hang on before telling Salikk to do a hyperspace jump. The insurgents resurfaced in the [[Fial system]] only to find the ''Parsec Predator'' in hot pursuit. Realizing that Vader was still able to track them, Teller told Salikk to do a hyperspace jump to [[Galidraan]].<ref name="Tarkin" />

====Waging an insurgency====
{{Quote|I was hoping they'd mistake the Predator for us, but Tarkin must still have limited comm. We must have put on quite a show for the station personnel.''"<br>"''The starfighters.|Teller and Salikk discussing the dogfight in the Galidraan system|Tarkin (novel)}}
Using the ''Carrion Spike''{{'s}} stealth technology and weapons systems, Teller and his followers attacked the Imperial [[Galidraan Station]] in the [[Galidraan system]], causing extensive damage to the station's outer ring. Since the ''Carrion Spike'' was cloaked, the station's particle-beam weapons emplacements were unable to hit the stealth ship. Galidraan Station then dispatched several [[Aggressive ReConnaissance-170 starfighter|ARC-170]] and [[Alpha-3 Nimbus-class V-wing starfighter|V-wing starfighters]], which attempted to force the enemy ship to reveal its location by flying directly at the source of the energy bolts targeting the station. This desperate tactic caused the lives of numerous Imperial pilots.<ref name="Tarkin" />

Using the meditation sphere, Darth Vader and Tarkin were able to track down the ''Carrion Spike''. Though they managed to close in on the stolen corvette using Vader's Force powers, Teller was able to disable the Imperials' ship ''Parsec Predator'' with the ''Carrion Spike''{{'s}} pintle guns. Despite knocking out their pursuers' ship, the ''Carrion Spike'' sustained significant damage to its systems during the skirmish including the short circuiting of its [[escape pod]]s' [[airlock]] controls, a cargo hold fire, and damage to the hyperdrive generator.<ref name="Tarkin" />

With Galidraan Station launching another squadron of starfighters, Teller tasked Salikk with preparing them for sublight travel while he headed down to the first cargo hold. There, he met Artoz who speculated that Darth Vader was using his black mediation sphere to track them down. After learning from Cala that the hyperdrive generator was ready to go, Teller told Salikk to navigate their jump point and to destroy Galidraan's [[Navigation buoy|hyperspace buoy]] on their way out to cover their trail. Working with Artoz, Teller managed to jettison the Darth Vader's meditation sphere. Before departing the Galidraan system, the Imperials destroyed the hyperspace buoy, preventing Tarkin and Vader from tracking them down.<ref name="Tarkin" />

Following the attack on Galidraan, Teller and his followers [[Attack on Lucazec|raided]] the [[TaggeCo]] mining facilities on [[Lucazec]]. The insurgents used an altered [[transponder]] signal and the ''Carrion Spike''{{'s}} stealth systems to sneak up on mining facility. During the raid, Teller and his insurgent inflicted substantial damage on the city-sized orbital processing plant and downed several V-wing starfighters and [[ore hauler]]s. The insurgents also broadcast holovids of their raid on the HoloNet, attracting the attention of the Emperor, the [[Imperial Ruling Council]], Moff Tarkin, and Lord Vader.<ref name="Tarkin" />

====Ordeal at Phindar====
{{Quote|On the bright side close calls make for captivating holovids.|Teller describing their narrow escape from Phindar|Tarkin (novel)}}
With the ''Carrion Spike'' running low on fuel, the insurgents then traveled to a remote system with a lifeless volcanic world. Having been warned by Vice-Admiral Rancit to avoid [[Gromas]] in the [[Perkell sector]], Teller and his followers decided to travel to the planet [[Phindar]] in the [[Mandalore sector]] to re[[fuel]] their stolen ship; which had special fuel requirements. For the refueling trip, Teller posed as the Imperial [[Commander]] [[Abel LaSal]] and dressed in an Imperial officer's uniform. Using his disguise and a stolen Imperial [[code cylinder]], Teller managed to convince the staff of the [[Phindar tanker facility]] to refuel the ''Carrion Spike''.<ref name="Tarkin" />

However, the Phindian Administrator became suspicious of his customers and alerted Moff Tarkin and Lord Vader. One of Tarkin's specialists aboard the [[Imperial escort carrier]] ''[[Goliath]]'' realized that the real Commander Abel LaSal was stationed aboard the [[Star Destroyer]] ''[[Sovereign]]'' above [[Fondor]]. Meanwhile, Teller suspected something was afoot due to the smooth nature of the refueling operation and ordered Anora to retract the transfer tube. Before they could leave the [[Phindar system]], Tarkin arrived in his escort carrier ''Goliath'' accompanied by the V-wing [[Yellow Squadron (Galactic Empire)|Yellow Squadron]] and Darth Vader's [[Darth Vader's black Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor|interceptor]].<ref name="Tarkin" />

Since they had a quarter of an hour before they could jump into hyperspace, Teller ordered to fly rings around the Phindar tanker in order to make it hard for their Imperial pursuers to target their hyperdrive generator. During the [[Battle in the Phindar system|dogfight]], the ''Carrion Spike'' managed to take out two of Tarkin's V-wings. The remaining Imperial fighters fired upon the ''Carrion Spike'' but were unable to penetrate the ship's powerful shield generators. As the dogfight escalated, the Phindar tanker deployed several ARC-170 starfighters to protect the tanker.<ref name="Tarkin" />

With the hyperdrive ready, the ''Carrion Spike'' hurtled away from the tanker and charged at the ''Goliath'', firing all its guns and taking out two more V-wings. After activating its cloaking device, the ''Carrion Spike'' jumped into hyperspace. Before leaving, Teller and his insurgents also used a concealed explosive within a spent [[fuel cell]] to ignite the Phindar tanker. The resulting explosion destroyed the tanker, its ARC-170 starfighters and singed the tails of Tarkin's V-wings.<ref name="Tarkin" />

====Why we fight====
{{Quote|...I don't need to remind any of you what Tarkin did at the end of the war when there weren't Jedi around to keep a lid on the violence and retribution. We wouldn't be aboard this ship [Carrion Spike] otherwise. The Emperor is going to winnow the populations of the galaxy until the only ones left are the ones he can control. And he and Vader and Tarkin are going to accomplish that with an army of steadfast recruits who might as well be clones for the little independent thinking they do, weapons that haven't been seen in more than a thousand years, and fear.|Teller informing his followers about their motives for fighting the Empire and stealing the ''Carrion Spike''|Tarkin (novel)}}
Teller and his crew brought the ''Carrion Spike'' to the [[Expansion Region]] [[sector]] designated as [[LCC-4-4-7]], which lay between the planets [[Aquaris]] and [[Thustra]]. The dogfight in the Phindar system caused significant damage to the ''Carrion Spike''{{'s}} hull and interior systems. Teller and his comrades gathered in the command cabin to nurse their wounds and fiddle with the starship instruments. Three [[standard hour|hours]] after the Phindar ordeal, Anora managed to upload a holovid of the dogfight on HoloNet. However, the Empire had suspended HoloNet service in most of their sector. Though Anora doubted that their transmission reached more than six star systems, Teller reassured her that they needed to reach one system for their holovid to spread to other sectors.<ref name="Tarkin" />

After discussing the events of the Phindar ordeal, Teller recounted Tarkin's service with the [[Outland Regions Security Force]] to his followers. Teller explained how Tarkin had used the Outland Regions Security Force to purge the [[Seswenna sector]] of pirates and those harboring them. He attributed Tarkin's ruthless streak to the [[Eriadu]]an culture and history of repelling pirates, [[slavery|slavers]], and privateers for centuries. However, Teller added that Tarkin went beyond the norms of Eriadu's ruthless culture by waging a ruthless campaign against migrants and refugees. He credited Tarkin's ruthless leadership with transforming Eriadu into a powerful house that won him the favor of the Emperor and his [[New Order]], who shared his ruthlessness.<ref name="Tarkin" />

Teller then reminded his followers Cala, Artoz, Salikk, and Hask of Tarkin's ruthless actions following the Clone Wars and the [[Jedi Purge]]. He added that the Emperor, his followers Vader and Tarkin, and soldiers were in the process of "winnowing" the populations of the galaxy until the only ones left were those he could control. Teller then reiterated that they had hijacked the ''Carrion Spike'' in order to turn a symbol of Tarkin into a symbol of resistance against the Empire. When Hask observed that their group was also killing civilians serving the Empire, Anora remarked that they were the "good guys."<ref name="Tarkin" />

====Covering their trail====
{{Quote|Why would the dissidents elect to send us a ship, in any case?''"<br>"''To throw us off the scent, if I recall your phrase correctly. To give us plenty to deal with while they're busy making plans to strike elsewhere.|Lord Vader and Tarkin discussing the Obroa-skai incident|Tarkin (novel)}}
While checking the ''Carrion Spike''{{'s}} hyperdrive and fuel capacity, the Koorivar Cala found a [[paralight tracker]], a type of HoloNet transceiver that parsed commands from the ship's [[navigation computer]]. Realizing that the Empire was tracking them, Teller instructed his crew to send the Empire fake coordinates to the [[Obroa-skai system]]. Teller also arranged for Knotts to send the [[YT-1000 light freighter]] ''[[Reticent]]'' as a decoy to the ''Carrion Spike''{{'s}} coordinates. Acting on this disinformation, Moff Tarkin and Lord Vader assembled several Imperial ships including three [[interdictor vessel]]s to intercept the stolen corvette.<ref name="Tarkin" />

However, the [[Immobilizer 418 cruiser]]'s [[gravity well projector]] malfunctioned, yanking out several starships from hyperspace including the [[MC80 star cruiser]] ''[[Stellar Vista]]'' and the ''Reticent''. This caused a [[Incident in the Obroa-skai system|massive hyperspace accident]] in the Obroa-skai system that damaged many civilian and Imperial ships and killed 1,100 passengers aboard the ''Stellar Vista''. Despite this setback, Tarkin and Vader managed to interrogate the crew of the ''Reticent'' and learned that Knotts was connected to both the Obroa-ski incident and the theft of the ''Carrion Spike''. Tarkin also compared the insurgents' holovids with Imperial files on HoloNet and discovered that Teller and his followers were seeking revenge against him for his role in the Antar Atrocity.<ref name="Tarkin" />

Following the Obroa-skai incident, Teller gave Cala the privilege of destroying the paralight tracker. Though Teler and his crew were dismayed that the Imperials had captured and questioned the crew of the ''Truant'', Teller was relieved when Vice-Admiral Rancit gave the corvette's crew were given a new target to [[Attack on the Nouane system|attack]]: an Imperial facility in the [[Nouane system]]. In private, Anora questioned Teller about their campaign and whether he trusted their mysterious contact. Teller kept the identity of Rancit hidden from his followers. When Anora asked Teller if he had any compassion for their "stand-ins" at Obroa-skai, Teller claimed that they knew the risks.<ref name="Tarkin" />

Anora then confided that she did not intend to become a revolutionary. Teller countered that she was already fighting the "good fight" with words before he had met her. After admitting that she was motivated by fame and fortune, Anora commented that she had underestimated COMPNOR and the Emperor's reach, power, and barbarity. Teller reassured Anora that she was not alone in underestimating the Emperor. When Anora expressed regret for dragging her friend Hask into trouble, Teller responded that they could always ask if she wanted to be dropped off but added that Hask would probably say no. Teller also reassured Anora that they were winning.<ref name="Tarkin" />

====Rancit's double-cross====
{{Quote|Besides, he had to make it look real.''"<br>"''They weren't just making it look real, Teller. Face facts: We're been betrayed.|Teller and Anora discussing Vice-Admiral Rancit's treachery|Tarkin (novel)}}
Since the Empire had deployed warships to protect the Imperial facility in the Nouane system, Teller had the ''Carrion Spike'' exit hyperspace deeper inside the system to avoid the capital ships. Despite Teller's planning, the Empire had fortified the Nouane facility. Encountering a withering hail of laserfire, Teller and his followers were forced to retreat aboard the ''Carrion Spike''. Unknown to Teller, his informant Vice-Admiral Rancit had attempted to betray and destroy Teller and his followers in an attempt to cover up his collusion with the insurgents. Rancit had hoped to exploit the crisis in order to improve his standing in the Imperial hierarchy.<ref name="Tarkin" />

Despite their narrow escape, the ''Carrion Spike'' sustained significant damage to its navicomputer, shields, stealth systems, sublight drives, and communications systems. The corvette's armament was down to two forward laser cannons and one starboard battery. Cala estimated that the hyperdrive motivator was only capable of two more jumps. While Teller initially believed that Rancit was trying to "make it look real", Anora pointed out that Rancit had betrayed them.<ref name="Tarkin" />

Since Rancit had instructed Teller and his insurgents to attack the [[Carida Academy|Imperial Academy]] on [[Carida]], Teller realized that the Vice-Admiral was planning to lure them into another trap for good. As the ''Carrion Spike''{{'s}} autopilot was still operational, Teller and his followers evacuated the ship and sent the corvette on autopilot to Carida. Above Carida, Vice-Admiral Rancit waited aboard the [[Secutor-class Star Destroyer|''Secutor''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Conquest]]'' to intercept and destroy the insurgents, covering his tracks.<ref name="Tarkin" />

However, Lord Vader and Moff Tarkin had discovered Rancit's treachery. Darth Vader boarded the ''Conquest'' and stopped the Vice-Admiral from ordering the destruction of the ''Carrion Spike''. After confronting Rancit for his opportunism, the [[Sith Lord]] forced Rancit to board an escape pod and issue the order to destroy his craft.<ref name="Tarkin" />

====Ambush in the Gulf of Tatooine====
{{Quote|Tell Anora and Hask that we expect nothing less than a galactic-class holovid.|Berch Teller prior to ambushing the Imperial convoy ferrying supplies to the Death Star project|Tarkin (novel)}}
Berch Teller and his followers rejoined their comrades including Knotts aboard his modified ''Providence''-class carrier near a cratered moon in the [[Gulf of Tatooine]]. Artoz had received intelligence that an Imperial convoy of ships carrying supplies for the top-secret Death Star project would exit hyperspace in that system while traveling to the Imperial marshaling station at [[Pii]]. Unaware of Rancit's death, Teller believed that the Empire had not yet uncovered Rancit's treachery and that the Empire thought they had abandoned their cause.<ref name="Tarkin" />

When Knotts warned that Rancit would be hunting them down for betraying him, Teller speculated that Rancit withdrawing ships from protecting the convoy would threaten his position in Naval Intelligence. Teller also believed that Tarkin would not be held accountable for the insurgents' attacks and would keep his command of Sentinel Base. When Knotts warned that Tarkin would come after them, Teller suggested fleeing to the [[Corporate Sector]]. While the insurgents were unaware of the Death Star project, Artoz believed that raiding the convoy would set the Empire back by four years.<ref name="Tarkin" />

Though Teller hope that their strikes against the Empire would eventually inspire rebellion, Artoz believed that the Empire still had an overwhelming advantage due to its mighty war machine. Despite the odds stacked against them, Teller urged his followers to hold out for hope and do what they could. As the insurgent pilots headed to their starfighters, Cala informed Teller and his comrades that the supply convoy had exited hyperspace and that their HoloNet and communication jammers were enabled. As he donned his helmet, Teller told Cala to tell Anora and Hask that he expected a galactic-class holovid.<ref name="Tarkin" />

After jamming the convoy's HoloNet and communications relays, the insurgents bombarded the enemy convoy and unleashed their starfighters. For this attack, Teller's forces included his modified former Separatist carrier, an EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate, multiple droid tri-fighters, and four Z-95 Headhunters and Tikiar starfighters. Though the convoy's escort gunboats and frigates formed a defensive perimeter around the transports, Teller's droid starfighters were able to dart through gaps and swarm the Imperial ships, destroying two tugs, two escort gunboats, and several ARC-170 starfighters.<ref name="Tarkin" />

====Escaping to fight another day====
{{Quote|Listen to her. For my part, I'll always be grateful for the extra years you gave me after Antar.''"<br>"''You dumb, flat-faced space jockey!''"<br>"''I'm transmitting jump coordinates to your fighter. Ease out of the fight while Tarkin is concentrating on us. The Headhunter's hyperdrive will do the rest.|Salikk convincing Teller to escape to fight another day|Tarkin (novel)}}
Despite Teller and his associates' careful preparations, the tide of the battle turned against them when Moff Tarkin arrived aboard the Imperial Star Destroyer ''[[Executrix]]''. Tarkin used the ''Executrix''{{'s}} massive firepower to destroy Teller's Nebulon-B frigate before deploying V-wing starfighters to pick off Teller's droid fighters and to protect the convoy ships. Having safeguarded the Imperial convoy, Tarkin then unleashed the ''Executrix''{{'s}} cannons against Teller's flagship.<ref name="Tarkin" />

As the Imperial forces gained the upper hand, Teller and a Koorivar Tikiar pilot were the only organic starfighter pilots left. After several attempts, Teller managed to contact Salikk. He told Salikk to jump their carrier into hyperspace and get clear of that Star Destroyer. However, Salikk responded that they were already committed. Anora then urged Teller to escape to fight another day. Teller disagreed but Salikk convinced Teller to listen to Anora. He added that allowing Teller to escape would be his gratitude for helping him survive the Antar Atrocity.<ref name="Tarkin" />

Despite Teller's protests, Salikk transmitted a series of hyperspace jump coordinates to his starfighter. Heeding his followers' words, Teller escaped aboard his Headhunter into hyperspace. Meanwhile, Tarkin's Star Destroyer disabled Teller's carrier and boarded it, capturing Teller's surviving followers. Teller landed on the crystal planet of [[Christophsis]] before disappearing into hiding. Imperial forces later discovered the starfighter. In the wake of the battle near the gulf of Tatooine, the Empire executed Teller's followers. The newly promoted [[Grand Moff]] Tarkin also tightened security around the Death Star project and exacted a heavy price against the workers, salvagers, scientists, and criminal elements who had aided Teller's rebels.<ref name="Tarkin" />

====Confronting his nemesis====
{{Quote|Broken ankle or no, he seems capable enough to escape. Do you want me to keep an eye on him, perhaps provide a hint or two of the lay of the land to better his chances''"<br>"''That might be interesting. You be the judge.|Jova and Wilhuff Tarkin quipping about Teller's chances of escape and survival|Tarkin (novel)}}
After escaping Christophsis, Berch Teller tracked down Grand Moff Tarkin to the [[Carrion Plateau]] on his homeworld of Eriadu. The Carrion Plateau was situated on the lands of the Tarkin family. When Tarkin visited the Carrion Plateau to seek solitude, Teller attempted to sneak up on the Grand Moff but fell into a pit trap. Though the sharpened stakes at the bottom had long rotted to mulch, Teller still sustained a broken ankle. Tarkin's uncle [[Jova Tarkin|Jova]] discovered Teller in the pit and alerted his nephew Tarkin.<ref name="Tarkin" />

Tarkin met with his twice-defeated nemesis, telling Teller that he had baited him by intentionally leaving his stormtroopers behind in [[Eriadu City]]. Teller accepted that he had taken the bait as that was the only chance he had of shooting the Grand Moff. When Tarkin mocked him for missing earlier opportunities to shoot him, Teller responded that he wanted them to be looking each other in the eye when he killed him. Teller then quipped that Jova would have still have shot him first.<ref name="Tarkin" />

After exchanging conversation with his uncle, Tarkin turned his attention back to Teller. When Tarkin claimed that Teller was seeking to splinter the galaxy again, Teller countered that subjugating the Separatists was practice for subjugating the galaxy. Tarkin claimed this was pacification but Teller countered that it was "rule by fear". When Teller denounced Tarkin as a monster, Tarkin responded that he was only a monster from a certain point of view and described himself as a product of the plateau. Teller asked about the Imperial project on Geonosis but Tarkin refused to divulge Imperial secrets to a foe.<ref name="Tarkin" />

Before leaving, Tarkin offered to let Teller escape if he could climb out of the pit before nightfall; knowing that Teller stood little chance of surviving the dangerous predators that inhabited Carrion Spike. Rejecting Tarkin's offer, Teller cursed Tarkin, telling him that he would die a horrible death. Tarkin dismissed Teller's threats, claiming that he held the upper hand while Teller was trapped in a deep hole and crippled. After they finished, Tarkin and Jova left him in the wilderness to see if he could get out of it alive after nightfall.<ref name="Tarkin" />

===Legacy===
Despite failing to kill Grand Moff Tarkin personally, Berch Teller's prophecy that Tarkin would die a "horrible death"<ref name="Tarkin" /> came to fruition during the [[Battle of Yavin]] [[0 ABY|fourteen years later]]. Tarkin was killed aboard his Death Star superweapon when the [[Force-sensitive]] [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] starfighter pilot [[Luke Skywalker]] fired a [[proton torpedo]] into the superweapon's [[thermal exhaust port]].<ref name="ANH">[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]</ref>

Ultimately, Teller and his followers' efforts would not be in vain. Some time after Teller's campaign, the Rebel Alliance saw Teller as a prime example of how counter-propaganda would be useful, and that if it weren't for him, the galaxy would not be aware of the Antar Atrocity.<ref name="Rebel Files">''[[Star Wars: The Rebel Files]]''</ref> Following the death of the Emperor and Vader during the [[Battle of Endor]] in [[4 ABY]],<ref name="ROTJ">[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]</ref> the Empire ultimately collapsed at the [[Battle of Jakku]] a [[5 ABY|year later]].<ref name="TFAVD">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref>

{{Quote|Teller, sometimes you are so straight out of a holodrama I can't decide whether to cheer or applaud. My production team on Coruscant would have made good use of you.|Anora Fair complementing Teller for his passionate zeal|Tarkin (novel)}}
Berch Teller was a tall, slim, middle-aged human male with dark hair and eyebrows. He had a long face covered with stubble and a cleft chin. Teller was a natural leader who was able to inspire his followers to fight. He used these skills to lead loyalist fighters on Antar 4 during the Clone Wars and later a group of anti-Imperial insurgents during the Imperial period. Teller regarded the Empire as a tyrannical dictatorship built on the subjugation of the galaxy's inhabitants. Teller developed a hatred of the Empire and Grand Moff Tarkin in particular for their role in the indiscriminate slaughter of Antar 4's inhabitants including Republic loyalists following the Clone Wars.<ref name="Tarkin" />

Teller believed that the Clone Wars served as a pretext for the Emperor to take over the galaxy. He also believed that the Emperor and his chief disciples Darth Vader and Moff Tarkin were determined to subjugate all beings in the galaxy. He regarded the soldiers of the vastly expanded Imperial military as an army of beings who had been stripped of independent thinking; weapons that had not been seen for thousands of years. Teller regarded Tarkin as the embodiment of some of the worst aspects of the Empire and sought to kill him personally.<ref name="Tarkin" />

Teller's followers including Anora, Knotts, Cala, Salikk, and Hask looked up to him as a mentor and leader. Though Teller was willing to buy time for his comrades to escape, their respect for him let him to convince him to escape to fight another day. Teller was resourceful enough to infiltrate Tarkin's homeworld of Eriadu but fell into a pit trap. In the face of defeat, Teller remained defiant towards Tarkin and cursed Tarkin to die a horrible death. He maintained his constitutional resolve that the Empire was a force for evil and would one day meet its end.<ref name="Tarkin" />

Teller was also known for his passionate zeal and gave several talks "educating" his followers about why they were fighting Tarkin and the Emperor. This once led Anora to joke that he would make a good [[holodrama]] actor. Teller was known for his colorful language and once chastised Salikk for risking his own life to save him. However, Teller accepted his followers' willingness to sacrifice their life for him so that he could escape and hunt down Tarkin.<ref name="Tarkin" />
