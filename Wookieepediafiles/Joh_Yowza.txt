'''Joh Yowza''' was a [[Sexes|male]] [[Yuzzum]] performer for the [[Max Rebo Band]]. He often performed duets with [[Sy Snootles]].<ref name="Joh Yowza" /> Shortly before the [[Battle of Endor]], Yowza and the rest of the band performed at [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the [[Hutt|Hutt's]] [[Jabba's Palace|palace]] on the [[planet]] [[Tatooine]].<ref name="ROTJ">[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]</ref> Among Jabba's courtiers, there were many people who disliked Yowza's voice and dreamed of silencing him brutally. The Hutt, however, appeared to like the Yuzzum singer, and Jabba's opinion was the only one that mattered in his palace.<ref name="beware">''[[Return of the Jedi: Beware the Power of the Dark Side!]]''</ref>
