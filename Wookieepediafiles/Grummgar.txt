'''Grummgar''' was a [[Dowutin]] [[Sexes|male]] who worked as a [[big game hunter]] and [[mercenary]] active around thirty [[Standard year|years]] after the [[battle of Endor]]. After being left to live on his own at a young age, like all Dowutins, Grummgar acquired considerable hunting skills and eventually contracted work to hunt down a predatory [[molsume]], native to the jungles of the [[planet]] [[Ithor]]. Despite the illegality of hunting on Ithor, Grummgar tracked molsumes for a period of time before he encountered fellow game hunter [[Nysorly]]. After regarding each other as potential competition, both hunters were able to walk away with their own molsume pelts. Sometime later Grummgar visited the [[Maz Kanata's castle|castle]] of the [[pirate]] [[Maz Kanata]] on the planet [[Takodana]]. Grummgar spent his time there with fellow mercenary [[Bazine Netal]] and was present when the forces of the [[First Order]] [[Battle of Takodana|attacked and destroyed]] the castle.

==Biography==
===Big game hunter===
{{Quote|You are a professional hunter? I've put out bait bigger than you.''"<br />"''I wouldn't be surprised. Something as big and clumsy as you would likely have to resort to bait.|Grummgar and Nysorly|Bait}}
[[File:Grummgar and Bazine.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Grummgar and [[Bazine Netal]] inside Maz Kanata's castle.]]
A large [[Sexes|male]] [[Dowutin]], Grummgar went off to live on his own at a young age, as all Dowutins did. He went on to acquire skills in the fields of [[hunting]] and tracking, and eventually took up the career of a [[big game hunter]].<ref name="Bait" /> Grummgar frequented the [[Maz Kanata's castle|castle]] of the [[pirate]] [[Maz Kanata]] on the [[planet]] [[Takodana]], gathering hunting tips from explorers of [[Wild Space]] and the [[Unknown Regions]]. He often traveled to unexplored worlds he had heard of in his search for new predators to hunt.<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" /> At some point Grummgar was hired to hunt down and bering back the pelt of a [[molsume]]&mdash;a predatory creature native to the [[jungle]]s of the [[planet]] [[Ithor]]. Despite the fact that it was illegal to hunt on Ithor in such a manner, Grummgar accepted the contract and hunted molsumes for a period of [[time]], using a [[speeder]] for [[transport]] and a [[242 hunting rifle]] as his weapon of choice. Eventually, Grummgar discovered the seemingly defenseless [[human]] [[Nysorly]]. Realizing that she would make the perfect bait for a molsume, Grummgar hid his presence from her and waited for a molsume to seek her out. One eventually did, and too Grummgar's surprise Nysorly pulled out a [[shortblaster]] and shot the molsume [[Death|dead]].<ref name="Bait" />

Impressed, Grummgar opted to introduce himself and congratulate the girl on her kill. However, Nysorly interpreted Grummgar as a rival and threatened to shoot him. Grummgar tried to calm her nerves, which only resulted in the two voicing ideas of how they could outsmart and either directly or indirectly kill the other. As they bantered, a second molsume preyed on Nysorly from behind. Noticing this, Grummgar spat in Nysorly's direction. The human, believing that the spittle could be [[Poison|toxic]], jumped out of the way and fired her shortblaster at Grummgar's speeder as he fired past her, killing the second molsume. Only after reloading to finish Grummgar off did Nysorly turn and notice that the Dowutin had actually saved her. She thanked Grummgar, who was no worse for wear after having his speeder shot out form under him. The two shared their new mutual respect for each other, and Nysorly explained how she had been forced to enter a dangerous lifestyle after being left to live alone at a young age, an origin story similar to Grummgar's own.<ref name="Bait" />

Summarily, the hunters were both content with the fact that they both had their own molsume pelts. Grummgar offered to carry the molsumes, and Nysorly in return promised Grummgar to help him skin his pelt, as his hands were too large to procure a clean final product. After turning down a partnership offer, Grummgar told Nysorly that he expected compensation for his damaged speeder.<ref name="Bait" />

===The castle of Maz Kanata===
Around thirty [[Standard year|years]] after the [[Battle of Endor]], he spent time in Maz Kanata's castle with the [[mercenary]] [[Bazine Netal]], whom he assumed was attracted to him, being too self-centered to consider she might have another agenda. The pair sat together near the castle's door, with Netal on Grummgar's massive lap, from where she had a view of everything going on in the castle.<ref name="TFAVD" /> When the [[smuggler]] [[Han Solo]] arrived at the castle with the [[scavenger]] [[Rey]], the former [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtrooper]] [[Finn]], and the [[astromech droid]] [[BB-8]], Netal recognized the [[droid]] as one the [[First Order]] was after. Whispering into Grummgar's ear, she slid off his lap and left to report the droid's whereabouts to the First Order. The patrons of the castle rushed outside soon after Netal left, as the [[Hosnian Cataclysm|destruction]] of the [[Hosnian system]] by the First Order's [[Starkiller Base]] [[superweapon]] was visible and audible from Takodana. The castle itself was then [[Battle of Takodana|attacked]] and destroyed based on Netal's report.<ref name="Episode VII">[[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']]</ref>

==Personality and traits==
Grummgar was obsessed with trophies, be they parts taken from exotic animals illegally poached, or woman attracted to his brute magnetism. He had [[Color|yellow]] skin and wore a yellow outfit over it with a brown [[Clothing|jacket]]. He carried a [[hunting rifle]] with a remote trigger interface and a [[sniper]] barrel [[flash suppressor]].<ref name="TFAVD" />

Although unscrupulous, Grummgar preferred to hunt wild animals over [[Sentience|sentient]] beings, happily hunting endangered, rare quarry, even on nature preserves and sacred ground. Aid's reports of remote planets filled with lethal predators filled him with a giddy, childlike joy, and he eagerly returned from untamed worlds with tales as tall as himself.
