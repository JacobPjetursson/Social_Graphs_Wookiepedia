{{Quote|Let the past die. Kill it if you have to. That's the only way to become what you were meant to be.|Kylo Ren|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}
'''Kylo Ren''', a [[Force-sensitive]] [[human]] [[Sexes|male]], was the [[Supreme Leader]] of the [[First Order]] and [[Master of the Knights of Ren]] during the [[New Republic Era|era of the New Republic]]. Once a promising [[Padawan|student]] of [[Jedi Master]] [[Luke Skywalker]], the former '''Ben Solo''' was neither [[Jedi]] or [[Sith]] but a product of both orders' teachings. Though he embraced the [[dark side of the Force]] due to the machinations of his predecessor, Supreme Leader [[Snoke]], Ren remained vulnerable to the pull of the [[light side of the Force]]. Nevertheless, he was determined to destroy the last remnants of the [[Jedi Order]] and also charted his own path to power, believing it was destiny to rule [[the galaxy]].

The son of [[General]] [[Han Solo]] and [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Organa]], Ben Solo was [[Reproduction|born]] on the [[Core Worlds|Core World]] [[Chandrila]], on the [[Standard day|day]] the [[Galactic Empire]] [[Galactic Concordance|surrendered]] to the [[New Republic]] in [[5 ABY]]. Though he was given his [[Parent|father's]] [[Solo (family)|surname]], Solo was a [[Skywalker (family)|Skywalker]] through his mother. He, therefore, inherited the raw strength of his maternal grandfather, [[Anakin Skywalker]], the [[Chosen One]] of [[the Force]]. As his own [[Force power|powers]] manifested in the [[Standard year|years]] following the [[Galactic Civil War]], Solo became part of a new generation of [[Jedi Knight]]s [[Jedi training|trained]] by his maternal uncle, Luke Skywalker. Despite the potential Skywalker saw in his nephew, he also sensed darkness and grew to believe that Snoke succeeded in turning Solo to the dark side. Acting on instinct, Skywalker was prepared to end Solo's life before his future came to pass but could not follow through with the act. Solo felt betrayed, however, and reacted by [[Fire|burning down]] the [[Luke Skywalker's Jedi Temple|training temple]], resulting in the [[Destruction of Luke Skywalker's Jedi Temple|massacre]] of the other apprentices as well as Skywalker's [[Exile (punishment)|self-imposed exile]] on the [[planet]] [[Ahch-To]].

By severing his ties with Skywalker and the Jedi, Solo pledged his loyalty to Snoke and reemerged as Kylo Ren&mdash;the '''Jedi Killer''', [[warlord]] and champion of the First Order, and Master of the [[Knights of Ren]]. In the waning days of the [[cold war]], Ren oversaw the [[Hunt for Lor San Tekka|hunt]] for the [[Map to Skywalker|map]] to Skywalker; his intention to [[Death|kill]] the last Jedi and, therefore, complete the [[Jedi Purge|legacy]] of the fallen [[Sith Lord]] [[Darth]] Vader, his grandfather's dark side persona. This journey ultimately led to Ren's [[Battle of Takodana|encounter]] with the [[Jakku]] [[scavenger]] [[Rey]], whose own strength in the Force mirrored Ren's, and with whom he shared an unprecedented [[Force-bond]] with. They became allies as their connection grew stronger following [[Starkiller Base]]'s [[Battle of Starkiller Base|destruction]] in [[34 ABY]], leading to the [[Attack on the Resistance fleet|assassination of Snoke]] during the [[First Order–Resistance war]]. With ambition [[fuel]]ed by the dark side, however, Ren claimed the mantle of Supreme Leader and continued to pursue his goal of [[Galaxy|galactic]] domination, causing Rey to withdraw her support despite Ren entreating her to rule by his side. At this point, [[Hosnian Cataclysm|the New Republic had fallen]]; the [[Resistance]], a group of insurgents led by Ren's mother, was decimated at the [[Battle of Crait]]; and Skywalker [[Force spirit|became one with the Force]] upon sacrificing his life to save the last remnants of the Resistance.

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Quote|I know where you come from. Before you called yourself Kylo Ren.|Lor San Tekka, to Kylo Ren|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}
[[File:Han Leia and Ben.jpg|thumb|left|243x243px|Ben Solo, son of General Han Solo and Princess Leia Organa, was born one year after the Battle of Endor.]]
The voice of Kylo Ren was heard by the [[Jedi]] [[Ezra Bridger]], who visited the [[world between worlds]]&mdash;a mystical plane that existed between [[time]] and [[Realspace|space]]&mdash;in [[1 BBY]], several [[Standard year|years]] before Ren's [[Reproduction|birth]].<ref name="A World Between Worlds">{{Rebels|A World Between Worlds}}</ref> He was born as Ben Solo<ref name="Golden Book">[[The Force Awakens (Golden Book)|''The Force Awakens'' Golden Book]]</ref> in [[Hanna City]], [[Chandrila]] on the [[Standard day|day]] that the [[Galactic Concordance]] was signed between the [[New Republic]] and the [[Galactic Empire]], formally ending the [[Galactic Civil War]]. This day was roughly [[5 ABY|one year]] after the [[Battle of Endor]],<ref name="Empire's End" /> in which his [[parent]]s, [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Organa]] and [[General]] [[Han Solo]], led the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] in a decisive victory over the Empire. Their victory resulted in the [[death]]s of the [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]], Darth Sidious, and Organa's biological father, the [[Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]].<ref name="Episode VI">[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]</ref>

While he was still in his mother's womb, Organa could feel him through [[the Force]]. She likened him to a living band of light that sometimes dimmed and was sometimes thrust through with a vein of darkness. Following his birth, there were contradictory rumors that Ben's birth took three days. Another tale claimed that it was a fast and painless birth. There were also rumors that Ben was born with a shock of black hair and a full set of teeth. Though Han lacked the same Force bond that Organa had with her son, he comforted himself with the fact that he had a fatherly bond with Ben.<ref name="Empire's End" /> As a [[Youngling|toddler]], Ben enjoyed playing with the [[gold]] [[Han Solo's dice|dice]] that belonged to his father and would often follow him around.<ref name="Expanded Edition">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: Expanded Edition]]''</ref>

[[File:HelmetWarrantyVoided-TFAT2.png|thumb|right|225x225px|Solo's heritage as the grandson of Darth Vader was kept hidden from him by his parents.]]
The namesake of Ben's first name was that of the late [[Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], who went by the name of Ben Kenobi while in [[Exile (punishment)|exile]] on [[Tatooine]] after the [[Jedi Purge|fall]] of the [[Jedi Order]] at the end of the [[Clone Wars]] and who sacrificed his life while [[Rescue of Princess Leia|rescuing]] his mother from the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]] [[battle station]] in [[0 BBY]].<ref name="Episode IV">[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]</ref> Ben's surname, that of his father, was originally coined by [[chief]] [[Imperial Recruitment Officer|recruitment officer]] [[Drawd Munbrin]] in [[13 BBY]] on [[Corellia]] for Han when he enlisted for the [[Carida Academy]] to become a [[pilot]].<ref name="Solo">''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]''</ref> As an infant, Ben had difficulty falling asleep. His father would hold him close in an effort to help Ben sleep. He also introduced his son to a children's holoshow cartoon called ''[[Moray and Faz]]''. One night, two years after the fall of the Empire, [[Chancellor (New Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Mon Mothma]] contacted the Solo house in an attempt to speak with Organa. The household [[droid]], [[T-2LC]], informed Han and activated a holo-projection of the chancellor. In doing so, the droid awoke both father and son, much to the former's annoyance as it had been the first time Ben had slept in days, or so it seemed to Han. The disturbance caused Ben to wake up crying, to which his father responded sympathetically by holding his son close to his chest. After a few moments, Ben drifted back to sleep, his chin resting on his father's shoulder.<ref name="Last Shot">''[[Last Shot]]''</ref>

In his youth, Ben's parents had active lives in their respective professions. Han, a [[smuggler]] before joining the Rebellion, was unable to stay in one place for long.<ref name="Secrets of TFA breakdown">{{Cite web|url=http://makingstarwars.net/2016/03/secrets-of-the-force-awakens-a-cinematic-journey-breakdown/|title=Secrets of The Force Awakens: A Cinematic Journey Breakdown!|first=Jason|last=Ward|work=Making Star Wars|date=March 14, 2016|accessdate=March 19, 2016}}</ref> Ben, who aspired to become a pilot like his father since childhood,<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> inherited amazing piloting skills from him.<ref name="StealthMission">''[[Stealth Mission: Book and Model – Make Your Own X-wing]]''</ref> Organa, meanwhile, became a respected [[senator]] in the New Republic,<ref name="Bloodline" /> the [[Politics|government]] that arose after the Battle of [[Endor]] and that had served the Empire a final defeat during the [[Battle of Jakku]] around the time of Ben's birth.<ref name="Lost Stars">''[[Lost Stars]]''</ref> Organa and Solo's natures clashed, and their busy lives left Ben with feelings of abandonment.<ref name="Secrets of TFA breakdown" />

===Jedi training===
{{Quote|For many years, there was balance and then I saw Ben. My nephew with that mighty Skywalker blood. In my hubris, I thought I could train him; I could pass on my strengths. Han was ''Han'' about it, but&hellip; Leia trusted me with her son. I took him and a dozen students, and began a training temple.|Luke Skywalker, to Rey|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}
[[File:Luke Skywalker Jedi Master VII.jpg|thumb|left|247x247px|Solo's raw Force potential convinced his uncle, Luke Skywalker, that the time had come to restore the Jedi Order to its former glory.]]
Ben proved to be [[Force-sensitive]], taking after his mother,<ref name="Royal Rebel">''[[Princess Leia: Royal Rebel]]''</ref> as well as his uncle and grandfather. Growing up, Ben was unaware of his true lineage&mdash;that he was the grandson of [[Darth]] Vader. Only his parents and Organa's [[twin]] brother, Jedi Master [[Luke Skywalker]], knew the truth of Anakin Skywalker's past. Organa decided to keep the truth from Ben but planned to tell him when he was older, though by the age of twenty-three he still did not know his grandfather's real identity. She nonetheless hoped that she could tell her son the truth, and that Skywalker could explain that, in the end, Vader was redeemed and that the light inside of Anakin Skywalker had returned. By the same age, Ben had begun [[Jedi training|training]] with Skywalker as one of the [[Padawan|students]] in his uncle's new generation of Jedi,<ref name="Bloodline" /> which the Jedi Master was training in the hopes of restoring the Jedi Order. Organa recognized similarities between Ben and Darth Vader and hoped that Skywalker's training could help her son.<ref name="Episode VII" />

[[File:Luke Skywalkers Jedi temple.png|thumb|right|271x271px|Skywalker started a training temple where his nephew and the other apprentices could learn the Jedi arts under his supervision.]]
In his late teens, Ben was eventually<ref name="EW-KylovsRey">{{Cite web|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/11/19/star-wars-kylo-ren-vs-rey-the-last-jedi/|title=Kylo Ren vs. Rey: In The Last Jedi, the danger is becoming allies instead of enemies|first=Anthony|last=Breznican|work=[[wikipedia:Entertainment Weekly|Entertainment Weekly]]|date=November 19, 2017|accessdate=November 19, 2017}}</ref> targeted by a powerful individual named [[Snoke]]&mdash;the [[Supreme Leader]] of the [[First Order]] that arose from the ashes of the Imperial remnants that had retreated into the [[Unknown Regions]] at the end of the [[Galaxy|Galactic]] Civil War&mdash;who recognized the inherent Force potential within Ben Solo, as Ben was a member of the powerful [[Skywalker (family)|Skywalker family]] through his mother, and used Ben's feelings of abandonment as a tool to seduce him.<ref name="TFA VD">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> It was through Ben that Snoke also targeted Skywalker in a calculated effort to break him by destroying the Jedi Order, which he indirectly convinced Skywalker to restore.<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> Snoke saw Ben as a focal point between the [[Light side of the Force|light side]] and the [[dark side of the Force]]&mdash;an ideal embodiment of a Force warrior&mdash;and wanted to take him as an apprentice of his own.<ref name="TFA VD" />

Twenty-four years after the Battle of Endor, the [[Inner Rim]] planet of [[Birren]], settled by [[Scout|explorers]] from [[Alderaan]] and [[Arkanis]], suffered the death of its ruling monarch, [[Lord]] [[Mellowyn]]. His closest living relative was Senator Organa, who was not interested in its [[Supreme governor|governorship]]&mdash;nor did she believe that Ben would be interested in succeeding her one day. The title passed to Lady [[Carise Sindian]]. Shortly thereafter, the truth about Organa's parentage was revealed by her political enemies, including Lady Sindian, in the [[Galactic Senate (New Republic)|Galactic Senate]]. Organa had yet to tell her son about Darth Vader, and she worried about how he would react after finding out about it in such a public way.<ref name="Bloodline" />

===Fall to the dark side===
====Skywalker's betrayal====
{{Quote|He had sensed my power, as he senses yours. And he ''feared'' it.|Kylo Ren recounts to Rey the night he had nearly been murdered by his own uncle, Luke Skywalker.|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}
[[File:Wakey wakey Ben.png|thumb|left|258x258px|Solo's life changed forever the night he awoke to see Skywalker standing above him, his lightsaber drawn.]]
Skywalker eventually became aware of the darkness which threatened his nephew's soul. He felt a dark movement in the Force, which eventually brought him to his nephew's bedroom one evening. Standing over his sleeping student, Skywalker reached out and sensed an evil, corrupting influence within Ben. The immediacy and severity of the threat caused the Jedi Master to instinctively draw [[Luke Skywalker's green lightsaber|his lightsaber]], intending even for a brief moment to kill his apprentice, though the desire to kill his nephew vanished in an instant, and Skywalker was immediately filled with shame. Ben awoke to see his uncle standing over him with his lightsaber raised, unaware of the brevity of Skywalker's instinct. He panicked, and drew [[Ben Solo's lightsaber|his own saber]] at the sight of the attempt on his life. Believing Skywalker had failed him, Ben met the blade in a quick parry and, through an impressive display of the Force, pulled the entirety of the building onto his former master.<ref name="Episode VIII">[[Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VIII ''The Last Jedi'']]</ref>

With Skywalker incapacitated, Ben proceeded to [[Destruction of Luke Skywalker's Jedi Temple|tear down]] everything that Skywalker had created, massacring the remaining students and leaving the [[Luke Skywalker's Jedi Temple|Jedi Temple]] in ruins and leaving deep traumatic mental scars on Skywalker himself. The fledgling dark warrior then departed the planet with a select group of his fellow students, reorganizing them into a new order of dark side practitioners known as the [[Knights of Ren]]. Believing that Skywalker has perished in the destruction of the Temple,<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Ben took the name "Kylo Ren," becoming an apprentice of Supreme Leader Snoke and [[Master of the Knights of Ren|Master]] of the Knights of Ren.<ref name="Episode VII" /> He was trained by the Supreme Leader, and that training helped make Ben nothing more than a distant memory in the life of Kylo Ren. In time, he was the most gifted apprentice of the Supreme Leader and the embodiment of a new generation of dark side warriors that emerged to fill the void left by the fall of the [[Sith]],<ref name="TFA VD" /> which became extinct with the deaths of Ren's grandfather and his [[Sith Master]] Darth Sidious aboard the [[Death Star II]] during the Battle of Endor.<ref name="TLJ VD">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> Unbeknownst to Ren, Skywalker survived the tragedy, but he was forever changed upon witnessing the death and destruction of his Jedi Order.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

====The rise of Kylo Ren====
{{Quote|Kylo Ren. ''[&hellip;]'' That's what his army called him. He was dressed in black, carried a ''"laser sword"'' like in the old Jedi stories.|Eila, on Kylo Ren|The Children from Tehar}}
[[File:Jedi massacre TLJ.png|thumb|right|259x259px|Solo destroyed the temple and left his uncle for dead, taking several students with him and killing the rest.]]
Ren's betrayal sent shockwaves through his family. With his Jedi destroyed, Skywalker vanished into exile. Those closest to him believed that he went in search of the [[first Jedi Temple]],<ref name="Episode VII" /> which he eventually discovered<ref name="TFA junior novel">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: A Junior Novel]]''</ref> on the [[planet]] [[Ahch-To]].<ref name="Rey's Story">''[[The Force Awakens: Rey's Story]]''</ref> Organa and Solo separated, with Solo returning to smuggling with his best friend and first mate, the [[Wookiee]] warrior [[Chewbacca]]. Organa returned to a life of war,<ref name="Episode VII" /> forming a band of [[soldier]]s known as the [[Resistance]] when the [[New Republic Senate]] refused to take the emerging threat of the First Order seriously.<ref name="TFA VD" /> Though Solo believed there was too much of Darth Vader in Ben and that they lost their son forever, Organa never gave up hope that there was still good in him.<ref name="Episode VII" />

By decree of the Supreme Leader, Ren's true name could never be spoken. Ren sought to put his past behind him, become immune to the temptations of the light, and claim his birthright by ruling the weaker beings of the galaxy. He typically wore a [[Kylo Ren's helmet|combat helmet]], patterned after the battle gear of the Knights of Ren, in order to conceal his identity and give him a more intimidating presence. This helmet also contained a vocal modifier, which lowered the pitch of Ren's voice considerably. Ren's actions as a Jedi earned him the nickname "Jedi Killer," a name whispered amongst the First Order ranks who knew Ren had prevented the return of the Jedi Order.<ref name="TFA VD" /> No longer a Jedi but neither a Sith, Ren strove to harness the pain of his emotional conflict in order to fuel his extraordinary powers and destroy the last traces of the Jedi tradition.<ref name="Kylo Ren Bio Gallery">{{Databank|kylo-ren-biography-gallery|Kylo Ren Biography Gallery}}</ref>

[[File:Knights of Ren.png|thumb|left|246x246px|The former Ben Solo adopted the persona of Kylo Ren, Master of the Knights of Ren and apprentice to Supreme Leader Snoke.]]
Ren's desire to put the light side behind him was a key part of how he viewed his heritage. He came to idolize Darth Vader and kept his grandfather's [[Vader's armor|burned helmet]] as a shrine to the legacy of the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]],<ref name="Episode VII" /> hoping to destroy the last Jedi as Vader had once intended and stamp put the last remnants of the light side of the Force. Though Skywalker had redeemed Vader during the Battle of Endor&mdash;allowing his father, Anakin to fulfill the ancient prophecy of the [[Chosen One]]&mdash;Ren and Snoke both believed that Darth Vader was Anakin's true self and that his redemption had simply been a single yet fatal error in an otherwise important life.<ref name="TFA novel">[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)|''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' novelization]]</ref> Interestingly, Ren had either been contacted at some point by Anakin or believed that he had, as he once beseeched of Vader's helmet to "show [him] ''again'', the power of the darkness."<ref name="Episode VII" />

At some point, Ren built his own [[Kylo Ren's lightsaber|custom lightsaber]]. The crude [[Crossguard lightsaber|design]] was an ancient one, dating back thousands of years<ref name="TFA VD" /> to a [[Great Scourge of Malachor|battle]] between the Jedi and Sith on the planet<ref name="Twilight of the Apprentice">{{Rebels|Twilight of the Apprentice}}</ref> [[Malachor]]. It was built with a cracked [[kyber crystal]], one that could barely contain the weapon's power. As a result of the broken crystal, the lightsaber required vents on either side to divert the excess heat, necessitating its crossguard design. It also gave the [[Color|red]] blade an unstable and [[Fire|fiery]], flickering appearance.<ref name="TFA VD" />

[[File:Phasma Hux Ren.png|thumb|right|246x246px|Kylo Ren and General Armitage Hux, each representing a different side of the First Order, vied for the attention of the Supreme Leader.]]
As an apprentice to Supreme Leader Snoke and an enforcer of Snoke's will (much like his grandfather had been to [[Darth Sidious|Emperor Palpatine]] during the reign of the Galactic Empire), Ren became an influential member of the First Order's power structure. Though he had direct access to the Supreme Leader and could command [[First Order military|military]] officers, he existed outside of the official military command structure. This led to some tension with the First Order's upper ranks, who contended with him despite being wary that his agenda trumped military objectives. This arrangement deliberately mirrored the Galactic Empire's relationship with Darth Vader, who existed outside of the formal military hierarchy but could nonetheless command the [[Imperial Military]] in his own objectives. This tension was particularly palpable with General [[Armitage Hux]], the commander of [[Starkiller Base]], the First Order [[superweapon]] capable of destroying entire [[star system]]s. Ren, who was part of an unofficial Starkiller Base command triumvirate with Hux and [[Captain]] [[Phasma]] of the First Order military, had little regard for Hux as a warrior; Hux's military experience was mostly theoretical and based on simulated but nonetheless respected battlefield scenarios. Hux, likewise, was a man of science and had little understanding of Ren's mystical ways. Both vied for the attention of the Supreme Leader.<ref name="TFA VD" />

Over time Ren's reputation came to rival that of Hux and Phasma, both of whom were noted among the First Order ranks for their power and influence. Nevertheless, soldiers such as Captain [[Cardinal]] held Ren in high regard, believing he would be the one to lead the First Order to victory.<ref name="Phasma">''[[Phasma (novel)|Phasma]]''</ref> However, although he was highly regarded by some figures of the First Order command, others were less impressed with the young Knight of Ren. [[Agent]] [[Terex]], an officer of the First Order's [[First Order Security Bureau|security branch]], was disdainfully dismissive of the dark side warrior's attempt to emulate Darth Vader, whom he had met and considered a truly terrifying figure.<ref name="Poe Dameron 11">''[[Poe Dameron 11: The Gathering Storm, Part IV]]''</ref>

====Colonization of the Unknown Regions====
{{Quote|They also said that someone called ''Kylo Ren'' was leading the First Order army. Does that name mean anything to you?''"<br />"''You could say that. General Organa will want to hear about this immediately.|[[Kazuda Xiono]] and [[Ello Asty]]|The Children from Tehar}}
As one of the commanders of the First Order's military, Ren was heavily involved in its campaign to colonize the Unknown Regions, where the former Imperials had been rebuilding their strength since the Battle of Jakku.<ref name="TFA VD" /> Aided by mysterious alien navigators known as the [[Attendants]], the First Order had been able to navigate beyond the frontier of the known galaxy, allowing them to survive and rebuild their power.<ref name="TLJ VD" /> Several threats lurked in the Unknown Regions, hermetic kingdoms who were confronted by the growing new power. On Supreme Leader Snoke's instruction, the new military undertook a major offensive against several of these kingdoms to seize their worlds and resources to fuel their rise.<ref name="Expanded Edition" />

In [[34 ABY]], Ren led a small army to the world of [[Tehar]], where they subjugated the local population by [[Massacre on Tehar|massacring]] a village. However, two children, [[Kel]] and [[Eila]], survived the destruction of their village and fled Tehar after stowing away on a cargo ship. Since the children bore the knowledge of its aggressive actions against the people on Tehar, the First Order [[Hunt for Eila and Kel|placed]] a large bounty of twenty thousand credits on their heads, telling informants that Kel and Eila were members of a high-ranking First Order family from outside its military hierarchy.<ref name="The Children from Tehar">{{Resistance|The Children from Tehar}}</ref>

===The search for Skywalker===
{{Quote|If Skywalker returns, the new Jedi will rise.|Supreme Leader Snoke to Kylo Ren, expressing his concerns about Skywalker's return.|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}
Both Ren and the Supreme Leader understood that if Skywalker and the Jedi were to ever return, they would be a grave threat to the future of the First Order. The people who were closest to Skywalker believed he had gone in search of the first Jedi temple, the location of which had been lost. A partial map was recovered from the archives of the Galactic Empire, but it was missing a key piece of the puzzle. The First Order soon discovered that the missing map fragment was in the possession of [[Lor San Tekka]],<ref name="Episode VII" /> a member of the [[Church of the Force]]<ref name="TFA VD" /> on [[Jakku]] who believed that the return of the Jedi was essential for bringing balance to the Force. Ren, who knew San Tekka from childhood as the explorer was once an old ally of Organa and Skywalker, brought the [[Resurgent-class Star Destroyer|''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Finalizer]]'' in his search for the map.<ref name="Episode VII" />

====Mission to Pillio====
{{Quote|Tell me where Lor San Tekka took the map.''"<br />"''&hellip;Bayora. He took it to Bayora.|Kylo Ren and Del Meeko|Star Wars Battlefront II}}
[[File:MissionPillioKylo.png|thumb|left|249x249px|Ren ordered Gleb to bring him to Del Meeko so that he could begin the prisoner's interrogation regarding Lor San Tekka and the map to Skywalker.]]
The hunt for Skywalker caused Ren to undertake a [[Mission to Pillio|journey]] the planet [[Pillio]]. Although San Tekka was not found on the world, the First Order's allies captured and detained [[Del Meeko]], a veteran of the Galactic Civil War who served the Empire and New Republic, in turn, as a member of [[Inferno Squad]]. Upon his arrival, the dark warrior was greeted by [[Protectorate (title)|Protectorate]] [[Gleb]] of [[Jinata Security]]. Dismissive of the formalities, he instructed the [[Aqualish]] [[officer]] to lead him to Meeko. He found the former soldier wounded and alone on the [[Bridge (starship)|bridge]] of the [[Raider II-class corvette|''Raider II''-class corvette]] ''[[Corvus]]''.<ref name="Battlefront II">''[[Star Wars Battlefront II]]''</ref>

Ignoring the prisoner's sarcasm, Ren used the Force to [[Mind probe (Force power)|probe]] through Meeko's [[Brain|mind]], determined to learn where San Tekka took the map. For all of Meeko's efforts to resist the probe, invading his mind was a relatively simple task for Ren, who saw memories ranging across the former [[commando]]'s life&mdash;from his service on [[Scarif]] as a [[coastal defender stormtrooper]] to his participation in the Battle of Endor and the [[Skirmish on Vardos|skirmish]] on [[Vardos]]. He also learned that Meeko encountered Skywalker on Pillio and subsequently discovered his faith in the Force. Ultimately, Meeko was unable to resist Ren's powers and revealed that San Tekka took the map with him to [[Bayora]].<ref name="Battlefront II" />

Having gained the information he sought, Ren turned the prisoner over to [[First Order officer]] [[Gideon Hask]], one of Meeko's former teammates in the Inferno Squad prior the Empire's fall, who executed Meeko shortly thereafter.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

====GUHL-JO387O====
{{Quote|General Hux&hellip; I know where we must go&hellip; and I know this is the key. We are so close.|Kylo Ren, to Armitage Hux|Pest Control}}
[[File:High Command - Adventures 3-.JPG|thumb|right|206x206px|Ren and Hux worked together during the First Order's hunt for Skywalker.]]
Later, Ren, Hux and two First Order [[admiral]]s gathered in a conference room aboard the ''Finalizer'' over the planet [[GUHL-JO387O]]. They were discussing travel to a planet in the [[Western Reaches]]. While in the conference, [[Unidentified creature (GUHL-JO387O)|the creature]] that [[Finn|FN-2187]] was chasing turned off the lights, interrupting the conference.<ref name="Pest Control">{{IDWAdventuresCite|3|[[Pest Control]]}}</ref>

After the conference, Ren told Phasma to take a [[squad]] of trainees to investigate the planet for any Resistance activity.<ref name="Pest Control" />

====Raid on Jakku====
{{Quote|The map to Skywalker. We know you've found it, and now you're going to give it to the First Order.''"<br />"''The First Order rose from the dark side. You did not.''"<br />"''I'll show you the dark side.''"<br />"''You may try, but you cannot deny the truth that is your family.''"<br />"''You're so right.|Kylo Ren and Lor San Tekka, moments before the latter's death|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}
[[File:Lor San Tekka brought before Kylo Ren.png|thumb|left|248x248px|Ren demanded that San Tekka give him the map to Skywalker, but the old explorer refused&mdash;and paid for it with his life.]]
Ren’s search later brought him to Jakku, where its military [[Attack on Tuanul|attacked]] the village of [[Tuanul]], where San Tekka lived. Once the [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|First Order stormtroopers]], under the command of Phasma, rounded up the denizens of the village, Ren arrived on the battlefield and confronted San Tekka, lamenting how old the former explorer had become, to which San Tekka replied that Ren's fall to the dark side was far worse. Ren demanded that San Tekka give the map to the First Order, but San Tekka refused to submit to the will of the dark side and reminded the one-time Jedi that Ren could not deny the truth of his heritage, at which point Ren struck him down with his lightsaber while sarcastically agreeing with him.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Moments later, he was shot at from afar by [[Commander]] [[Poe Dameron]], a [[Resistance Starfighter Corps|starfighter]] pilot in the Resistance who was sent to Jakku by General Organa to find the map before the First Order. Ren used the Force to [[Force Stasis|freeze]] the [[blaster]] bolt midair, and Dameron was soon brought before him. The dark warrior realized that Tekka gave the map to Dameron and ordered that the [[trooper]]s bring the pilot onto Ren's [[Kylo Ren's command shuttle|command shuttle]], before giving the order to kill the rest of the villagers. One stormtrooper, FN-2187, hesitated and ultimately chose not to fire on the civilians, an act that Ren noticed as he could sense his fear before boarding his shuttle.<ref name="Episode VII" />

====Locating BB-8====
{{Quote|The droid&hellip; stole a freighter?|Kylo Ren, to Dopheld Mitaka|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}
[[File:Kylo tortures Poe Dameron.png|thumb|right|269x269px|Ren used the Force to extract the location of the map from Poe Dameron's mind.]]
Dameron was [[Prison|brought]] aboard the ''Finalizer'' for interrogation, where he was placed into an [[Torture|interrogation]] [[Interrogation chair|chair]].<ref name="Episode VII" /> The device, used by the dark warrior to extract information from his prisoners, was based on similar devices once used by the [[Inquisitorius|Inquisitors]] of the Galactic Empire.<ref name="TFA VD" /> First Order interrogators were unable to break Dameron, but they did learn that he was the best pilot in the Resistance, a feat that Ren noted once he began interrogating the pilot personally. Though the dark knight was impressed that Dameron had not yet been broken, Ren began to use the Force to mentally extract the information from Dameron's mind. The pilot, who resisted the Force attack, finally was forced to reveal that he had hidden the map inside his [[BB-series|BB unit]], [[BB-8]], who was likely still on Jakku. Ren informed General Hux of the new development and left the recovery of the droid in the hands of the military.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Shortly after leaving Dameron under the guard of several stormtroopers, Ren arrived on the ''Finalizer''{{'}}s bridge upon hearing that the Resistance pilot [[Escape from the Finalizer|escaped]] aboard a [[TIE/fo space superiority fighter|TIE fighter]]. Hux confirmed this with the additional information of Dameron having had help from someone within the First Order's ranks. Ren realized that it could only have been FN-2187 after remembering how the conflicted soldier had hesitated in Tuanul, and he said as much to Hux. The TIE fighter was eventually shot down after a brief skirmish, and it crash-landed on Jakku.<ref name="Episode VII" />

The First Order recognized that Dameron and FN-2187 were looking for the droid, so Hux ordered a [[squadron]] to be sent to Jakku to recover it first. Hux soon spoke to the Supreme Leader, who ordered them to capture the droid if they could, but destroy it if they must. Ren questioned the capability of Hux's soldiers and training methods, wondering aloud whether the Supreme Leader would be better off using an army of [[Cloning|clones]]<ref name="Episode VII" /> as the [[Galactic Republic]]<ref name="Episode II">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]</ref> and the early Empire had once done.<ref name="Episode III">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref> Hux told him that they were more than capable, and warned Ren not to let his personal mission to find Skywalker interfere with the Supreme Leader's orders.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Later that day,<ref name="Episode VII" /> a nervous [[Lieutenant]] [[Dopheld Mitaka]]<ref name="TFA VD" /> informed Ren that the [[astromech droid]] escaped aboard a [[YT-1300 light freighter]]. At first, Ren found it unlikely for a single droid to be capable of stealing a ship but allowed Mitaka to continue. Further intelligence suggested the probability of FN-2187 abetting the droid's evacuation from Jakku. Enraged that the traitor had robbed him of the means to find Skywalker, Ren ignited his lightsaber and destroyed the [[computer]] terminal in front of him. The dark warrior calmed down, asking if there was "anything else." Mitaka replied that FN-2187 and the droid had help from a [[Rey|girl]]. Ren used the Force to drag Mitaka towards him, grabbed him by the neck, and demanded to know who the girl was.<ref name="Episode VII" />

===Return of the past===
{{Quote|The droid we seek is aboard the ''Millennium Falcon''. In the hands of your father, Han Solo.''"<br />"''He means nothing to me.''"<br />"''Even ''you'', Master of the Knights of Ren, have never faced such a test.''"<br />"''By the grace of your training, I will not be seduced.''"<br />"''We shall see. We shall see.|Kylo Ren and Supreme Leader Snoke|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}
[[File:Kylo Ren and Snoke.png|thumb|left|270x270px|The Supreme Leader told Ren that BB-8 was in the hands of Han Solo and warned the dark warrior he was about to face his greatest test.]]
With BB-8 gone, the ''Finalizer'' made its way to Starkiller Base. Once there, Ren and Hux spoke to Supreme Leader Snoke, who communicated to his subordinates via an enlarged [[hologram]]. Snoke remained concerned that Skywalker's return would be a threat to the First Order, so Hux proposed that they finally use the weapon as intended and destroy the New Republic one and for all. Without the Republic, Hux knew that the Resistance would be vulnerable and could be stopped before they found Skywalker. The Supreme Leader gave the general his permission and Hux left to oversee preparations, while Ren remained behind.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Both Snoke and Ren could sense that the Force was awakening<ref name="Episode VII" /> from dormancy once again,<ref name="TFA VD" /> and the Supreme Leader told his apprentice that BB-8 was in the hands of Han Solo; the old smuggler had the droid aboard his ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. Ren claimed Solo meant nothing to him and that he would not be "seduced" by the light<ref name="Episode VII" /> as his grandfather once was,<ref name="TFA novel" /> not while he had Snoke's training. Even so, the Supreme Leader warned that this would be Ren's greatest test.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Though Ren claimed he would not be seduced, he nonetheless felt the pull of the light side.<ref name="Episode VII" /> In his personal quarters aboard the ''Finalizer'',<ref name="TFA VD" /> Ren spoke to the helmet of Darth Vader, searching for guidance and hoping that the legacy of the Dark Lord could remind him of the power of the dark side. He swore that if Vader could somehow show him that dark power, then Ren would finish what the Sith started and destroy the last of the Jedi.<ref name="Episode VII" />

====Capture of Rey====
{{Quote|You still want to kill me.''"<br />"''That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask.|Kylo Ren and Rey|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}
[[File:Destruction of Hosnian System.png|thumb|right|260x260px|Ren witnessed the power that Starkiller Base unleashed upon the Hosnian system, destroying the New Republic and sending billions to their deaths.]]
The First Order soon learned that Solo, the girl, FN-2187, and BB-8 had landed on [[Takodana]] and were in the [[Maz Kanata's castle|castle]] of the ancient [[pirate]] [[Maz Kanata]], who Solo hoped would help deliver the droid to the Resistance. Before the First Order departed, General Hux unleashed the Starkiller weapon against the Republic. After giving a speech to his forces about the end of a regime that he believed could not contain galactic chaos, Hux ordered that the weapon be fired. Ren watched from the bridge of the ''Finalizer''<ref name="Episode VII" /> as the weapon's [[phantom energy]]<ref name="TFA novel" /> left the surface of Starkiller Base and made their way<ref name="Episode VII" /> to the Republic's [[capital]] of [[Hosnian Prime]],<ref name="TFA VD" /> where they [[Hosnian Cataclysm|destroyed]] the entire [[Hosnian system]].<ref name="Episode VII" />

[[File:ReyRen-TFAintltrailer.png|thumb|left|250x250px|Ren discovered Rey on Takodana and took her prisoner once he realized she had seen the map to Skywalker.]]
With the Republic severely damaged, Ren led his forces to Takodana, where the stormtroopers [[Battle of Takodana|attacked]] Kanata's castle. Solo, FN-2187, and BB-8 were briefly captured by the First Order before Dameron and the Resistance Starfighter Corps arrived to recover the droid, while the girl and BB-8 tried to escape through the forest. The two split up, as the girl led stormtroopers away from the droid. Ren soon arrived on the battlefield and found the girl in the woods. She fired at him with [[Rey's NN-14 blaster pistol|her blaster]], but he followed her and deflected the shots with his lightsaber. Finally, Ren froze her in place with a [[Telekinesis|telekinetic]] attack.<ref name="Episode VII" />

He peered into the girl's mind, learning of her life as a [[scavenger]] in the [[Starship Graveyard (Jakku)|junkyards]] of Jakku. Going further, he saw that Rey had seen the map. The First Order wouldn't be needing BB-8, he believed, and so he placed the girl in an unconscious state with the Force and carried her to his command shuttle. He ordered the First Order to retreat, as they had what they came for, and their forces left Takodana. BB-8 ultimately made it out of the forests and into the hands of the Resistance.<ref name="Episode VII" />

[[File:MindProbe-TFA.png|thumb|right|269x269px|Ren probed Rey's mind for the map to Skywalker and sensed her loneliness in the process.]]
Ren brought the girl to Starkiller Base, restraining her in an interrogation chair. When she awoke, she asked where her friends were, and Ren told her he had no idea. He sensed she still wanted to kill him, and Rey said it was because she was being hunted by a creature in a mask. The dark warrior removed his mask to show his [[human]] face and asked about the droid, but the girl only gave him BB-8's technical specifications. Ren told her that he knew about the map and that the First Order had recovered the rest of it from the archives of the Empire.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Knowing the girl was resilient, Ren warned her that he could take whatever he wanted from her mind. He touched her face and began probing her mind with the Force.<ref name="Episode VII" /> At first, he got a hold of the her name: Rey.<ref name="TFA novel" /> Next, he could feel loneliness and fear within her, followed by the sight of an [[ocean]] and an island. Then he sensed Han Solo. Ren could tell that Rey looked at the smuggler as a father figure, but he said that Solo would have only disappointed her. Finally, Rey began to become more strongly resistant to his mental attacks. She soon turned the mental probing around on him, using the Force within herself to see that Ren himself was afraid&mdash;afraid that he would never be as strong as Darth Vader was.<ref name="Episode VII" />

====Snoke's new strategy====
{{Quote|If what you say about this girl is true, bring her to me.|Snoke|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}
[[File:Snoke speaks to Kylo Ren and Hux.png|thumb|left|243x243px|Snoke ordered Hux to target the Starkiller at the Resistance, and told Ren to bring Rey before him.]]
Stunned by the reversal, Ren left Rey behind in the interrogation chamber and spoke to the Supreme Leader, who reacted with incredulity that a mere scavenger resisted him. Ren told Snoke that Rey was strong with the Force, stronger than she even knew. The Supreme Leader asked what happened to the droid, and General Hux, who had just entered the chamber, told Snoke that Ren believed he only needed Rey and allowed the droid to escape. Concerned that the Resistance might have the full map to Skywalker, Snoke ordered Hux to unleash the Starkiller weapon against the [[Resistance base]] on the planet [[D'Qar]]. Ren swore that he could still find the map in Rey’s mind as long as he had his master’s guidance, so the Supreme Leader ordered Rey to be brought to him.<ref name="Episode VII" />

On his way to the holding cell where Rey was being held, Ren learned that the girl had somehow broken out. The guard who had been ordered to watch her could not fathom how he ended up in his quarters. When asked by a First Order officer if "stronger methods" were needed, Ren declined; any further simple questioning might enable the guard to remember something important. In the meantime, Rey must be found.<ref name="TFA novel" />

When Ren returned to the cell,<ref name="Episode VII" /> he needed to see if Rey had truly used her emerging Force abilities to escape. Inspection revealed the interrogation bench was deserted, every one of its restraints left open as if to mock Ren.<ref name="TFA novel" /> Enraged, he ignited his lightsaber and destroyed the room, causing two passing stormtroopers to quickly back away.<ref name="Episode VII" />

====Han Solo's last stand====
{{Quote|Your son is gone. He was weak and foolish, like his father. So I destroyed him.''"<br />"''That's what Snoke wants you to believe but it's not true. My son is alive.''"<br />"''No. The Supreme Leader is wise.|Kylo Ren and Han Solo|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}
[[File:Han and Leia hug TFA.png|thumb|right|253x253px|Despite Ren's actions, his parents missed him and longed for the return of the boy they named Ben Solo.]]
Ren commanded the First Order troops to be on alert for Rey as she began making her way through the base, as he knew that the longer she was able to tap into her powers while escaping, the more powerful she would become. A [[Unidentified female First Order stormtrooper|trooper]] reported sensor readings in [[Hangar 718]], which meant Rey could be there. But investigations turned up nothing. Nonetheless, Ren wanted every hangar on lockdown to prevent Rey from commandeering a ship. Right in the middle of that order, he was interrupted by a familiar presence: Han Solo. His father was on Starkiller Base.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Ren ordered for a search of the ''Millennium Falcon'', for the ship had shortly been sighted at the edge of a cliff. By the time he arrived on the scene, everything checked clear and not a single hidden trap could be found. He boarded the ''Falcon'' and sat on the pilot's seat, looking for anything that may lead him to Solo's whereabouts. Just then, he spotted Resistance [[T-70 X-wing starfighter|X-wings]] flying past and [[Battle of Starkiller Base|assaulting]] the [[thermal oscillator]],<ref name="TFA novel" /> hoping to destroy it and set off a chain reaction that would cause the planet to implode before the weapon could destroy D'Qar. Ren rushed to the oscillator, commanding his troops to find the intruders.<ref name="Episode VII" /> He knew Solo had to be nearby,<ref name="TFA novel" /> as well as the fact that he did not come alone.<ref name="Episode VII" />

As Ren advanced on the walkway, he stopped upon hearing the voice of his father, calling out to him from behind, using his birth name. He turned about face and said he had been waiting for this eventuality. Solo told him to remove the mask so he could see the face of his son once more. Ren removed the mask but told Solo that he had destroyed Ben, who Ren thought was weak and foolish like his father was. Solo refused to believe that; he said his son was alive and that Snoke was simply using Ren for his power, and that once Snoke had gotten what he wanted from Ren, he'd "crush" him. Ren, while neither denying nor confirming what Solo said about Snoke to be true, stated that it was too late for him. Solo pleaded with Ren to come home, saying that he and Organa missed having their boy with them. Ren, conflicted by the pull towards the light, broke down in tears and told his father that he was being torn apart by the constant struggle between the dark and the light inside him and wanted to be free of the pain that he was feeling. He knew what he had to do to end the pain, but he did not know if he had the strength to do it. So he asked for his father's help, and Solo agreed, not knowing that it was the light that Ren felt conflicted by.<ref name="Episode VII" />

[[File:Kylo impales Solo.png|thumb|left|264x264px|Ren committed patricide, believing it would end his conflict, but his father's death only served to unbalance the dark side warrior.]]
Ren, who was being watched from afar by Chewbacca, Rey, and FN-2187, took out his lightsaber and Solo grabbed hold of it. As the Starkiller finished draining the [[star]] it orbited to power the weapon, and the light on the planet died out, Ren ignited his lightsaber and impaled his father through the torso. A mortally wounded Han Solo touched his son's face one last time before falling to his death in the bowels of the oscillator.<ref name="Episode VII" />

The act of killing his father had an unsettling effect on Ren. Rather than make him stronger in the dark side, as he had thought, it had weakened his spirit.<ref name="TFA novel" /> He was rendered unbalanced.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> The shock had been so profound, he did not register Chewbacca's roar of anguish,<ref name="TFA novel" /> nor Rey's scream of horror.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Enraged by the loss of his best friend, Chewbacca fired a powerful shot from his Wookiee [[bowcaster]] and hit Ren in the left side, seriously injuring the dark knight.<ref name="Episode VII" /> Quickly, Ren used the Force to reduce the effects of the wound, lest it may result in his premature death.<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> Chewbacca killed several other stormtroopers in the area as Rey and FN-2187, who were high above in the oscillator, began firing into the area as well. The Wookiee then ignited charges that he and Solo set throughout the oscillator, causing a massive explosion that breached the oscillator and gave Dameron and the remaining Resistance pilots an opportunity to destroy it. As Ren composed himself from his injury, he made [[eye]] contact with FN-2187 and Rey. Anger swelling within him, he was resolved to find them before they could escape.<ref name="Episode VII" />

====Duel in the forest====
{{Quote|We're not done yet.''"<br />"''You're a monster!''"<br />"''It's just us now. Han Solo can't save you.|Kylo Ren and Rey|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}
[[File:Kylo Ren duels Finn.png|thumb|right|271x271px|The former FN-2187 stood his ground against Ren, but was no match against the dark side warrior's skill with the lightsaber.]]
Ren followed Rey and FN-2187 into the forests outside of the oscillator, as they made their way back to the nearby ''Millennium Falcon''. He confronted them, lightsaber drawn, and said that they still had unfinished business which Han Solo could not save them from. Outraged by Ren's patricidal actions, Rey denounced the dark warrior as a monster and tried to attack him with her blaster, but he used the Force to throw her into a tree and knock her unconscious. Now it was just Ren and the traitor who had earned his ire.<ref name="Episode VII" />

FN-2187 ignited the [[Skywalker's lightsaber|lightsaber]] that had been given to him for safekeeping by Maz Kanata&mdash;a lightsaber that once belonged to Luke Skywalker, and to Anakin before him. Ren demanded that FN-2187 give him the lightsaber, claiming it belonged to him, but instead FN-2187 engaged him in a lightsaber duel. It was a short but brutal contest, in which Ren kept striking his bowcaster injury in order to fuel his anger and power. In the end, FN-2187, who nonetheless landed one blow on Ren's right shoulder, was no match for Ren's power. Ren overwhelmed and disarmed his opponent, ending the fight with a punch and a lightsaber blow across FN-2187's back that left the one-time stormtrooper comatose.<ref name="Episode VII" />

With the duel seemingly over, Ren turned his attention towards his grandfather's lightsaber and attempted to use the Force to [[Force pull|draw]] it into his hand. Instead, it flew past him and landed in the hands of Rey, who used the Force to call it to her&mdash;as it was her destiny to wield the lightsaber of Anakin Skywalker. Rey ignited the weapon and engaged Ren in a tense duel. At first, Ren had the upper hand, remaining on the offensive as he pressed his attack against the retreating scavenger. Their blades became locked, and Ren told the emerging Force-sensitive that she needed a teacher. It was he, Ren said, who could show her the ways of the Force. At that moment, Rey realized she could call upon the powers of the Force and began using that to her advantage. She turned the tide of the fight and pushed her own offensive against the dark warrior, who she was finally able to disarm. In doing so, she slashed her blade across his face, knocking him down and disfiguring him in the process.<ref name="Episode VII" />

[[File:Rey vs Kylo Ren.png|thumb|left|245x245px|Though Ren initially had the upper hand, Rey defeated him by embracing the powers of the Force.]]
Before they could engage any further, the surface of the planet began to break apart&mdash;the Resistance was victorious, and the destruction of the oscillator triggered the Starkiller's implosion. Ren and Rey were separated by a deep chasm, so Rey left the dark warrior behind, recovered FN-2187, and fled the planet with Chewbacca aboard the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name="Episode VII" />

As the planet continued to collapse, Snoke ordered General Hux to find Ren and bring the young knight before the Supreme Leader so the young warrior training could be completed.<ref name="Episode VII" /> Hux and several troopers tracked Ren's signal and took him aboard a shuttle, leaving before the planet exploded.<ref name="TFA junior novel" /> Immediately Starkiller Base's destruction, Ren received treatment for the long scars on his body, though it was too late to erase them completely.<ref name="TLJ VD" />

===Let the past die===
{{Quote|Alas, you're no Vader. You're just a child in a mask.|Snoke, to Kylo Ren|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}
[[File:Supreme Leader Kylo Ren.png|thumb|right|250x250px|Ren sustained physical wounds in addition to hidden emotional ones that left him more conflicted than ever.]]
Following the Resistance's [[Evacuation of D'Qar|evacuation]] of the base on D'Qar, Ren was summoned to Supreme Leader Snoke's [[Snoke's throne room|throne room]], located in the [[Mega-class Star Dreadnought|''Mega''-class Star Dreadnought]] ''[[Supremacy]]''.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> The blows inflicted on him by Rey and Chewbacca were still as fresh as ever, causing him some discomfort,<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> though he tried to hide this. Kneeling before his master, he listened as Snoke loudly recalled the raw, untamed power that Ren possessed, abilities which had originally brought him to the dark sider's attention. Knowing the potential of the powerful Skywalker bloodline, the Supreme Leader revealed his belief that Ren could fulfill his grandfather's dark legacy.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

[[File:I gave everything I have to you.png|thumb|left|250x250px|Ren's failure cost him the respect of his Master, who derided him as a sentimental child hiding in a mask.]]
But in light of his apprentice's most recent setback, Snoke retracted his faith in Ren's power.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> He chastised the dark warrior, calling him weak and sentimental,<ref name="Kylo Ren DB" /> just like his late father.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> The struggle within Ren as he prepared to strike down Han Solo had been sensed by Snoke from afar.<ref name="Last Jedi 1">''[[The Last Jedi Adaptation 1]]''</ref> It was the trauma from this action that caused him to be outmatched by an untrained scavenger, who had never before wielded a lightsaber. Snoke had never seen such a pathetic display.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

Fury building within him, Ren rose to meet his master, but Snoke quickly suppressed the attack with a surge of [[Force lightning|lightning]], throwing the apprentice back. As long as Luke Skywalker lived, Snoke seethed&mdash;as long as the Jedi remained&mdash;so did hope across the galaxy. Ren would never be able to destroy it because he was a mere child hiding in a mask; nothing like the feared Darth Vader. Leaving the throne room, Ren erupted in a rage of self-pity and smashed his helmet against the surrounding metal. He then ordered his ship to be readied, resuming his quest to eradicate the Resistance.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

====Chasing the Resistance====
{{Quote|Follow my lead.|Kylo Ren, to his wingmen|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}
[[File:TIE attack on the Resistance fleet.png|thumb|right|267x267px|Ren led the attack on the Resistance flagship, but was unable to open fire on his mother.]]
As Hux had anticipated through new tracking technology, the First Order armada emerged out of hyperspace to find the Resistance fleet unprepared and defenseless. The warship ''Supremacy'' led the charge, its powerful [[turbolaser]]s showering the fleet with unyielding blasts. To complement the [[Attack on the Resistance fleet|barrage]], the ''Supremacy'' scrambled its short-distance fighters, with Ren spearheading the assault in his personal [[TIE/vn space superiority fighter|TIE Silencer]]. Covered by three wingmen, until the third pilot was quickly destroyed, the dark apprentice intercepted the Resistance's [[MC85 Star Cruiser]] ''[[Raddus (MC85 Star Cruiser)|Raddus]]'', capital ship of the fleet. Before the rebel pilots could launch a counterattack, he destroyed the ''Raddus'' hangar, leaving them unable to resist the fighter wing.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

With the Resistance flagship crippled, Ren turned his fighter to face the bridge of the craft, readying his rockets. At this moment he sensed his mother's presence aboard the ''Raddus'' (with his mother likewise sensing him too) and Ren, hesitating, held his thumb over the trigger in a moment of intense doubt. After a moment, he surrendered to his second thoughts and abandoned the trigger control. His [[Poldin LeHuse|wingmen]], however, had no such qualms&mdash;ever loyal to the First Order, they launched their rockets in Ren's place upon the bridge.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

Ren watched the detonation with astonishment.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> He reached out again, but could not feel Organa anywhere. He believed that if he had had enough time, if he had not been taken by surprise, he would have protected his mother with the Force. Now, however, he had to conclude that she had died, along with all those present on the ''Raddus''{{'}} bridge.<ref name="Expanded Edition" />

Following this last offensive, Hux ordered the fighters back to the ''Supremacy'', as the Resistance fleet had pulled out of the ''Supremacy''{{'s}} protective radius in the intervening time. Ren, with his wingmen being blown up around him, had no other recourse but to comply.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

====A growing connection====
{{Quote|I'd never felt so alone.''"<br />"''You're not alone.''"<br />"''Neither are you. It isn't too late&hellip;|Rey and Kylo Ren|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}
[[File:Why is the Force connecting us.png|thumb|left|245x245px|With their minds bridged by a powerful Force-bond, Rey came to sense the great turmoil within Ren.]]
As the First Order's pursuit of the Resistance fleet, Ren was being treated for the injury he had taken to his face, a medical droid removing the micro-sutures that had been attached to it, when he sensed a disturbance. Before he knew it, a vision of Rey appeared before him. Taken aback by surprise, Ren could only watch as Rey reached for her blaster and shot him. However, no shot injured him. The still shocked Ren pursued Rey when she ran away and found her soon after and tried to use the Mind Trick to force Rey to bring Luke to him, only to soon realize that they weren't actually in the same location and that Rey had not [[Force projection|projected]] her appearance to him as the effort would also kill her in the process. He even discovered that Rey had found Luke Skywalker and was now studying under him, although he could not discern where as he was unable to see Rey's surroundings.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Whereas the aspiring Jedi regarded their [[Force-bond|connection]] as an inconvenience, Ren was intrigued by his bond with the former scavenger and sought to better understand it.<ref name="Expanded Edition" />

The bond between Ren and Rey was unprecedented in its strength and raw power.<ref name="TLJ VD" /> It also had an effect on Ren's churning emotions<ref name="Kylo Ren Bio Gallery" /> and as it grew stronger in the Force, Rey started gaining new insights into Ren who,<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> to Rey's surprise, no longer tried to hide his feelings of pain and misery from her.<ref name="Rey Bio Gallery">{{Databank|rey-biography-gallery|Rey Biography Gallery}}</ref> It was because of the bond and her new understanding of Ren's pain that Rey came to suspect that their destinies were intertwined.<ref name="Rey">{{Databank|rey|Rey}}</ref> Ren eventually revealed his recollection of the night he forsook Skywalker's teachings&mdash;how he awoke to the sound of a lightsaber, held by his uncle who intended to murder Ben Solo in his sleep&mdash;shaking Rey's faith in her Jedi Master. Although Rey called him a liar,<ref name="Episode VIII" /> she sensed no deception from Ren. He genuinely believed that his former mentor had betrayed him and intended to kill him while he was defenseless.<ref name="Expanded Edition" />

[[File:Luke interrupting Rey and Kylo Ren.png|thumb|right|262x262px|After touching hands, Rey sensed the light in Ren and sought to redeem him despite Skywalker's warning.]]
After failing to discover the fate of her parents, Rey sought out Ren through their bond because he understood what it was like to feel alone and lost.<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> They comforted each other, insisting that neither was alone and in that moment they touched hands. Rey then beheld a vision of the future, leading her to believe that Ren was fated to renounce the dark side and return to the light,<ref name="Episode VIII" /> like his grandfather before him.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

As a result of what she saw, Rey became convinced that her adversary could be turned from the dark side of the Force. She left Skywalker on his sanctuary and traveled to the ''Supremacy'' to see Ren, her actions guided by the belief that Ben Solo could be redeemed with her help. By touching hands, however, Ren experienced a vision of his own and thereby discerned the truth of Rey's father and mother: they were no one, merely a pair of junk traders who sold their daughter for drinking money before ultimately dying and being buried in a pauper's grave in the Jakku desert.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> This discovery convinced Ren that Rey would turn to the dark side and stand with him as they moved to confront his master together.<ref name="Expanded Edition" />

====Destiny fulfilled====
{{Quote|My worthy apprentice, son of darkness, heir apparent to Lord Vader. Where there was conflict I now sense resolve, where there was weakness, strength. Complete your training and fulfill your ''destiny''.|Snoke's final words to Kylo Ren|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}
[[File:Death of the Supreme Leader.png|thumb|left|258x258px|Ren accomplished what his grandfather could not: killing and usurping the dark master as ruler of the galaxy.]]
Ren's emotions were fully open to Rey, who could feel that his conflict had grown worse ever since he killed his father. Clinging to the good she sensed within the dark side warrior, she reached out to the former Ben Solo and revealed her conviction in the vision she had when they touched hands through the Force. Solo was not fated to continue bowing before Snoke. Redemption was his destiny; of that Rey was certain. Ren, however, revealed that he also beheld a vision that convinced him it would be Rey who turned; because he now knew the truth behind Rey's parentage. Just before they entered the throne room where the Supreme Leader awaited their arrival, Rey sensed that much of Ren's churning emotions were about her.<ref name="Expanded Edition" />

Snoke, who proclaimed that his faith in Ren had been restored, began appraising Rey who remained defiant in spite of her inability to resist the dark master's Force powers. Although Rey remained certain that Ren would turn, her mental defenses began to crumble when Snoke revealed that he had been responsible for the intermittent connections she experienced with the Supreme Leader's apprentice, a revelation which came as a shock to Ren as well. It had all been a plot to draw Rey, the means to find Luke Skywalker, right into Snoke's hands. Nevertheless, Ren remained silent as Rey screamed,<ref name="Episode VIII" /> trying in vain to stop Snoke from invading her mind.<ref name="Expanded Edition" />

Upon discovering Skywalker's location, Snoke planned to wipe him out from above as soon as the more immediate enemy had been dealt with. Rey summoned Skywalker's lightsaber to her hand, only for Snoke to redirect the hilt onto her head; Ren, eyes shut, merely tilted his head to the right to avoid being struck by the flying object. The Supreme Leader revealed through his [[Oculus (device)|oculus]] the Resistance being picked off one by one as they tried to flee aboard [[U-55 orbital loadlifter|transports]] for safety. All that Ren's mother had fought for would be destroyed by the ''Supremacy''{{'}}s guns. In response, an enraged Rey pulled Ren's lightsaber into her hands and charged at Snoke, who effortlessly overpowered her. Ren watched the lightsaber fall out of Rey's grip and shut off, sliding on the floor back to its owner's feet.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

Snoke, who had grown weary of his aft-conflicted apprentice, exulted at the newfound resolve that he suddenly felt emanating from Ren. Having promised to kill Rey with the cruelest stroke, he immobilized Rey and gave Ren the chance to execute the girl who defeated him on Starkiller Base. Ren retrieved his lightsaber, stood up and stepped towards Rey.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> He knew what must be done<ref name="Kylo Ren Bio Gallery" /> and, as Rey predicted, he did indeed turn against his master.<ref name="Rey Bio Gallery" /> Knowing that Snoke could sense his every intent, he turned his lightsaber to Rey while simultaneously his uncle's weapon rotated to face in Snoke's direction. Snoke, who became distracted by the desire to appreciate Rey's impending doom with the Force rather than the approximation afforded by mundane senses, believed that Ren was about to kill his true enemy&mdash;a status he wrongly attributed to Rey.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

[[File:ReyKyloVsGuards.png|thumb|right|269x269px|Ren and Rey stood together as they faced the vengeance of the Elite Praetorian Guard.]]
With a hidden gesture from Ren's free hand, the blue energy blade of Skywalker's lightsaber sprang forth, spearing Snoke through his waist. Almost instantly, Snoke's control on Rey was lost. The blade, which was still under Ren's control, carved through Snoke, cutting him in half before returning to Rey's grasp. After a moment of locking eyes with each other, Ren and Rey stood back-to-back to receive the retaliation of the fallen Supreme Leader's [[Elite Praetorian Guard]]s, who charged towards the Force-sensitive duo from all sides with the intent of avenging his death. Although the two were eventually separated and forced to contend with multiple guards on their own, they both held their own and continued to strike down one Praetorian after another. Ren, who felt both excitement and a hunger for battle, personally killed half the Guards on his own but was disarmed by his fifth opponent, causing Rey to throw the Skywalker lightsaber to him. He swiftly thumbed it on and off, letting the blade pierce through the last Praetorian's head.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

====Ren's proposal====
{{Quote|It's time to let old things die. Snoke, Skywalker. The Sith, the Jedi, the Rebels&hellip; Let it all die. Rey, I want you to join me. We can rule together and bring a new order to the galaxy.|Kylo Ren, to Rey|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}
[[File:Mine mine mine.png|thumb|left|245x245px|Ren and Rey became enemies once more, with neither giving into the other's pleas.]]
Rey, who stared at Ren through eyes filled with joy, beseeched him to help her save the Resistance fleet. To her disbelief and horror, Ren proposed that he and Rey join together and "let old things die," including the Resistance, and bring a new order to the galaxy.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Neither fear or anger influenced his decision; he had chosen to continue down the dark path with a deep resolve.<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> Rey begged Ren to not give into the dark side, but the latter stood behind his convictions. To his frustration, he could see that Rey was still clinging to that futile hope of hers. He urged her to "let go," to admit the truth about her parents&mdash;a truth she had always known but hidden away for years: that her parents had been nothing but junk dealers who had sold her away for drinking money. Rey struggled to control her emotions as she admitted that she knew this, but the revelation that she came from nothing threatened to overwhelm her. At that moment, Ren admitted that Rey was not "nothing" to him.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Ren, who saw Rey as an ally in destroying the past he hated,<ref name="Kylo Ren DB" /> wanted the former scavenger to join him permanently. Motioning her to take his hand, he pleaded with her to stay with him so that they could rule the galaxy together..<ref name="Episode VIII" />

As on Starkiller Base, however,<ref name="Episode VII" /> Rey used the Force to summon the Skywalker lightsaber her grasp. Ren, his entreaty rejected, raised his own hand to harness the Force around the lightsaber, causing it to stop mid-flight. Neither Ren or Rey relented as both continued to call upon the Jedi weapon with equal determination.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> In the midst of their standoff, the lightsaber's kyber crystal wailed through the Force, seeking resonance and harmony where there was nothing but dissonance.<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> The crystal ultimately sheared apart, unleashing a wave of energy that tore the lightsaber in half before consuming the throne room in a flash of brilliant, blinding light. In addition to rendering both Force users unconscious, the shockwave of Force energy coincided with the sacrifice of [[Vice Admiral]] [[Amilyn Holdo]], who crashed the ''Raddus'' into the ''Supremacy'' at lightspeed, splitting the First Order flagship in half before it could destroy all of the Resistance transports.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

===Supreme Leader Kylo Ren===
{{Quote|Our Supreme Leader is dead! We have no ruler&mdash;''"<br />"''The Supreme Leader is dead.''"<br />"''Long live the Supreme Leader&hellip;| Armitage Hux and Kylo Ren|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}
[[File:Long Live The Supreme Leader.png|thumb|right|255x255px|To Hux's chagrin, it was Ren who succeeded Snoke as the new Supreme Leader of the First Order.]]
Ren regained consciousness shortly after Hux reached the throne room. Having killed the Supreme Leader and his guards, Ren falsely accused Rey of murder, claiming that she was the one responsible for Snoke's death. Hux, who had contemplated shooting the fallen knight before he awoke, informed Ren that the girl escaped from the ''Supremacy'' using Snoke's private shuttle.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

Realizing that Rey had awoken before him, Ren pondered why she had spared his life, knowing he was at her mercy while in an unconscious state. It then occurred to Ren that Rey could, in fact, care about him. Regardless, he dismissed it as a sign of sentimental weakness that would eventually lead to Rey's destruction.<ref name="Expanded Edition" />

Knowing that Rey would travel to [[Crait]] in an effort to save the Resistance,<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> Ren ordered Hux to send their forces to the planet where they would end the war and his mother's movement for good. Hux scoffed at the notion of taking orders from his longtime rival and reminded Ren that the [[First Order army|army]] answered to their general. In addition, he pointed out that, without a Supreme Leader, the First Order was cast into a state of disarray. Before he could go on, the General's protests were suddenly silenced by Ren, who applied the [[Force choke]] technique on Hux. Overtaken by fear, Hux grudgingly pledged his allegiance to Ren, whom he hailed as Snoke's successor.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Even so, Ren remained distrustful of Hux and chose to keep the General close by as a safeguard against treachery.<ref name="Expanded Edition" />

====Battle of Crait====
{{Quote|General Hux, advance. No quarter. No prisoners.|Kylo Ren, to Armitage Hux|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}
[[File:Battery Ram Cannon.jpg|thumb|left|270x270px|Ren, who led the First Order's assault on the Resistance's last redoubt, ordered his soldiers to annihilate his mother's insurgents.]]
As far as the new Supreme Leader was concerned, the [[Battle of Crait]] would be the last battle in the war between the First Order and the Resistance. He would give no quarter to his enemies or take a single prisoner. Looming overhead in his command shuttle, Ren oversaw the deployment of [[First Order All Terrain Armored Transport|AT-ATs]], [[All Terrain MegaCaliber Six|AT-M6s]], and [[First Order All Terrain Scout Transport|AT-STs]] to the salt-covered surface of Crait, gathered from what remained of the ''Supremacy''. It would be a relatively straightforward operation, with Ren's forces marching on an [[Crait outpost|abandoned rebel base]] which the Resistance had appropriated for its defense.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

When the First Order discovered a massive shield door impeding their advance into the enclosure, Ren further deployed a [[superlaser siege cannon]]&mdash;a sort of battering ram equipped with miniaturized Death Star technology&mdash;to his advantage. In response, the Resistance launched a number of old [[V-4X-D ski speeder|ski speeders]], an ultimately futile attempt to stop the cannon. While the Resistance attempted to halt the First Order's progress, Chewbacca and Rey joined the fray in the ''Millennium Falcon'', and Ren furiously sent every TIE fighter present to destroy his father's old ship.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

====Confrontation with Luke Skywalker====
{{Quote|I've failed you, Ben. I'm sorry.''"<br />"''I'm sure you are! The Resistance is dead! The war is over, and when I kill you, I will have killed the last Jedi!''"<br />"''Amazing. Every word of what you just said was wrong. The rebellion is reborn today. The war is just beginning, and I will not be the last Jedi.|Luke Skywalker and Kylo Ren|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}
[[File:Family Reunion.png|thumb|right|262x262px|Ren challenged his uncle Luke Skywalker to single combat, intending to finish what Darth Vader began by killing the last Jedi.]]
Shortly after the First Order breached the base, Luke Skywalker appeared and Ren, in a futile attempt to eliminate his uncle, ordered all of his forces to fire at him. After Skywalker shrugged off the attack virtually unharmed, Ren ordered his command shuttle to be set down. Hux tried to advise him against what he considered a waste of time, but Ren thrashed the General against the wall with the Force, knocking him unconscious. The nearby pilot needed no further prodding and complied with the command.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

The time had come for Ren to face Skywalker personally. He slowly advanced until he was but a few meters from the old Jedi. He tauntingly asked if Skywalker had come to be his salvation. Skywalker answered half-heartedly in the negative. Then lightsabers were drawn. Skywalker made no effort to harm his nephew and only moved to avoid Ren's attacks. He apologized for failing in his duty as Ben Solo's mentor, but Ren took it with sarcasm and declared that the war had ended with the death of the Resistance. In addition, he stated that Skywalker would die as well, marking the end of the Jedi Order itself. He was wrong on all accounts; according to Skywalker, the war had just begun, the Rebellion was reborn, and he would not die as the last of the Jedi.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

Ren felt that Skywalker was talking about Rey, the old man's supposed "Chosen One."<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> He vowed that he would see her annihilated, along with Skywalker and "all of it." In response, Skywalker turned off his lightsaber. He warned his nephew against striking him down in anger, otherwise Skywalker would always be with Ren, just like Han Solo. It was thus that he opened himself up for the final blow.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

[[File:Kylo Ren looking at Rey.png|thumb|left|259x259px|Ren was shut out by Rey after the Force reconnected them, leaving the Supreme Leader alone and unable to revel in his accomplishments.]]
Ren charged at Skywalker once more until he slashed through him with no effect. Confused, he pointed his lightsaber in the Grand Master's direction and moved forward until the blade harmlessly passed through his uncle again, revealing that Skywalker was not actually present for the battle; he had been projecting himself through the Force from Ahch-To. With one final chiding goodbye, the image had vanished.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

At that moment, Ren realized what had his uncle had done: by distracting him, the old Jedi had bought time for the remaining members of the Resistance to escape. Hux had been right all along. Angered by the deception, Ren, Hux and their forces scoured the now-empty base, but finding only a projection of his father's golden hanging dice, all Ren could do was kneel in defeat as they vanished from his hand. As the Resistance evacuated, Ren saw Rey once more as she boarded the ''Millennium Falcon''; no words were said as she closed the door on him,<ref name="Episode VIII" /> although Ren sensed that Rey felt neither hatred nor compassion for him.<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> Ren had become Supreme Leader, all but destroyed most of his mother's movement and struck down his uncle, but that didn't feel much like a victory.<ref name="Kylo Ren Bio Gallery" />

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Yes. There it is. You have too much of your father's heart in you, young Solo.''"<br />"''I ''killed'' Han Solo. When the moment came I didn't hesitate.''"<br />"''And look at you. The deed split your spirit to the bone.|Snoke and Kylo Ren|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}
[[File:Kylo Ren OOTD.png|thumb|right|381x381px|Kylo Ren saw himself as the rightful heir to the legacy of his grandfather Darth Vader.]]
Kylo Ren was the embodiment of conflict. The dark warrior, whose blood flowed with the legacy of some of the most powerful Jedi and Sith in galactic [[Timeline of galactic history|history]], represented a focal point between the dark side and the light, a balance that made him a target of Supreme Leader Snoke so Ren's powers could be used to further the ambitions of the First Order. His fall to the dark side suppressed the boy who had once been named Ben Solo, a name that the Supreme Leader decreed could never be spoken in the First Order.<ref name="Secrets of TFA breakdown" />

Even prior to his descent, however, Solo nonetheless had deep-seated insecurities rooted from Han Solo and Leia Organa's neglect in raising him.<ref name="Secrets of TFA breakdown" /> He also believed that his parents thought he was disturbed, having overheard their conversations about him and his perceived lack of control over his innate Force abilities when he was still a child.<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> As a result, he interpreted his mother's decision to send him away for Jedi training as her way of abandoning him.<ref name="Secrets of TFA breakdown" /> Despite his feelings of desertion, Ren did not hate his parents. Although the act of patricide led Rey&mdash;who did not understand the dark warrior's motive for killing his father&mdash;to believe that Ren loathed Han, Ren confessed that it was not hatred which had caused him to strike down the elder Solo.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Whereas he struggled against his conscience to take the life of his father,<ref name="Han Solo Bio Gallery">{{Databank|han-solo-biography-gallery|Han Solo Biography Gallery|archivedate=20170602222850}}</ref> he could not bring himself to commit matricide.<ref name="Expanded Edition" />

As Kylo Ren, he strove to bury his past, though the painful experiences and emotions from his youth were nonetheless something he could channel in order to further his own power. He ultimately hoped to build an immunity to the light, and to succeed where Darth Vader failed.<ref name="TFA VD" /> Although he intended to adhere fully to the dark side's teachings, he did ultimately have reservations to what he deemed to be unnecessary casualties, as evidenced by his speaking out against the ordered destruction of the [[Ileenium system]] before being outvoted by Snoke.<ref name="TFA novel" /> After the Battle of Starkiller Base, Ren reflected on his duel with Rey and how she regarded him as a "monster." By then, he too saw himself as a monster.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

[[File:Kylo Ren Vader Helmet Chamber.jpg|thumb|left|251x251px|Ren idolized his grandfather, whose helmet he kept as a reminder of the dark side's power and weakness.]]
Like Vader before him, Ren believed it was his destiny to rule over the weaker beings of the galaxy. He idolized his grandfather, but only the darkness that was Darth Vader&mdash;not the light of Anakin Skywalker. To Ren and the Supreme Leader, it was not poor strategy or arrogance that brought about the fall of the Galactic Empire: it was the sentimentality Vader held for his son, Luke Skywalker, which led to the Sith Lord's redemption; a foolish error in judgment and a momentary lapse in an otherwise great life. Ren believed that if Vader had not succumbed to the light, the Empire would have prevailed.<ref name="TFA novel" /> He kept a shrine to Vader in his personal chambers aboard the ''Finalizer'', with the charred remains of the Sith Lord's helmet that had been recovered from his [[Funeral of Anakin Skywalker|funeral pyre]] on Endor, as both a monument to the dark side's powers and its weakness.<ref name="TFA VD" /> He also kept a table of ashes made from the remains of his enemies.<ref name="JJ Abrams Kylo Ren Ashes">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/04/05/star-wars-force-awakens-jj-abrams-kylo-ren-ashes|title=What was Kylo Ren's strange table of ashes in ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens''?|first=Anthony|last=Breznican|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=2016-04-05|accessdate=2016-04-05}}</ref>

Similar to his father, Han Solo, Ren had a sarcastic sense of humor. During the attack on Tuanul, he told Lor San Tekka that the latter was "so right" just before decapitating him, in reference to the old man's claim that Ren could not escape the truth about his heritage. Ren's sarcasm was also evident during the interrogation of Poe Dameron, whom the dark warrior asked if he was "comfortable." Shortly afterward, Ren posed a rhetorical question to General Hux in regards to the reliability of First Order stormtroopers, only to answer his own query by denouncing all of them as potential traitors.<ref name="Episode VII" />

[[File:KyloIsNotKyboRen-TFAT2-4KPub.jpg|thumb|right|258x258px|Ren wore a mask not only to hide his former identity, but also to project a more intimidating persona.]]
Though Ren feared the light and knew he had to avoid Vader's sentimentality,<ref name="TFA VD" /> the Supreme Leader nonetheless encouraged him to use the heritage of both the light and the dark, which only furthered Ren's inner conflict.<ref name="CEUE" /> He studied both the skills of the Jedi and arcane dark side lore, contradictory teachings that gave him his power through discord. These teachings made the often angry dark warrior, one whose great temper was honed to be a weapon of the First Order, the archetype of a new kind of dark-side user that filled the void left behind when the Sith were destroyed during the Battle of Endor.<ref name="TFA VD" />

Ren struggled to control his temper, yet often failed in his efforts when dealing with setbacks<ref name="Episode VII" /> or criticism,<ref name="Episode VIII" /> resulting in destructive tantrums such as the destruction of computer terminals as well as his interrogation chamber. His tantrums appeared to have been common enough that any nearby stormtrooper avoided the area he was currently destroying.<ref name="Episode VII" /> He struggled to keep his temper in check while listening to Snoke's disparaging remarks, only to feel the dark side rising within him to the point where he was physically unable to keep it contained, causing him to take a defiant stand against Snoke until his master subdued him with the Force. Once dismissed, however, Ren unleashed the dark side in the form of a violent outburst of emotion, destroying his helmet and damaging the elevator in the process.<ref name="Episode VIII" /><ref name="Expanded Edition" /> In addition to his temperament, Ren was known for his lack of patience, particularly in meetings with members of [[High Command (First Order)|High Command]] such as General Hux.<ref name="Phasma" />

[[File:Episode VIII Snoke and Kylo Ren.png|thumb|left|259x259px|Though he projected the air of a loyal apprentice, especially in Snoke's presence, Ren cunningly plotted his own path to power.]]
At first, Ren sought to regain his master's approval which he lost as a result of his failure at Starkiller Base, in spite of how Snoke's criticism angered him.<ref name="Kylo Ren DB" /> By then, his emotions were more churned up than ever before, as observed by Snoke, due to his patricidal actions.<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> He had believed that his father's death would complete his journey to the dark side; instead, it worsened the conflict within him as Ren continued to feel the pull to the light side of the Force.<ref name="TFA novel" /> Despite the effect that Han's death had on Ren, the dark warrior justified his father's death as a stepping stone in his destiny. Even so, the conflict within Ren<ref name="Han Solo Bio Gallery" /> filled him with doubt and uncertainty when presented with two choices: to either kill his father or return home with him.<ref name="Episode VII" /> Ultimately, he killed Han out of a desperate need<ref name="Episode VII" /> to free himself from his emotional attachments.<ref name="Kylo Ren Bio Gallery" />

[[File:Take that ridiculous thing off.png|thumb|right|234x234px|Beneath the theatrics of Kylo Ren's helmet, Ben Solo was being torn apart by the conflict between the dark side and the light within him.]]
The first time Ren met Rey, he was puzzled by the strange connection he felt with the scavenger from Jakku. He was further surprised by Rey's ability to access Ren's mind while he probed hers, allowing her to see his thoughts as well as his conflicts and doubts.<ref name="Kylo Ren Bio Gallery" /> According to Snoke, Rey's connection with the Force was not the cause of Ren's inability to successfully probe her mind&mdash;it was the compassion he felt for her that got in the way. Ren was in denial for he could not fathom how he could feel anything other than hate for an enemy of the First Order.<ref name="TFA novel" /> Nevertheless, he offered to make Rey his apprentice after gauging her raw strength in the Force.<ref name="Episode VII" /> Even after she defeated him, Ren was preoccupied by what he sensed from her; that their destinies were somehow intertwined.<ref name="Kylo Ren Bio Gallery" /> From that point forward, much of Ren's churning emotions were about Rey.<ref name="Expanded Edition" />

[[File:A Child With A Mask.png|thumb|left|246x246px|Dismissed by his master as "a child in a mask," Ren destroyed his helmet and sought to claim his future by "letting old things die."]]
His emotional state became even more intense as their Force-bond grew stronger;<ref name="Kylo Ren Bio Gallery" /> to Rey's surprise, Ren no longer bothered trying to hide his pain and misery from her.<ref name="Rey Bio Gallery" /> He allowed Rey to confide in him and reassured her that she was not alone.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Later, as Rey lay at the mercy of Snoke, all of Ren's doubts gave way to a newfound sense of purpose and determination<ref name="Expanded Edition" />&mdash;he knew what he had to do.<ref name="Kylo Ren Bio Gallery" /> Instead of executing Rey as his master commanded, Ren resolved to kill Snoke and take his place with Rey at his side. Despite knowing that Rey was a woman of no significant background, Ren reassured her that she still meant something to him. He envisioned himself and Rey ruling together as the architects of a new galactic order,<ref name="Episode VIII" /> but her refusal caused Ren to feel betrayed<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> and he vowed to destroy Rey along with everyone else who opposed him.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> However, when Rey blocked him as soon as the Force reconnected them, Ren was left feeling anything but victorious in spite of how he overthrew his master, all but destroyed his mother's movement and struck down Luke Skywalker.<ref name="Kylo Ren Bio Gallery" />

[[File:Rey and Ben Solo.png|thumb|right|258x258px|Ren understood Rey's feelings of abandonment and solitude, having experienced them as well during his formative years.]]
Ben Solo was a human [[Sexes|male]]<ref name="Kylo Ren DB" /> who stood at 1.89 [[meter]]s<ref name="CEUE" /> and weighed 89 [[kilogram]]s.<ref name="TFA head to head" /> He had black [[hair]], brown eyes, and light skin.<ref name="Episode VII" /> As Kylo Ren, he often kept his face covered with a mask modeled on the battle gear of the Knights of Ren. His mask projected and amplified his voice in a deeper way, and his robes were a remnant of his training with the Supreme Leader and became singed from many battles. These elements combined to make Ren an intimidating presence as he boldly stepped onto the battlefield, where he sometimes arrived after victory was secured, yet he had no fear of battle. He boldly strode into battle, confident in his powers and his purpose.<ref name="TFA VD" /> As a child, Solo's eyes appeared ancient to his father. From Han's perspective, it was as though his son had been waiting for a millennium just to be born.<ref name="Last Shot" />

==Powers and abilities==
{{Quote|The mighty Kylo Ren. When I found you, I saw what all masters live to see: raw, untamed power. And beyond that, something truly special&mdash;The potential of your bloodline. A new Vader.|Snoke, to Kylo Ren|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}
[[File:Force Stop SWD.png|thumb|left|196x196px|Like his grandfather, Ren was strong with the dark side of the Force and possessed great skill with telekinetic abilities.]]
The heir to the Skywalker bloodline,<ref name="Snoke Bio Gallery">{{Databank|supreme-leader-snoke-biography-gallery|Supreme Leader Snoke Biography Gallery}}</ref> Ben Solo was filled with immense raw, untamed power that frightened his uncle, Luke Skywalker and attracted the attention of Snoke.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> The Supreme Leader recognized the young Solo as a Jedi of potentially limitless power and, therefore, conspired to bring that power into his service<ref name="Snoke Bio Gallery" /> at the expense of the resurgent Jedi Order.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> After becoming Kylo Ren, Skywalker's fallen apprentice was tasked with destroying any remnants of the Jedi, including his own uncle, whose attempt to restore the Jedi Order was thwarted when Ren betrayed him and the other Jedi students.<ref name="TFA VD" /> Ren wanted to be as powerful as Darth Vader,<ref name="Episode VII" /> who began the elimination of the Jedi at the end of the Clone Wars,<ref name="Episode III" /> but was afraid he would not be as strong as the Sith Lord once was. Though not yet at the heights of his grandfather's or his uncle's power, Ren's abilities still gave him powerful abilities with the Force and in combat.<ref name="Episode VII" />

[[File:Son of Darkness.png|thumb|right|240x240px|Ren's extraordinary powers were complemented by his skills in lightsaber combat.]]
The dark side that flowed through him made him a nearly unstoppable force, and he was exceptionally skilled in telekinetic attacks and defenses. He notably used this to send Rey flying against a tree and to pull Dopheld Mitaka by the neck to his hand, as well as to hold him up with one hand while still pulling them with the Force.<ref name="TFA VD" /> When defending himself from Skywalker the night his master came close to murdering him, Ren was able to telekinetically collapse an entire hut on Luke while keeping it from harming him and clashing blades with Skywalker at the same time.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> He was proficient enough to use telekinetic halts in combat, which notably allowed him to freeze the motion of a target, allowing him to immobilize and restrain people and even to hold a blaster bolt midair for over a minute. He was also able to manipulate the movements of living beings, which allowed him to force Rey to point her blaster at the floor as he simultaneously froze her in place.<ref name="TFA head to head" />

[[File:Force-bond.png|thumb|left|239x239px|The Force-bond between Ren and Rey enabled them to commune with each other across the stars.]]
Ren also excelled in interrogation, as he could telepathically invade the minds of his prisoners and psychologically torture them into revealing withheld information. His abilities also allowed him to render opponents unconscious without harming them, as he did to Rey on Takodana, causing her to fall asleep with a wave of his hand so he could capture her without resistance.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Ren, who pulled from the teachings of the light and the dark to hone his power, possessed superb skills in [[lightsaber combat]]. His destruction of Skywalker's new generation of Jedi earned him the nickname of "Jedi Killer" amongst the First Order ranks, and his skills with a lightsaber were what ultimately prevented the art of lightsaber combat from returning to prominence as he eliminated the remnants of the Jedi. His own skills at constructing a lightsaber were limited, however; the design and crude components of his unstable weapon reflected a lack of experience at constructing the ancient weapon.<ref name="TFA VD" />

[[File:Kylo Ren's Makeshift Jar'Kai.jpg|thumb|right|255x255px|Ren's swordsmanship extended to the use of Jar'Kai.]]
Ren displayed a remarkable tolerance for pain and durability, as he could survive a long ranged blast from [[Chewbacca's bowcaster]]. Although he clearly sustained severe injury, he only briefly doubled over in pain, despite the weapon being able to kill armored stormtroopers instantly on impact. He could also cut ahead of Rey and FN-2187 in this state, demonstrating remarkable [[Force Dash|speed]]. Even after being injured, Ren still proved very formidable, displaying great prowess in an acrobatic and offensive form of lightsaber combat in his duel against FN-2187, a former stormtrooper with specialized training, fairly quickly besting him, although not before he got cut in the shoulder. He even utilized his wound to further hone his power in the dark side by punching himself directly on the wound, hard enough to spurt out blood. Despite his skill with a lightsaber, although he did have the upper hand initially,<ref name="Episode VII" /> the imbalance caused by Han Solo's murder caused him to be defeated by Rey<ref name="Episode VIII" />&mdash;whose own life as a scavenger on Jakku was spent honing her survival skills&mdash;an untrained girl fueled by anger and raw strength during her confrontation with the injured dark knight.<ref name="Rey Bio Gallery" /> Nevertheless, Luke Skywalker regarded Ren as a strong adversary who was far more powerful than Rey.<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 4">''[[The Last Jedi Adaptation 4]]''</ref>

[[File:Kylo Ren Pilots Silencer.jpeg|thumb|left|252x252px|Hailing from a family of expert pilots, Ren inherited the flying skills of his father and maternal grandfather.]]
Although Snoke was capable of probing his apprentice's mind, Ren used this to his advantage by tricking his master into believing that he intended to kill Rey when, in fact, his actual target was Snoke himself. Afterward, Ren defeated the Elite Praetorian Guard&mdash;warriors trained to kill Force-sensitives&mdash;through a combination of his lightsaber skills, Force abilities and unarmed combat, as well as with the help of Rey. Although they were separated from each other during the duel, Ren successfully defended himself against four guards while Rey held off the remaining two. Despite being outnumbered and surrounded, he single-handedly killed four guards on his own and the last with Rey's assistance. During the fight, he displayed proficiency in [[Jar'Kai]], using a dead guard's [[vibro-voulge]] as an improvised weapon in conjunction with his lightsaber.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

Ren was also an excellent pilot,<ref name="TIE silencer DB">{{Databank|tie-silencer|TIE silencer}}</ref> having inherited the piloting skills of both his grandfather and father, Anakin Skywalker and Han Solo, respectively.<ref name="TLJ:ICS">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: Incredible Cross-Sections]]''</ref> Utilizing [[Kylo Ren's TIE silencer|his personal]] TIE/vn space superiority fighter, Ren led the First Order's initial attack on the Resistance fleet. He was able to evade the ''Raddus''{{'}} defenses and destroy the vessel's starfighter hangar, owing to his own talents as a pilot.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

==Behind the scenes==
===Creation and development===
{{Quote|I've written four ''Star Wars'' movies now, and there's never been a character quite like the one that Adam [Driver] plays.

Then they have to deal with their emotions as best they can, with what they are.|''The Force Awakens'' co-writer Lawrence Kasdan, on Kylo Ren|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/08/12/star-wars-force-awakens-kylo-ren}}
[[File:Kylo Ren Helmet.jpg|thumb|right|242x242px|Several unused helmet designs were considered for the "Jedi Killer," the character who became Kylo Ren]]
On [[October 30]], [[2012]], [[The Walt Disney Company]] purchased [[Lucasfilm Ltd.|Lucasfilm]] from [[George Lucas]], the creator of ''[[Star Wars]]'', and announced that they would be making the long-awaited ''Star Wars'' [[sequel trilogy]], beginning with [[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII]] in [[2015]]. In the months prior, as Lucasfilm co-chair (and eventual president) [[Kathleen Kennedy]] began the work to produce the new slate of films, it became clear to the creative team that the story could not just rely on characters from the previous films but would have to introduce new characters to carry the franchise forward.<ref name="Art of TFA">''[[The Art of Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''</ref>

Since George Lucas' earliest versions of the film's story, a son of Han Solo and Leia Organa struggling with the dark side of the Force was always in the mix. In some of these versions, the son's name was "Skyler" and he was corrupted to the dark side by [[Darth Talon]], a character originally created for the [[Dark Horse Comics]]' ''[[Star Wars: Legacy]]'' [[comic book]] series.<ref name="George's Original Plans">{{Cite_web|url=https://naboonews.wordpress.com/2018/01/04/george-lucas-wanted-darth-talon-to-corrupt-han-and-leias-son-in-episode-vii/|title=George Lucas wanted Darth Talon to corrupt Han and Leia’s son in Episode VII|accessdate=2018-09-21|date=2018-01-04|work=Naboo News|publisher=naboonews.wordpress.com}}</ref> Talon's role was then morphed into that of the "Jedi Killer", the initial name of the character who evolved into Kylo Ren, which was used throughout the film's pre-production before the director and co-writer [[J.J. Abrams]] and his team settled on a name for the character. The character's design went through a number of iterations before the final design was approved on [[March 11]], [[2014]]. One design made him look similar to Darth Vader. According to concept artist [[Christian Alzmann]], the idea behind the similarity was that Darth Vader, as a Lord of the Sith, was not a "one-off" look. Instead, "he has a specific title and a specific look that goes with that title. Even though the mask was helping him breathe, there was still a certain look to it." Concept artist [[Glyn Dillon]], who designed the final look of the character, said that the design of the Jedi Killer was like "trying to land a helicopter on a penny. We couldn't be too Vader-ish, but we couldn't reference something else too heavily, either".<ref name="Art of TFA" />

[[File:Kylo Ren concept art Guavian.png|thumb|left|229x229px|Kylo Ren's "Jedi Killer" concept art inspired the design of the Guavian security soldiers.]]
Additional design concepts showed the Jedi Killer as someone who ate matter from stars. He would be in a meditation chamber, where energies from a sun could come into the room and he would consume whatever power was within it. Another piece of art showed him with a more robotic look, holding the mask of Darth Vader; at one point, the mask of Darth Vader was a central element to the film, before becoming part of the shrine that Kylo Ren had in the final story. One rejected piece of concept art showed the Jedi Killer with a red and black mask with a circular pattern in the center. This design later inspired the appearance of the [[Guavian security soldier]]s, the cybernetically enhanced security soldiers of the [[Guavian Death Gang]].<ref name="Art of TFA" />

Other designs the crew worked on included a fortress for the Jedi Killer. Concept artist [[Doug Chiang]] took "iconic shapes that we know from ''Star Wars''" but put "different material on them&mdash;in this case turning them into concrete instead of that slick painted metal." The crew also considered giving the Jedi Killer his own droid, such as a torture droid or something else that looked ominous.<ref name="Art of TFA" /> The idea of the Jedi Killer having an interrogation droid ultimately made it into the film, with Kylo Ren using interrogation droids and other torture techniques to break his prisoners.<ref name="TFA VD" />

The final design was meant to be memorable, much like Darth Vader's mask&mdash;upon which Ren's look was intentionally based. Costumer designer [[Michael Kaplan]] said that Abrams wanted the look to be memorable for kids, and that Abrams loved the final design when it was presented. In developing the character, original screenwriter [[Michael Arndt]], whose screenwriting duties were taken over by Abrams and co-writer [[Lawrence Kasdan]] when Arndt departed the project, the character's backstory came about because the writers needed a rationale for the heroes of the [[original trilogy]] to have separated after the events of the [[1983]] film [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]. Abrams wanted Episode VII, which came to be named ''The Force Awakens'', to tap into parental fears of a child gone wrong through Kylo Ren.<ref name="EW Kylo Shock">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/12/21/jj-abrams-kylo-ren-shocking-act-star-wars-force-awakens|title=We Need To Talk About Kylo|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=2015-12-21|first=Anthony|last=Breznican|accessdate=2016-03-21}}</ref> He also wanted the film to tell the story of someone who was still becoming a villain, saying that the only reason why Ren had "any hope of being a worthy successor" to the iconic Darth Vader was because he kills Han Solo. "There's nothing I could think of that is more hideous than patricide" Abrams said, "especially when it comes to Han Solo".<ref name="Abrams on Kylo">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fandango.com/movie-news/jj-abrams-on-how-harrison-ford-reacted-to-that-big-moment-in-star-wars-the-force-awakens-750544|title=J.J.

[[File:C-GA War.jpg|thumb|right|214x214px|Ren shares some similarities with Jacen Solo, the son of Leia and Han in ''Star Wars'' Legends, who became the Sith Lord Darth Caedus.]]
Ren's parentage was initially to have been revealed earlier in ''The Force Awakens'', when Ren speaks to Darth Vader's helmet. Ren calling Vader his grandfather would have been the reveal, and the scene was written to take place shortly after Finn and Dameron escaped from the ''Finalizer''. Ren would have blamed himself for not having done anything about Finn's change of heart regarding the First Order, and he would have sought the counsel of his grandfather for guidance. Eventually, the film's editors, [[Mary Jo Markey]] and [[Maryann Brandon]], felt that the revelation came too early and it was a waste of a good moment. Instead of its original placement, they moved the scene later in the film to foreshadow Han Solo's death.<ref name="Vader Scene Edit">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/star-wars-force-awakens-editors-852465|title='Star Wars: The Force Awakens' Editors Explain the Timing of a Key Kylo Ren Scene|work=The Hollywood Reporter|first=Carolyn|last=Giardina|date=2016-01-06|accessdate=2016-03-21}}</ref>

Kylo Ren shares some similarities with [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]], the son of [[Leia Organa Solo]] and [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] in the now non-[[canon]]ical [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] storyline. Jacen, the twin brother of [[Jaina Solo Fel]], was a [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] who ultimately turned to the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]] and became the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord]] Darth Caedus. It was Jacen's hope to lead the [[Galactic Federation of Free Alliances|Galactic Alliance]] in bringing order to [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] after the horrors of the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]]. He killed his aunt [[Mara Jade Skywalker]],<ref name="LOTF Sacrifice">''[[Legacy of the Force: Sacrifice]]''</ref> and committed atrocities across the galaxy before he was finally killed by his sister.<ref name="LOTF Invincible">''[[Legacy of the Force: Invincible]]''</ref> Ren also has an incredibly similar name to that of [[Gir Kybo Ren-Cha|Kybo Ren]], a space pirate from the Legends animated series ''[[Star Wars: Droids: The Adventures of R2-D2 and C-3PO]]''.<ref name="The Pirates of Tarnoonga">{{DroidsCite|The Pirates of Tarnoonga}}</ref> Additionally, Kylo Ren's helmet resembles the [[Revan's mask|mask]] of [[Revan]], a [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] who first appeared in the [[2003]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]''.<ref name="SW:KotOR">''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]''</ref>

===Casting and portrayal===
{{Quote|When they think of their actions as morally justified, it makes them dangerous and unpredictable. There's no level they won't go to to accomplish what they're after.

[[File:AdamDriver 2.jpg|thumb|left|237x237px|Kylo Ren is played by Adam Driver, whom J.J. Abrams said brings a "wonderful ferocity" to the role.]]
Kylo Ren was portrayed by [[Adam Driver]] in ''The Force Awakens'', a role he reprised in the [[2017]] sequel [[Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VIII ''The Last Jedi'']].<ref name="VIII Filming">{{SW|url=news/star-wars-episode-viii-now-filming|text=''Star Wars: Episode VIII'' Now Filming|archivedate=20170812225137}}</ref> Abrams originally saw other actors for the role, including [[Wikipedia:Eddie Redmayne|Eddie Redmayne]], who had been cast in other films by casting director [[Nina Gold]], but all of them lost out to Driver.<ref name="Kylo Redmayne">{{Cite_web|url=https://uproxx.com/movies/eddie-redmayne-auditioned-for-kylo-ren/|title=Eddie Redmayne Talks About The Time He Auditioned For Kylo Ren|accessdate=2018-09-21|date=2016-11-08|work=[[Wikipedia:Upprox|Upprox]]|publisher=uproxx.com}}</ref> Driver didn't need to audition for the role, however, and instead had a meet and greet with Abrams where the director wanted to get a look at the actor. Just as Abrams had to consider whether or not to cast Driver, the actor had to decide whether he wanted to take the part at all.<ref name="Howard Stern">{{Cite web|url=https://www.howardstern.com/film/24783-how-adam-driver-got-his-huge-star-wars-roleand-then-had-think-about-it/|title=How Adam Driver Got His Huge 'Star Wars' Role...And Then Had to Think About It|work=Howard Stern|date=December 1, 2015|accessdate=March 21, 2016}}</ref> Abrams described Driver has having a "wonderful ferocity that was perfect for this character."<ref name="EW Abrams Driver">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/11/30/jj-abrams-adam-driver-kylo-ren-star-wars-force-awakens|title=J.J.

Driver does not see Ren as a villain, a stance he took in order to get into the head of the character and portray him as well as possible. Rather, Driver sees him as a religious fanatic who sees his actions as morally justified. This makes Ren more dangerous and unpredictable for the actor, as there is no level that Ren will not go to in order to accomplish his objectives.<ref name="Empire Kylo">{{Cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/star-wars-exclusive-new-look-adam-driver-kylo-ren/|title=Star Wars exclusive: new image of Adam Driver's Kylo Ren|first=John|last=Nugent|work=EMPIRE|date=November 19, 2015|accessdate=March 21, 2016}}</ref> Getting into Ren's head was one part of Driver's method-acting approach. On set, Driver often stayed in character, keeping his helmet on to do so. Co-star [[John Boyega]], who plays Finn, recalled that acting with Driver was intense because Driver wanted to forget he was in ''Star Wars'' and take the role as seriously as any other role he had ever played.<ref name="Driver Method">{{Cite web|url=http://screencrush.com/adam-driver-method-acting-star-wars/|title=Adam Driver Stayed in Character as Kylo Ren While Filming 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens'|first=Mike|last=Sampson|work=ScreenCrush|date=December 2, 2015|accessdate=March 21, 2016}}</ref> The process of getting into Ren's costume provided an extra motivation for the actor; Driver said that by the time he was in the costume and ready to shoot, the "cumbersome and difficult" process left him feeling "so pissed by the time we were ready to start shooting that I felt totally ready."<ref name="Secrets SXSW">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/03/14/star-wars-secrets-force-awakens-sxsw-premiere|title=10 revelations from the ''Secrets of the Force Awakens'' SXSW premiere|first=Kevin P.|last=Sullivan|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=March 14, 2016|accessdate=March 21, 2016}}</ref>

In previous roles, Driver did not watch his performance because he preferred to not see himself on screen. He comes from a theater background, where actors never saw their own performances, and always hated noticing mistakes that he could not correct. He made an exception for ''The Force Awakens'', however, and watched the film in a private screening with just his co-stars [[Daisy Ridley]] and [[Carrie Fisher]], who played Rey and Leia Organa respectively. He felt comfortable sitting through the film and watching it with them because of how much time and effort he and his co-stars put into the film.<ref name="Howard Stern" />

Besides his standard actor Adam Driver, he also had two voice actors in ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront II]]'', one for while he wore the mask, and the other for when he had the mask removed. The former was voiced by [[Matthew Wood]], who previously voiced General [[Grievous]] in various ''Star Wars'' media, while the latter was voiced by [[Roger Craig Smith]].<ref name="Battlefront II" />

For the film's [[Star Wars: The Force Awakens (soundtrack)|soundtrack]], composer [[John Williams]] wrote a theme for Kylo Ren that first appears in the track "[[Main Title and The Attack on the Jakku Village]]." It is reprised throughout the film, including in "Kylo Ren Arrives at the Battle."<ref name="Soundtrack">[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens (soundtrack)|''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' soundtrack]]</ref> In composing the theme, Williams approached it as an extension of Darth Vader and "[[The Imperial March]]," without it being too similar. He wanted the theme to convey Ren's great and evil power and strength, as well as the threat he posed. These elements came together to create a theme that could be instantly accessible to the audience.<ref name="Sound of a Galaxy">{{SW|url=video/the-sound-of-a-galaxy-inside-the-star-wars-the-force-awakens-soundtrack|text=The Sound of a Galaxy: Inside the Star Wars: The Force Awakens Soundtrack}}</ref>

Kylo Ren was well received by critics upon the release of ''The Force Awakens''.

===In popular culture===
On [[January 17]], [[2016]], Driver hosted the popular sketch comedy show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and filmed a sketch called "Undercover Boss: Starkiller Base." Parodying the show ''[[Wikipedia:Undercover Boss|Undercover Boss]]'', Kylo Ren disguises himself as a radar technician named Matt and mingles with the crew of Starkiller Base to learn more about what it is like to work on the base. Throughout the sketch, in which he becomes friends with a Lieutenant Colonel named Zack ([[Wikipedia:Taran Killam|Taran Killam]]), whose son he killed months earlier, Ren displays his fiery temper on numerous occasions, particularly when crew members criticized Ren without knowing who they were speaking to. In the end, Ren says that he feels he understands the crew of Starkiller Base better and that he is ready to show everyone a brand new Kylo Ren&mdash;as Zack's lifeless body sits in the background.<ref name="Undercover Starkiller">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaOSCASqLsE Star Wars Undercover Boss: Starkiller Base - SNL]</ref>

[[File:Kylo Chamber.jpg|thumb|left|265x265px|"Ben Swolo," as described by fans, was the product of "Matt" seeing Ren shredded.]]
In the skit, "Matt" comments to a group of stormtroopers that a friend told him that he saw Kylo Ren in the [[shower]] and that Ren "had an eight-pack" and was "shredded." These lines proved a source of retroactive amusement when ''The Last Jedi'' featured a scene in which Ren appears to Rey shirtless and sporting a heavily muscled chest. However, director Rian Johnson stated that the scene was not merely gratuitous, but was intended to establish that through their Force bond, Rey could actually see his body and not simply hear his voice or see just his face and eyes.<ref name="shirtless">{{Cite web|url=https://movieweb.com/kylo-ren-shirtless-last-jedi-why-it-happened/|title=Why That Shirtless Kylo Ren Scene Had to Happen in Last Jedi|first=Kevin|last=Burwick|date=December 21, 2017|accessdate=December 23, 2017|publisher=MovieWeb}}</ref>

Kylo Ren was confirmed to appear in the upcoming attraction [[Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge|''Star Wars'': Galaxy's Edge]] in one of several promotional trading cards for the ride that were handed out during the [[December 16]], 2017 "Galactic Nights" event.
