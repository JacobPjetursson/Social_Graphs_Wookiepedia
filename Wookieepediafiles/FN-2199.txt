{{Quote|Traitor!|FN-2199, to Finn|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}
'''FN-2199''', nicknamed "'''Nines'''," was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtrooper]] who served the [[First Order]] in the [[Standard decade|decades]] following the [[Galactic Civil War]]. He served alongside his friend and brother-in-arms, [[Finn|FN-2187]]. Following [[FN Corps|FN]]-2187's [[Deserter|desertion]], Nines confronted his former comrade at the [[Battle of Takodana]] where they fought each other in single combat. Accusing the former [[trooper]] of [[treason]], Nines gained the upper hand but was [[Death|fatally]] shot by [[Han Solo]] before he could kill FN-2187.

==Biography==
===Early life===
FN-2199 was a [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtrooper]] who served the [[First Order]] in the [[Standard decade|decades]] after the [[Galactic Civil War]]. Training in the [[FN Corps]] alongside [[FN-2000]] "Zeroes," [[FN-2003]] "Slip," and [[Finn|FN-2187]] "Eight-Seven," he took the nickname "Nines" because he liked the sound of it. They trained under [[Captain]] [[Phasma]], practicing in simulated combat for most of their lives. During their first deployment, the FN [[Corps]] was brought to the [[Pressy's Tumble refinery complex|mining facility]] in [[Pressy's Tumble]], an [[asteroid field]], and ordered to [[Death|kill]] the workers that had gone on [[Strike at Pressy's Tumble|strike]]. Initially reluctant, Nines followed as ordered once Slip and Zeroes opened [[fire]].<ref name="BTA" />

===First Order–Resistance war===
[[File:FN-2199 confronts Finn.png|thumb|left|250px|FN-2199 "Nines" confronted the traitor FN-2187 "Finn" during the Battle of Takodana.]]
During the [[Cold war|conflict]] between the First Order and the [[New Republic|Republic]]-backed [[Resistance]], [[Kylo Ren]] of the [[Knights of Ren]] sought part of a [[Map to Skywalker|map]] that led to [[Jedi Master]] [[Luke Skywalker]], who had vanished [[Standard year|years]] earlier. The map was held by [[BB-8]], an [[astromech droid]] that the First Order tracked to the [[Maz Kanata's castle|castle]] of the [[pirate]] [[Maz Kanata]] on the [[planet]] [[Takodana]]. Nines was one of the [[soldier]]s in the [[division]] that followed Ren to Takodana where he attempted to acquire the [[droid]] in the early stages of the [[First Order–Resistance war|new galactic conflict]]. By then, FN-2187 [[Deserter|defected]] from the First Order after witnessing the [[Attack on Tuanul|massacre]] of [[Tuanul]] on [[Jakku]].<ref name="Episode VII">[[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']]</ref>
