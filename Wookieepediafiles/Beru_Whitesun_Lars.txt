'''Beru Whitesun Lars''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|female]] from [[Tatooine]]. She was married to [[Owen Lars]] and raised [[Luke Skywalker]] after the [[Fall of the Republic|fall]] of the [[Galactic Republic]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
When Beru was young, [[Sexes|she]] had a [[dream]] of setting up her own cafe or [[restaurant]] in [[Anchorhead]]. She had this dream because during her school [[Standard year|years]], she entered in a cooking class, and the [[Unidentified cooking instructor|teacher]] told Beru that her [[blue-milk cheese]] was the best he had ever tasted, prompting her to have such dream as the instructor said that it appeared that she was [[Reproduction|born]] to make blue-milk cheese.<ref name="BWL:FaCPoV">{{Shortstory|story=Beru Whitesun Lars (short story)|sformatted=Beru Whitesun Lars|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>

===Before the Empire===
Beru eventually fell in love with [[Owen Lars]], son of the [[moisture farmer]] [[Cliegg Lars]], so they began dating.<ref name="Character Encyclopedia">''[[Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded]]''</ref> Shortly before the [[Battle of Geonosis|outbreak]] of the [[Clone Wars]], [[Shmi Skywalker Lars]], Owen' stepmother, was kidnapped by [[Tusken Raider]]s, an event that [[Mission to rescue Shmi Skywalker Lars|brought]] [[Anakin Skywalker]], Shmi's son, and [[Senator]] [[Padmé Amidala]], to the [[Lars moisture farm]], where they were received by Cliegg. Anakin arrived too late to save his mother, who [[Death|passed away]] in his arms, prompting him to slaughter the Tuskens. When he returned, a [[Funeral of Shmi Skywalker Lars|funeral]] was held at the farm.<ref name="Episode II">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]</ref> During the funeral, Beru served [[blue milk]] and [[cheese]] to everyone.<ref name="BWL:FaCPoV" />

[[File:Beru receives baby Luke.png|thumb|left|250px|Kenobi hands over an infant Luke to Beru.]]
Three years later, Beru had already [[Marriage|married]] Owen and taken on his last name. Both alone after Cliegg's death,<ref name="USW">''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''</ref> Owen and Beru decided to have a child, but problems of infertility precluded them to have one, leading them to consider seeing one of the [[fertility droid]]s at [[Mos Eisley]].<ref name="BWL:FaCPoV" /> When the [[The galaxy|galactic]] conflict came to a close, Beru and Owen became the guardians of their new nephew, [[Luke Skywalker]], after his father turned to the [[dark side of the Force]] and became [[Darth]] Vader and his mother died in childbirth. [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], the [[Jedi Master]] and friend of Anakin, delivered infant Luke to the Lars homestead.<ref name="Episode III">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref> After receiving Luke, Beru told Owen that they would be raising his stepbrother's son as their own.<ref name="BWL:FaCPoV" />

===Raising Skywalker===
For the next nineteen years, the Lars raised Skywalker like a son. Beru would often defend Skywalker's interests against Owen, who was overprotective of him out of fear that he would follow in Anakin's footsteps.<ref name="Episode IV" /> A year after the [[Great Drought]], Owen was kidnapped by the [[Wookiee]] [[bounty hunter]] [[Black Krrsantan]] for unpaid [[water]] taxes to [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the [[Hutt]]. Beru sought after her husband armed with a [[rifle]], telling a nine year old Luke to stay safe within the homestead.<ref name="Star Wars 20">''[[Star Wars 20: From the Journals of Old Ben Kenobi]]''</ref>

Eight years later, Kenobi, following a [[Mission to Tatooine (Imperial Era)|brief confrontation]] with the former [[Sith apprentice]] [[Maul]], visited the Lars moisture farm but watched from a distance. Kenobi heard Beru calling out to a seventeen year old Luke from within the homestead, and saw Luke running back toward the house against a binary sunset.<ref name="Twin Suns">{{Rebels|Twin Suns (episode)|Twin Suns}}</ref>

[[File:Beru at the dinner table.png|thumb|right|250px|Beru trying to convince her husband that Luke cannot stay on the farm forever.]]
By [[0 BBY]], Luke, now nineteen, wanted to explore the wider [[galaxy]], having never left [[Tatooine]]. Though Owen refused numerous [[time]]s to let Skywalker go when he wished to leave home and join the [[Imperial Academy|Academy]], Beru convinced her husband to let Skywalker go after staying on for only one more season. This decision coincided with the aftermath of the [[Battle of Scarif|theft]] of the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]] [[Death Star plans|plans]] and Darth Vader's [[Secret mission to Tatooine|capture]] of [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Organa]] over Tatooine.<ref name="Episode IV" />

===Death===
[[File:Torched homestead.png|thumb|left|250px|Beru and her husband lay dead at the hands of the Empire.]]
Around this time, Luke and Owen purchased two [[droid]]s from a [[Jawa]] [[sandcrawler]] that stopped by their homestead. These two droids were the [[protocol droid]] [[C-3PO]] and the [[astromech droid]] [[R2-D2]], who were being hunted by the Empire. Before dinner, Luke cleaned the two droids in the garage where he found a message from Princess Leia meant to be received by Obi-Wan. Luke told Beru and Owen about this recording at the dinner table which prompted discussion about the relationship between Kenobi and Luke's [[Parent|father]]. Owen also discussed Luke staying another season on the [[farm]], which Beru intervened and tried to reason with her husband that Luke shouldn't stay on the farm forever. In this conversation she likened Luke with his father, an idea that Owen was not fond of. After dinner Luke returned to the garage and found that Artoo had fled the homestead. The next morning Luke told Beru that he'd had some chores to do and went with Threepio to look for Artoo, who was secretly carrying the stolen Death Star plans. A concerned Owen could not find Luke, who was supposed to have the two droid to the south ridge by midday. He spoke to Beru about it, who told him that Luke had left early to complete some chores and that he had taken the two droids with him. While Luke was away, Beru and her husband were killed by [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] [[stormtrooper]]s searching for the droids.<ref name="Episode IV" />

===Post-mortem===
Beyond from the realm of the living, acknowledging her and his husband's deaths, Beru reflected on the role that Luke played in her life, remembering herself bustling around the kitchen serving blue milk and haggling Owen to let Luke attend the Imperial Academy. As she speculated that had Owen let Luke go, they could be still alive, Beru remembered various moments of her life, finally resting comfortably with the knowledge that Luke went off with Kenobi, met Organa, [[Battle of Yavin|destroyed]] the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]] [[battle station]] and saved the galaxy.<ref name="BWL:FaCPoV" />

===Legacy===
{{Quote|I guess it's an irony. If the boy was here when the jackboot came down, the Empire would still have a Death Star&hellip; But if the family wasn't killed, maybe he'd never have left.|Chelli Lona Aphra|Darth Vader 7: Shadows and Secrets, Part I}}
Despite the recent loss of his adoptive family, Skywalker did not grieve until soon after the battle, when his love interest, [[Nakari Kelen]], was killed on the planet [[Omereth]]. Kelen's death provided Skywalker a moment to consider his losses, and he wept upon thinking of his uncle and aunt.<ref name="Heir to the Jedi">''[[Heir to the Jedi]]''</ref> Skywalker later returned to Tatooine to recover [[The Journals of Ben Kenobi|Kenobi's journal]], which contained stories of the Jedi's few encounters with the Lars family.<ref name="Star Wars 7">''[[Star Wars 7: From the Journals of Old Ben Kenobi: The Last of His Breed]]''</ref>

In the weeks after the Battle of Yavin, Darth Vader searched for the pilot responsible for destroying the Death Star, discovering that the pilot was the son he never knew he had. Vader, accompanied by [[Doctor]] [[Chelli Lona Aphra]], revisited the abandoned homestead and followed Skywalker's trail. While assessing the destruction, Aphra speculated that Skywalker might have never left Tatooine, had his family been spared.<ref name="Darth Vader 7">''[[Darth Vader 7: Shadows and Secrets, Part I]]''</ref>

==Personality and traits==
In contrast to her husband Owen, who was mainly gruff and cranky, Beru was warm. She loved Luke and he was their son in all but name. She always spoiled Skywalker every time she had a chance.<ref name="TLJ Junior Novel">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: A Junior Novel]]''</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
{{Quote|Aunt Beru, the wife of Owen Lars, raised Luke Skywalker as her own after his mother died and father went off the deep end. She's more than an adoptive parent and a moisture farmer, she's one of the few adults who puts up with Luke's constant pining for the Academy.|[[Bonnie Burton]]|url=http://www.starwars.com/collecting/news/hasbro/f20071205/indexp4.html}}
[[File:Beru.jpg|thumb|right|Shelagh Fraser as Beru]]
The character of Beru Lars has existed in one form or another since the [[The Star Wars: Rough Draft|rough draft]] of "''The Star Wars''" in [[1974]]. In this draft, Beru and Owen Lars are anthropologists; there is also a character named "[[Clieg Whitsun]]." In the [[Adventures of the Starkiller, Episode I: The Star Wars|1975 version of the script]], the Larses own a moisture ranch, but they are the parents of Skywalker's cousin, [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia]]. In a later version of this story, Beru protects Skywalker from violent outburst by Owen. However, by an early [[1976]] version, the character is finalized and the element of the Larses being killed by Imperial stormtroopers is added.<ref name="The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film">''[[The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film]]''</ref>

British actress [[Shelagh Fraser]] was cast to play Aunt Beru in ''[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|Star Wars]]''. Fraser's first day of shooting was [[April 1]], 1976; the shots of the Lars' charred skeletons were filmed a few days prior. When post-production on the film began, sound mixer Derek Ball traveled to Fraser's house and recorded additional dialogue.<ref name="The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film" /> In the mono soundmix of the first release of ''Star Wars'', different takes for Beru's lines were used. All subsequent home video sound mixes use the same take that was used in the initial theatrical Dolby mixes.<ref>{{Cite web|publisher=in70mm.com|title=The Original First-Week Engagements Of “Star Wars”|url=http://www.in70mm.com/news/2003/star_wars/index.htm|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref>

In the [[1981]] [[National Public Radio]] [[Star Wars (radio)|''Star Wars'' radio drama]] adapted by [[Brian Daley]] and directed by [[John Madden]], Beru was voiced by [[Anne Gerety]].

[[File:BeruWhitesunLars.jpg|thumb|left|Bonnie Piesse as Beru]]
On [[July 7]], [[2000]], [[StarWars.com]] announced that sixteen-year-old Australian actress [[Bonnie Maree Piesse]] would be playing the role of a younger Beru in [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|Episode II]].<ref name="Casting">{{SWArchive|url=episode-ii/bts/production/news20000707.html|text=Casting Update: More Local Talent}}</ref> Piesse would approach Beru as being a little shy, the idea being that it was the introduction of Luke into her life that matured her.<ref name="Insider3">{{InsiderCite|58|Micro Beru}}</ref> [[George Lucas]] wanted to make sure that Beru's costume was similar to the one worn in the first film to help establish a visual connection.<ref name="Mythmaking: Behind the Scenes of Attack of the Clones">''[[Mythmaking: Behind the Scenes of Attack of the Clones]]''</ref> Her wardrobe was also partially inspired by that of Skywalker's friend Camie in ''A New Hope''.<ref name="Databank" /> The first time fans would hear the name "Beru ''Whitesun''" was in [[September]] 2000, when [[Lucasfilm Ltd.|Lucasfilm]] began registering [[Wikipedia:Domain name|domain names]] featuring names of characters and other things from the upcoming film.<ref>{{Cite web|publisher=[[TheForce.net]]|title=Lucasfilm registers new (Episode II?) domain names!|url=http://www.theforce.net/episode2/story/lucasfilm_registers_new_episode_ii_domain_names_75320.asp|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref> This same month, Piesse and the crew were filming the Tatooine scenes in [[Tunisia]].<ref name="Mythmaking: Behind the Scenes of Attack of the Clones" /> Lucas also filmed part of a scene for [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|Episode III]] in which a stand-in actor playing Obi-Wan delivers baby Luke to Owen, played by [[Joel Edgerton]]. However, this would be changed during the Episode III shoot in September [[2003]]. Lucas filmed [[Ewan McGregor]] handing the baby to Piesse, with Owen being played by a stand-in&mdash;Edgerton would be shot and added in almost a year later. Lucas made this change because he "felt it would be better if Luke were handed over to a woman."<ref name="The Making of Star Wars Revenge of the Sith">''[[The Making of Star Wars Revenge of the Sith]]''</ref>

===Deleted scenes===
At least one shot of Beru didn't make the final [[1977]] cut of ''Star Wars'': before the family dinner scene, there is a shot of Beru filling a pitcher of [[blue milk]] from a dispenser in a portion of the kitchen not visible in the film.<ref name="Lost Cut">{{InsiderCite|41|The Evolution of Star Wars: Exploring the Lost Cut}}</ref> Also, a popular production still from the film reveals that the dinner scene was shot, or at least rehearsed, with the family members sitting in different seats than in the film.<ref>{{Cite web|publisher=T-bone's Star Wars Universe|title=Life on Tatooine: The Lars Homestead|url=http://www.starwarz.com/tbone/life-on-tatooine/|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref>

A more substantial Beru scene was cut from ''Attack of the Clones'': after Anakin Skywalker returns to the farm with his mother's body, Beru helps Amidala prepare a meal, featuring blue milk, for Skywalker, having a short conversation with Amidala about Naboo and her own reluctance to travel. Nonetheless, this scene does appear in the film's [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones (novelization)|novelization]].<ref>{{Cite web|publisher=T-bone's Star Wars Universe|title=Return To Tatooine: Beru Whitesun|url=http://www.starwarz.com/tbone/return-to-tatooine/|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref> A shot of Beru and the Larses waving goodbye to Anakin and Padmé was also shot but not used in the final film.<ref name="Y'all">{{SWArchive|url=episode-ii/explore/attack/2002/07/imageattack20020723.html|text=Image Attack: Y'all Come Back Now}}</ref>
