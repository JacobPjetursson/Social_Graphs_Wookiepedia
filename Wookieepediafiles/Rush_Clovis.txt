{{Quote|You know, I spent so much of my life misunderstood. What will they say about me now? What will I have left behind?|Rush Clovis to [[Padmé Amidala]]|Crisis at the Heart}}
[[Baron]] '''Rush Clovis''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] [[Politics|politician]] from the [[planet]] [[Scipio]]. Once a member of the [[Galactic Senate]], Clovis worked closely with [[Senator]] [[Padmé Amidala]] early in her career. The two were romantically linked, until she insisted they return their relationship to a strictly professional level. With regret, Clovis respected her wishes. He continued to serve his people in the Senate, and became an influential representative of the [[InterGalactic Banking Clan]]. When the [[Clone Wars]] erupted, Clovis secretly betrayed the [[Galactic Republic]] to join the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]].

==Biography==
===Early career===
Clovis' [[Parent|father]] was an [[advisor]] to a [[Unidentified Muun banker|Muun banker]]. After his father [[Death|died]] in a [[shuttle]] accident, Clovis was adopted by the [[Muun]], who treated him as his own [[Youngling|child]].<ref name="Crisis at the Heart" /> He eventually entered [[The galaxy|galactic]] [[politics]] and became the [[Senator]] of [[Scipio]]. During his [[time]] in the [[Galactic Republic]] [[Galactic Senate|Senate]], he grew close to Senator [[Padmé Amidala]] of [[Naboo]]<ref name=":0">''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''</ref>. However, Amidala chose to end her relationship with him.<ref name="Senate Spy" />

===Clone Wars===
Senator Clovis during the [[Clone Wars]] secretly conspired with Trade Federation Senator [[Lott Dod]] and [[Geonosian]] [[Archduke]] [[Poggle the Lesser]] to rebuild a [[Geonosis primary droid foundry|droid foundry]] on [[Geonosis]] in exchange for the profits it would yield. However, the Jedi Council suspected that he was dealing with the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatists]] and asked Senator Amidala to spy on Clovis and uncover his plans.<ref name="Senate Spy" />

Clovis then met Amidala for lunch and asked her to come with him to [[Cato Neimoidia]] to speak to her diplomatic contacts among the [[Neimoidian]]s. They both went to Cato Neimoidia aboard her [[J-type Naboo star skiff|star skiff]] accompanied by Captain [[Gregar Typho]], [[R2-D2]] and [[Anakin Skywalker]] disguised as her pilot. After they landed, Clovis and Amidala were greeted by Lott Dod. Clovis showed Dod and Poggle a disk containing the coordinates to the new droid foundry. He told them that it was the largest ever built and that it would bring great profits to them; but Poggle and Dod demanded a greater share of the profits for the risks they took. He refused to comply and went to Senator Amidala. He gave her a tour, telling her of some private investments. Clovis was then embraced by Amidala who told him that she was glad to be there with him, and fainted. He realized that she had been poisoned and he confronted Dod about this, but Dod assured him that she was a Republic spy. Clovis refused to believe it, until he saw that Amidala had stolen his disk. He later confronted her, but she told him that she did it for the Republic. Skywalker came in to protect her. Clovis told him that Dod poisoned her. At first, Skywalker wanted to negotiate with Dod, but Clovis said that Dod would kill him if he found out about the disk. Clovis ultimately decided to get Amidala to her ship. However, Dod refused to let them leave. Clovis threatened to kill Dod unless he gave him the antidote. After Dod had given him the antidote, Clovis and Skywalker got Amidala to the ship. Clovis asked for the disk but Skywalker refused, leaving him behind.<ref name=":0" />

Clovis worked with Amidala again when she came to [[Scipio]] for a loan from the [[InterGalactic Banking Clan]]. He was able to convince Amidala (with the aid of [[Dooku]]) to help him in exposing the Banking Clan's corruption to the Senate.<ref>{{TCW|An Old Friend}}</ref> The [[Core Five]] were removed from power, and Clovis was selected to head the Banking Clan. <ref>{{TCW|The Rise of Clovis}}</ref> In return for his favor, Count Dooku forced Clovis to raise interest rates on Republic loans, causing outrage in the Senate. A Separatist invasion of [[Scipio]] ensued (framed as a Clovis-endorsed takeover), followed by immediate Republic retaliation led by [[Anakin Skywalker]]. During the battle, a downed Vulture droid crashed into Clovis' office containing Anakin, Padmé, and Clovis. Sliding down the rooftop, Anakin was able to catch both Rush and Padmé before falling off the edge. Anakin was only strong enough to hold one person and, recognizing this, Clovis let go of Anakin and subsequently fell to his death. <ref name="Crisis at the Heart" />
