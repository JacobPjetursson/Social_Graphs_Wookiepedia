STAR WARS
EPISODE VIII

THE LAST JEDI

The FIRST ORDER reigns.
Having decimated the peaceful
Republic, Supreme Leader Snoke
now deploys the merciless
legions to seize military
control of the galaxy.

Only General Leia Organa's
band of RESISTANCE fighters
stand against the rising
tyranny, certain that Jedi
Master Luke Skywalker will
return and restore a spark of
hope to the fight.

But the Resistance has been
exposed. As the First Order
speeds toward the rebel base,
the brave heroes mount a
desperate escape....

<poem>
Pan across the star field to reveal D'Qar. A huge Resistance cruiser vessel called the Raddus, which is named after the Mon Calamari Admiral Raddus, himself, ascends from the planet, accompanied by an escort of smaller spacecraft.

EXT. D'QAR - RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

On the planet's surface, LIEUTENANT KAYDEL KO CONNIX and her tall colleague JONES oversee the frantic evacuation of the rebel base.

JONES: We're not clear yet! There's still 30 pallets of cannon shells in C bunker.

KAYDEL KO CONNIX: Forget the ammunition, there's no time. Just get everyone on the transport. (hears a distant boom) Oh, no.

Connix and Jones look up and see two First Order Star Destroyers appear in the cloudy blue sky, quickly joined by the Star Destroyer Finalizer.

INT. STAR DESTROYER FINALIZER - BRIDGE

On board the bridge, CAPTAIN EDRISON PEAVEY of the Finalizer watches the Raddus in the distance, then turns to GENERAL ARMITAGE HUX.

PEAVEY: We've caught them in the middle of their evacuation.

ARMITAGE HUX: I have my orders from Supreme Leader Snoke himself. This is where we snuff-out the resistance once and for all. Tell Captain Canady to prime his dreadnought. Incinerate their base, destroy their transports and obliterate their fleet.

EXT. SPACE - DAY

The enormous Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought known as the Fulminatrix, owned by CAPTAIN MODEN CANADY, pops from hyperspace and into the foreground from the far reaches of space. Two massive cannons slung beneath the ship's belly begin to lower and take aim.

INT. STAR DESTROYER FINALIZER - BRIDGE PIT

In the destroyer's bridge pit, a beautiful yet stern monitor eyes a red X shape on her radar screen, her surroundings lit red for ideal visibility during battlefield conditions.

MONITOR: General, Resistance ship approaching. Launching shields in attack mode.

ARMITAGE HUX: (incredulous) A single light fighter?

EXT. SPACE - DAY

The X-wing ship faces off with the Fulminatrix. The tiny droid BB-8 occupies the tailseat with COMMANDER POE DAMERON up front.

INT. X-WING SHIP - COCKPIT

POE: Happy beeps here, buddy, come on. 

INT. RADDUS - CONTROL ROOM

GENERAL LEIA ORGANA monitors him from the control room.

POE: (over intercom) We've pulled crazier stunts than this.

LEIA: Just for the record, Commander Dameron, I'm with the droid on this one.

POE: (over intercom) Thank you for your support, General.

INT. X-WING SHIP - COCKPIT

POE: Happy beeps. Attention! (flicks a switch) This is Commander Poe Dameron of the Republic fleet, I have an urgent communique for General Hux.

INT. STAR DESTROYER FINALIZER - BRIDGE PIT

LANK PAZE: Patch him through.

ARMITAGE HUX: This is General Hux of the First Order. The Republic is no more. Your fleet are rebel scum and war criminals. Tell your precious princess there will be no terms... there will be no surrender.

POE: (over intercom) Hi, I'm holding for General Hugs.

HUX: This is Hux. You and your friends are doomed! We will wipe your filth from the galaxy.

POE: (over intercom) OK, I'll hold.

ARMITAGE HUX: Hello?

POE: (over intercom) Hello? Yup. I'm still here.

ARMITAGE HUX: (to Paze) Can you.... can he hear me?

The officer LANK PAZE nods from the bridge pit.

POE: (over intercom) Hugs?

ARMITAGE HUX: He can.

POE: (over intercom) With an 'H'. Skinny guy. Kinda pasty.

ARMITAGE HUX: I can hear you. Can you hear me?

POE: (over intercom) Look, I can't hold forever. If you reach him.... tell him Leia has an urgent message for him.

PEAVEY: I believe he's tooling with you, sir.

POE: (over intercom) About his mother.

ARMITAGE HUX: Open fire!

INT. X-WING SHIP - COCKPIT

Poe's ship's display is beeping rapidly.

POE: BB-8, punch it!

EXT. SPACE - DAY

BB-8 beeps excitedly. As the X-wing's rear nozzles fire, it hurdles forward. The velocity causes BB-8's head to slip back from his round body. 

INT. STAR DESTROYER FINALIZAR - BRIDGE

PEAVEY: He's going for the dreadnought.

ARMITAGE HUX: Ha! He's insane.

INT. X-WING SHIP - COCKPIT

POE: (grunts) Wa-hoo! That's got a kick.

EXT. SPACE - DAY

Poe's fighter soars atop of the Fulminatrix's hull, weaving and rolling throughout the aircraft's laserfire.

INT. X-WING SHIP - COCKPIT

Poe manages to fire the Fulminatrix's enemy cannons with fire of his own.

INT. STAR DESTROYER FINALIZER - BRIDGE

Hux watches with the grim expression.

INT. X-WING SHIP - COCKPIT

POE: All right, taking out the cannons now. Tallie, start your approach.

TALLIE: (over intercom) Copy that.

INT. DREADNOUGHT FULMINATRIX - BRIDGE

Hux's hologram appears.

ARMITAGE HUX: (into hologram) Captain Canady, why aren't you blasting that puny ship?

CANADY: That 'puny ship' is too small and at close range. We need to scramble our fighters! Five bloody minutes ago.

GONERIL: He'll never penetrate our armor.

CANADY: He's not trying to penetrate our armor. He's clearing out our surface cannons.

INT. X-WING SHIP - COCKPIT

POE: There's one cannon left. And here comes the parade.

EXT. SPACE - DAY

A squadron of enemy TIE fighters swoops over in pursuit. BB-8 chirps nervously.

INT. X-WING SHIP - COCKPIT

POE: Yeah, yeah, I see 'em!

EXT. SPACE - DAY

As one of the TIE ships opens fire on Poe's X-wing ship's aft, sparks fly.

INT. X-WING SHIP - COCKPIT

Poe's ship's cockpit machinery are sparking.

POE: No no. Dammit! BB-8, my weapon systems are down. We gotta take out that last cannon... or our bombers are toast. Make your magic work, buddy.

EXT. X-WING SHIP - HOLD

BB-8 drops down to a socket to a cable-filled hold. His head hovers from his body as he searches the craft compartment. Appendages on his telescoping arm plug damaged panel sections, but more begin to spark as BB-8 chirps nervously.

INT. STAR DESTROYER FULMINATRIX - BRIDGE PIT

Canady paces aboard the Fulminatrix.

CANADY: Are the auto cannons primed?

GONERIL: Primed and ready, sir.

CANADY: What are we waiting for? Fire on the base!

EXT. SPACE - DAY

The Fulminatrix's cannons unleash a barrage of laserfire.

EXT. D'QAR - RESISTANCE BASE - RESISTANCE LIFEBOAT - COCKPIT

KAYDEL KO CONNIX: Punch it!

Connix's U-55 orbital loadlifter speeds to safety, narrowly avoiding the artillery blasts which strike D'Qar's surface.

INT. RADDUS - CONTROL ROOM

KAYDEN KO CONNIX: (over intercom) The last transport is in the air, the evacuation is complete.

LEIA: You did it, Poe. Now get your squad back here so we can get out of this place.

POE: (over intercom) No, General... We can do this. We have... a chance to take down a dreadnought.

EXT. SPACE - DAY

Tailing Poe's X-wing ship through an antenna on the Fulminatrix's hull, one of the TIE fighters crashes and burns.

INT. X-WING SHIP - COCKPIT

POE: These things are fleet killers. We can't let it get away.

LEIA: (over intercom) Disengage now... Commander, that is an order...

Poe flips a switch on his cockpit's console and continues on.

INT. RADDUS - CONTROL ROOM

C-3PO the golden droid from Tatooine stands next to Leia

LEIA: Wipe that nervous expression off your face, 3PO.

C-3PO: Oh. Well, I'll certainly try, General. Nervous?

INT. X-WING SHIP - COCKPIT

A target lines up in Poe's cockpit's viewfinder.

POE: Let's go, BB-8... It's now or never!

EXT. X-WING SHIP - HOLD

BB-8 chirps as with inventiveness born of desperation, he has lowered the elevator he used to assume his station in the droid socket halfway, which requires that he erases three improper-operation alerts from the X-wing ship, and rolls into the cavity of the fuselage, as close to the short in the junction box as possible. His arm retracts into his body. Then, he uses the welding arm to swing the head out and down, like a man doffing his hat, shrieking. It smashes into the sparking junction box, primary photoreceptor swirling with electronic feedback.

INT. X-WING SHIP - COCKPIT

Poe squeezes his weapon's trigger, destroying the last cannon on the Fulminatrix's hull.

EXT. SPACE - DAY

The X-wing zooms to the fiery cloud, then banks around. Two pursuing TIE fighters collide and explode, then BB-8 pops up, crackling with energy and exclaiming softly.

INT. X-WING - COCKPIT

POE: Yeeeaaahh-ho! All clear, bring the bombs!

INT. STAR DESTROYER FULMINATRIX - BRIDGE

BASCUS: Captain... Resistance bombers approaching.

CANADY: Of course they are.

EXT. SPACE - DAY

A squad of heavy bombers and A-wing ships known as Colbrat Squadron and Blue Squadron approaches the dreadnought, resembling World War II aeroplanes, with long virtual compartments extending from their fuselages like magazines from automatic rifles. LIEUTENANT TALLISSAN LINTRA the beautiful young blonde pilot hovers on board her blue A-wing ship.

INT. A-WING SHIP - COCKPIT

TALLIE: Bombers, keep that tight formation. Fighters, protect the bombers. It's not every day we get a shot at a dreadnought, so make this count.

INT. COLBRAT HAMMER - COCKPIT

FINCH DALLOW: Copy that, Blue Leader.

INT. HEAVY BOMBER - COCKPIT

FINCH DALLOW: (over intercom) If you get us there, we'll give it to them.

PILOT: (over intercom) Copy that.

TEENE: Fighters incoming.

A squad of First Order TIE ships approach the squardon.

INT. A-WING  - COCKPIT

TALLIE: Gunners, look alive.

TIE ships fire.

PILOT 2: (over intercom) Subfighters at 2-10!

INT. X-WING - COCKPIT

PILOT 3: (over intercom) They're getting in!

PILOT 2: (over intercom) Form up!

JAYCRIS TUBBS: They are everywhere! I can't--!

EXT. SPACE - DAY

An X-wing ship with JAYCRIS TUBBS, its pilot, in it explodes into complete nothingness.

INT. TALLIE'S SHIP - COCKPIT

PILOT 4; (over intercom) Here they come.

PILOT 5: (over intercom) Incoming fighters. Form up.

PILOT 6: (over intercom) Vector at attack speed.

PILOT 5: (over intercom) Pull up!

PILOT 7: (over intercom) Flank right.

The squad comes onto heavy fire.

PILOT 8: (over intercom) Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! We're going down!
CANADY: Recharge the auto-cannons. Target their cruiser.
POE: I see it. Tallie, they have targeted the fleet and begun the priming sequence.
TALLIE: Copy that. We are almost there. Bombardiers.... begin your drop sequence.
NIX JERD: I've got a visual on the target. We are approaching the point of attack. The bombs are armed.
BASCUS: Auto cannons aimed.
GONERIL: 40 seconds to full charge.
CANADY: Destroy that last bomber!
POE: Paige, come in. We're over the target. Why aren't your bay doors open? You're the only bomber left. It's all down to you!
PAIGE: Nix!
POE: Paige! Drop the payload, now!
FINCH DALLOW: Look out!
PAIGE: No!
TALLIE: Bombs away!
RESISTANCE MONITOR: Direct hit! Dreadnought down!

MONITOR: General, Supreme Leader Snoke... is making contact from the ship.
ARMITAGE HUX: Excellent. I'll take it in my chambers.
SNOKE: General Hux.
ARMITAGE HUX: Ah, good. Supreme leade-
SNOKE: My disappointment... in your performance can not be overstated.
ARMITAGE HUX: They can't get away, Supreme Leader. We have them tied on the end of a string.

FINN: Rey!
POE: Well done, pal. "Finn naked leaking bag"? What? Did you fry a chip? Finn! Hey, buddy. It's so good to see you. What? Let's uh... We need to get you dressed. Come on. You must have a thousand questions.
FINN: Where is Rey?

REY: Master Skywalker? Master Skywalker? I'm from the Resistance. Your sister Leia sent me. We need your help. Hello?
LUKE: Go away. Chewie, what are you doing here?
REY: He said you're coming back with us.
LUKE: How did you find me?
REY: Long story we'll tell you in the Falcon.
LUKE: Falcon? Wait. Where is Han?

SNOKE: Tied to a string, indeed, General Hux. Well done. The Resistance will soon be in our grasp.
ARMITAGE HUX: Thank you, Supreme Leader.
SNOKE: Do you wonder why I keep a rabid cur... In a such a place of power? The cur's weakness, properly manipulated... Can be a sharp tool. How's your wound?
KYLO REN: It's nothing.
SNOKE: The mighty Kylo Ren. When I found you... I saw what all masters live to see. Raw, untamed power. And beyond that, something truly special. The potential of your bloodline. A new Vader. Now I fear... I was mistaken.
KYLO REN: Ive given everything I have to you To the dark side.
SNOKE: Take that ridiculous thing off. Yes, there it is. You have too much of your father's heart in you, young Solo.
KYLO REN: I killed Han Solo. When the moment came I didn't hesitate.
SNOKE: And look at you, the deed split your spirit to the bone. You were unbalanced... Bested by a girl who had never held a lightsaber! You failed! Skywalker lives. The seed of the Jedi Order lives. As long as it does... Hope lives in the galaxy. I thought you would be the one to snuff it out. Alas, you're no Vader. You're just a child... in a mask.
KYLO REN: Prepare my ship.

REY: There is no light left in Kylo Ren. He's only getting stronger. The First Order will control all the major systems within weeks. We need your help. We need the Jedi Order back. We need Luke Skywalker.
LUKE: You don't need Luke Skywalker.
REY: Did you hear a word I just said?
LUKE: You think what? I'm gonna walk out with a laser sword and face down the whole First Order? What did you think was going to happen here? Do you think that I came... To the most unfindable place in the galaxy for no reason at all? Go away.
REY: I'm not leaving without you! Careful!
LUKE: You are wasting your time. 
Who are you?
REY: I know this place.
LUKE: Built a thousand generations ago... to keep these. The original Jedi texts. Just like me, they're the last of the Jedi religion. You've seen this place. You've seen this island.
REY: Only in dreams.
LUKE: Who are you?
REY: The Resistance sent me.
LUKE: They sent you? What is special about you? Where are you from?
REY: Nowhere.
LUKE: No one's from nowhere.
REY: Jakku.
LUKE: All right, that is pretty much nowhere. Why are you here, Rey, from nowhere?
REY: The Resistance sent me. We need your help. The First Order has become unstoppable.
LUKE: Why are you here?
REY: Something inside me has always been there Then now it's awake. And I'm afraid. I do not know what it is... or what to do with it. And I need help.
LUKE: You need a teacher. I can't teach you.
REY: Why not? I've seen your daily routine. You're not busy.
LUKE: I will never train another generation of Jedi. I came to this island to die. It's time for the Jedi to end.
REY: Why? Leia sent me here with hope. If she was wrong, she deserves to know why. We all do.

LEIA: You're demoted.
POE: What? Wait! We took down a dreadnought.
LEIA: At what cost?
POE: If you start an attack, you follow through.
LEIA: Poe, get your head out of your cockpit. There are things you can not solve... By jumping into an X-wing and blowing something up! I need you to learn that.
POE: There were heroes on that mission.
LEIA: Dead heroes, No leaders.
FINN: We're really nowhere. How's Rey going to find us now? A cloaked binary beacon?
LEIA: To light her way home.
FINN: Alright, Well, until she comes back, what's the plan?
LEIA: We need to find a new base.
LARMA D'ACY: One with enough power to get a distress signal to our allies. scattered in the Outer Rim.
ACKBAR: Proximity alert!
RESISTANCE FEMALE SOLDIER: They found us.
POE: That's impossible. It's Snoke's ship. You've gotta be kidding me. Can we jump to lightspeed?
KAYDEL KO CONNIX: We have enough fuel for just one jump.
POE: Do it. We have to get out of here.
LEIA: Wait. They tracked us through lightspeed.
FINN: That's impossible.
LEIA: Yes. And they've done it.
FINN: So if we jump to lightspeed... they'll just find us again, and we'll be out of fuel. They've got us.
POE: Not yet, they don't. Permission to jump in an X-wing and blow something up?
LEIA: Permission granted. Admiral, spin us around!
ACKBAR: Reverse. Rotate the shields!
RESISTANCE MONITOR: To your stations! Move, move, move!

KYLO REN: Follow my lead.

MALE ANNOUNCER: Green squadron to launch position. Clear the launch traffic.
POE: Don't wait for me! Jump in and fire her up!
MALE ANNOUNCER: Technicians, secure supplies for launch conditions.
PILOT: Move! Move!
FINN: Poe, are you alright?
POE: We need to get outta range of those Star Destroyers.
ACKBAR: We need to what?
LEIA: Full engines ahead. Get out of range of the Star Destroyers and the fighters will fall back.
ACKBAR: All craft, full engines! Concentrate rear shields.
ARMITAGE HUX: Ren, the Resistance have pulled out of reach. We can't cover you at this distance. Return to the fleet. What is the point of all this if we can't blow up three tiny cruisers?
PEAVEY: They are faster and lighter, sir. They can't lose us but they can keep at a range where our cannons are not effective against their shields.
ARMITAGE HUX: Well, keep up the barrage. Let's at least remind them that we're still here.
PEAVEY: Very good sir.
ARMITAGE HUX: They won't last long burning fuel like this. It's just a matter of time.
POE: Move! Outta the way, everybody! Make way! Make room!
MEDIC DROID: Her vital signs are weak, but she is fighting.

LUKE: Artoo? Artoo! Yes. Yes I know. Hey, it's a sacred island, watch the language. Old friend. I wish I could make you understand. But I'm not coming back. Nothing can make me change my mind.
LEIA IN HOLOGRAM: Years ago, you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. It hurts me not to be able to fulfill my father's request in person...
LUKE: That was a cheap move.
LEIA IN HOLOGRAM: But they are attacking my ship... and I fear that my mission to bring you to Alderaan failed. It is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
LUKE: Tomorrow at dawn. Three lessons. I will teach you the ways of the Jedi... and why they need to end.

LARMA D'ACY: General Organa... Leia... is unconscious but recovering. This is the only good news I have. Admiral Ackbar... all our leadership, they're gone.
C-3PO: Oh, dear, oh, dear.
LARMA D'ACY: Leia was the sole survivor on the bridge. If she were here, she'd say save your sorrow for after the fight. And to that end... The chain of command is clear as to who should take her place. Vice Admiral Holdo... of the cruiser Ninka.
AMILYN HOLDO: Thank you, Commander. There are four hundred of us... on three ships. We're the very last of the Resistance But we're not alone. In every corner of the galaxy... the downtrodden and oppressed know our symbol... and they put their hope in it. We are the spark that will ignite the fire that will restore the Republic. That spark... this Resistance, must survive. That is our mission. Now, to your stations. And may the Force be with us.
POE: That's Admiral Holdo? Battle of Chyron Belt, Admiral Holdo? Not what I expected. Vice Admiral? Commander Dameron. With our current fuel consumption... there is a very limited amount time... That we will stay out of range of those Star Destroyers.
AMILYN HOLDO: Very kind to make me aware.
POE: Let's get me those fuel projections. And we need to shake them before we find a new base, so... What's our plan?
AMILYN HOLDO: Our plan, captain? Not commander, right? Wasn't it Leia's last official act to demote you? Because of your dreadnought plan... Where we lost our entire bombing fleet?
POE: "Captain." "Commander." You can call me whatever you like. I just want to know what's going on.
AMILYN HOLDO: Of course you do. I understand. I've dealt with plenty of trigger happy flyboys like you... You are impulsive. Dangerous. And the last thing we need right now. So stick to your post... and follow my orders.
FEMALE P.A. ANNOUNCER: Turbo-lifts seven and eight disconnected for maintenance.

ROSE: What are you doing here?
FINN: Hey, hi. Uh, I was... Uh, you know...
ROSE: You are Finn! The Finn!
FINN: The Finn?
ROSE: Sorry... I work behind pipes all day. Doing talking with the Resistance heroes is not my forte. Doing... Doing talking, yeah... I'm Rose. 
FINN: Breathe.
ROSE: OK.
FINN: Yeah, look I'm not a Resistance hero, but... It was nice talking to you, Rose. May the Force be with you.
ROSE: Wow. You too. Good. But you are a hero. You left the First Order-what you did on the Starkiller Base. When we heard about it, my sister Paige said... "Rose, that's a real hero." "Know right from wrong.... "and don't run away from when it gets hard," she said. You know... Just this morning, I had to stun... three people who were trying to jump ship. In this escape pod.
FINN: What?
ROSE: They were running away.
FINN: That's disgraceful.
ROSE: I know.
FINN: Anyway, uh... I gotta get back to what I was doing, so.
ROSE: What were you doing?
FINN: Just, just, uh checks.
ROSE: Checking the escape pods.
FINN: No, it's routine checks.
ROSE: While boarding one... with a packed bag.
FINN: Okay. Listen, I... I can't move. I can't move.
ROSE: I know.
FINN: What happened?
ROSE: I'm taking you to the bridge and turning you in for desertion.
FINN: I was not deserting. - I told you that...
ROSE: My sister just died... protecting the fleet. And you were running away.
FINN: I'm sorry. This fleet is doomed... If my friend comes back to it, she's doomed too. I've gotta get this... I've gotta get this beacon very far away from here, then she'll find me and be safe.
ROSE: You're a selfish traitor.
FINN: Look, we cannot outrun the First Order fleets.
ROSE: We can jump to light speed!
FINN: Well they can track us through lightspeed.
ROSE: They can track us through lightspeed?
FINN: Yeah. They'll just show up 30 seconds later and we'll have blown a ton of fuel. Of which, by the way, we're dangerously short on.
ROSE: They can track us through lightspeed.
FINN: Yes. And they could... I can't feel my teeth. What did you shoot me with?
ROSE: Active tracking.
FINN: What now?
ROSE: New hyperspace tracking... Hyperspace tracking is a new tactic but the principal must be the same as any active tracker.
FINN: So they're just tracking us...
ROSE: Only tracking us...
FINN AND ROSE: From the lead ship.
ROSE: But we can't get to the tracker. It is an A-class process they'll control from the main bridge.
FINN: Well, I mean, yes, but every A-class process...
FINN AND ROSE: Has a dedicated power breaker.
ROSE: But... Wait, but who knows where the breaker room is on the Star Destroyer?
FINN: I'm the guy who used to mop it. If I can get us there....
ROSE: I can shut their tracker down.

POE: Just give it to me one more time, but simpler.
FINN: So the First Order's only tracking us from one Destroyer, the main one.
POE: So we make blow that one up?
FINN: I like where you're heading, but no. They'd only start tracking us from another Destroyer.
ROSE: But if we can....
FINN: If we sneak on board the lead Destroyer and disable the tracker without them realizing, then we can...
ROSE: They won't realize if it's for one system cycle. About six minutes.
FINN: Sneak on board. Disable the tracker Our fleet escapes before they even realize.
POE: How did you two meet?
ROSE: Just luck.
POE: Yeah? Good luck?
ROSE: Not sure yet.
FINN: Poe, we've got to do this It will save the fleet and it'll save Rey.
C-3PO: If I surely must be the voice of reason... Admiral Holdo will never agree to this plan.
POE: Yeah, you're right, 3PO. It's a need-to-know plan, and she doesn't.
C-3PO: That was not exactly...
POE: All right... You guys shut down that tracker. I'll be here to jump us to lightspeed. The question is... How do we sneak the two of you onto Snoke's destroyer?
ROSE: We steal clearance codes.
FINN: No, they are Bio-Hexaencripted and rescrambled every hour. We can't get through their security shields undetected. Nobody can.

MAZ: Could I do it? Of course I could do it. But I can't do it, I'm a little tied down right now.
FINN: Maz? What is happening?
MAZ: A union dispute, you do NOT want to hear about it. But, lucky for you... There's exactly one guy I trust that can crush that kind of security! He is a master codebreaker, an ace pilot... a poet with a blaster.
C-3PO: Oh my. It seems that this codebreaker can practically do everything.
MAZ: Oh yes, he can. You will find him with a red ploom flower on his lapel... rolling on a high stakes table... in the casino... on Canto Bight.
POE: Canto Bight? - No, no. That's... Maz... Is there any way we can take care of this ourselves?
MAZ: I'm sorry, kiddo. This is rarified cracking. If you want to get on that Destroyer, I know only one option. Find the master codebreaker.

KYLO REN: You'll bring Luke Skywalker to me. You're not doing this. The effort would kill you. Can you see my surroundings?
REY: You are going to pay for what you did!
KYLO REN: I can't see yours. Just you. So no. This is something else. Luke.
LUKE: What's that about?
REY: I was cleaning my blaster. It went off.
LUKE: Let's get started.
REY: Who were those things?
LUKE: Caretakers. Island natives. They've kept up the Jedi structures since they've been built.
REY: I don't think they like me.
LUKE: I can't imagine why.
REY: Master Skywalker, we need you to bring the Jedi back because Kylo Ren is strong with the dark side of the Force. Without the Jedi, we won't stand a chance against him.
LUKE: What do you know about the Force?
REY: It's a power that Jedi have that lets them control people and make things float.
LUKE: Impressive. Every word in that sentence was wrong. Lesson one, sit here, legs crossed. The Force is not a power you have. It's not about lifting rocks. It's the energy between all things, a tension, a balance, that binds the universe together.
REY: OK. But what is it?
LUKE: Close your eyes. Breathe. Now, reach out.
REY: I feel something.
LUKE: You feel it?
REY: Yes, I feel it.
LUKE: It's the Force.
REY: Really?
LUKE: Wow, it must be really strong with you.
REY: I've never felt anythi----OW! You meant reach out like.... I'll try again.
LUKE: Breathe. Just breathe. Reach out with your feelings. What do you see?
REY: The island. Life. Death and decay, that feeds new life. Warmth. Cold. Peace. Violence.
LUKE: And between it all?
REY: Balance. And energy. A Force.
LUKE: And inside you?
REY: Inside me the same Force.
LUKE: And this is the lesson. That Force does not belong to the Jedi. To say that if the Jedi die, the light dies, is vanity. Can you feel that?
REY: There's something else beneath the island. A place. A dark place.
LUKE: Balance. Powerful light, powerful darkness.
REY: It's cold. It's calling me.
LUKE: Resist it, Rey. Rey? Rey! You went straight to the dark.
REY: That place was trying to show me something.
LUKE: It offered you something you needed. And you didn't even try to stop yourself.
REY: But I didn't see you. Nothing from you. You've closed yourself off from the Force. Of course you have.
LUKE: I've seen this raw strength only once before, in Ben Solo. It didn't scare me enough then. It does now.

AMILYN HOLDO: What was that?
KAYDEL KO CONNIX: Nothing, Admiral. Passing debris.
FINN: The fleet's only got 18 hours of fuel left. We gotta hurry.

REY: Still can't reach the Resistance? Keep at it. If you get through, check their status. And ask about Finn.
KYLO REN: Why is the Force connecting us? You and I.
REY: Murderous snake. You're too late. You lost. I found Skywalker.
KYLO REN: Did he tell you what happened? The night I destroyed his temple, did he tell you why?
REY: I know everything I need to know about you.
KYLO REN: You do? Ah, you do. You have that look in your eyes. From the forest. When you called me a monster.
REY: You are a monster.
KYLO REN: Yes, I am.

ROSE: OK. We get in, we find this codebreaker, we get out.
FINN: Do you know this town? Canto Bight?
ROSE: From stories. It's a terrible place filled with the worst people in the galaxy.
FINN: Great.
SLOWEN LO: I told those two, I said, "This is a public beach. You can't park that shuttle." But they just lit off toward the casino.
THAMM: Place your bets. Place your bets. All the bets on the table right now, right now! Place your bets here.
FINN: Aw, yes! This place is great!
ROSE: OK. Maz says that this Master Codebreaker would have a red plom bloom on his lapel. Let's find him and get out of here.
THAMM: Well played. The house wins. Where are your manners, more like?
ROSE: Come on!
FINN: We've covered this whole casino. Zero red plom blooms. Where is this guy?
ROSE: Were those what I think they are?
FINN: What are those things?
ROSE: Fathiers. I've never seen a real one.
FINN: Look, this whole place is beautiful. I mean, come on. Why do you hate it so much?
ROSE: Look closer. My sister and I grew up in a poor mining system. The First Order stripped our ore to finance its military.... then shelled us to test their weapons. They took everything we had. And who do you think these people are? There's only one business in the galaxy that'll get you this rich.
FINN: War.
ROSE: Selling weapons to the First Order. I wish I could put my fist through this whole lousy, beautiful town. Red plom bloom!
FINN: Red plom bloom!
ROSE: The Master Codebreaker!
SLOWEN LO: Yup, those are the shuttle parkers.
COP: All right, You two are under arrest for parking violation 27B/6. You have the right to remain....
LOVEY: What was that?
MASTER CODEBREAKER: No, no, no. Not now, Lovey. I'm on a roll.

LUKE: Lesson Two. Now that they're extinct, the Jedi are romanticized, defied. But if you strip away the myth and look at their deeds, the legacy of the Jedi is failure. Hypocrisy, hubris.
REY: That's not true.
LUKE: At the height of their powers, they allowed Darth Sidious to rise, create the Empire, and wipe them out. It was a Jedi Master who was responsible for the training and creation of Darth Vader.
REY: And a Jedi who saved him. Yes, the most hated man in the galaxy. But you saw that there was conflict inside him. You believed that he wasn't gone. That he could be turned.
LUKE: And I became a legend. For many years, there was balance.... and then I saw Ben. My nephew with that mighty Skywalker blood. And in my hubris, I thought I could train him, I could pass on my strengths. Han was Han about it, but Leia trusted me with her son. I took him, and a dozen students, and began a training temple. By the time I realized I was no match for the darkness rising in him, it was too late.
REY: What happened?
LUKE: I went to confront him. And he turned on me. Ben, no! He must have thought I was dead. When I came to, the temple was burning. He had vanished with a handful of my students. And slaughtered the rest. Leia blamed Snoke, but it was me. I failed. Because I was Luke Skywalker. Jedi master. A legend.
REY: The galaxy may need a legend. I need someone to show me my place in all this. And you didn't fail Kylo. Kylo failed you. I won't.

PEAVEY: The main cruiser's still keeping beyond range. But their medical frigate is out of fuel and its shields are down.
ARMITAGE HUX: The beginning of their end. Destroy it.

MEDICAL FRIGATE PILOT: The last of our crew has been evacuated and heading your way. It's been an honor, Admiral. Godspeed, Rebels!
KAYDEL KO CONNIX: Admiral, fuel reserves at six hours.
AMILYN HOLDO: Maintain our current course. Steady on.

POE: Finn, Rose, where are you guys?
COP: Deal me in. Thanks.
ROSE: Finn, the fleet is running on fumes. Without a codebreaker to break us onto Snoke's Star Destroyer.... what do we do?
FINN: I don't know. Unless you got a thief in your pocket, our plan is shot.
DJ: Um, I can do it.
ROSE: What?
FINN: What?
ROSE: What?
DJ: S-S-S-Sorry, I'm just couldn't help but overhear all the stuff that you were saying really loudly while I trying to sleep. Codebreaker? Thief? I can do it.
FINN: I'm not talking about picking pockets, OK?
DJ: Yeah. D-D-D-Don't let the wrapper fool you, friend. Me and the First Order codeage go way back. And, if the price is right, I could break you into old man S-S-S-Snoke's boudoir.
FINN: No.
ROSE: We're.... We've got it covered.
DJ: Ha-tuk-ga.
FINN: Did he just....?
ROSE: Yeah. We gotta get outta here! This way!
COP: Why, you little....
DJ: D-D-D-Did you do this?
COP: Hey, hands up! Hands up!
DJ: Yeah, man. What's your story, roundie?
COP #1: They went this way! Lock down all the exits.
COP #2: Wait.
FINN: That smells great. Those cops will be here any minute. What now? Whoa! Ooh!
ROSE: No, wait. Please stop! We're with the Resistance.
COP #1: Roger that. Checking the stables now.
COP #2: This way.
COP #3: They must have come through here.
ROSE: Hyah!
TEMIRI BLAGG - Go, go, go! Whoo!
FINN: Stop enjoying this, stop enjoying this!
SPEEDER PILOT: We've got them. They aren't going anywhere.
FINN AND ROSE: Ahhhh!
FINN: Huh?
ROSE: Move, move, move! Get outta the way!
FINN: Our ship's on the beach straight ahead! We need cover! Too much cover! There it is!
FINN AND ROSE: No!
FINN: Come on!
SPEEDER PILOT: Let the flock go. Stick with the perps. Where'd they go?
FINN: I think we lost them! Now we go down to the beach and circle back around....
ROSE: Cliff! We're trapped.
FINN: It was worth it, though. To tear up that town, make 'em hurt.
ROSE: Go. Now, it's worth it.
SPEEDER PILOT: There they are.
FINN: BB-8! Wait, are you flying that thing?
DJ: N-N-N-Need a lift?

LEIA: Luke.
LUKE: Leia.
REY: I'd rather not do this now.
KYLO REN: Yeah, me too.
REY: Why did you hate your father? Do you have something, a cowl or something you can put on? Why did you hate your father? Give me an honest answer. You had a father who loved you, he gave a damn about you.
KYLO REN: I didn't hate him.
REY: Then why?
KYLO REN: Why, what? Why, what? Say it.
REY: Why did you... Why did you kill him? I don't understand.
KYLO REN: No? Your parents threw you away like garbage.
REY: They didn't!
KYLO REN: They did. But you can't stop needing them. It's your greatest weakness. Looking for them everywhere.... in Han Solo.... now in Skywalker. Did he tell you what happened that night?
REY: Yes.
KYLO REN: No. He had sensed my power, as he senses yours. And he feared it.
REY: Liar.
KYLO REN: Let the past die. Kill it if you have to. That's the only way to become what you were meant to be.
REY: No! No!
FEMALE VOICE: Rey?
REY: I should have felt trapped or panicked. But I didn't. This didn't go on forever, I knew it was leading somewhere. And that, at the end, it would show me what I came to see.
FEMALE VOICE: Rey.
REY: Let me see them. My parents... please. I thought I'd find answers here. I was wrong. I've never felt so alone KYLO REN: You're not alone. 
REY: Neither are you. 
LUKE: Rey? 
REY: It isn't too late.
LUKE: Stop! 
REY: It is true? Did you try to murder him? 
LUKE: Leave this island now! 
REY: Stop. Stop! Did you do it? Did you create Kylo Ren? Tell me the truth. 
LUKE: I saw darkness. I'd sensed it building in him. I'd see it at moments during his training. But then I looked inside... and it was beyond what I ever imagined. Snoke had already turned his heart. He would bring destruction, and pain, and death... and the end of everything I love because of what he will become. And for the briefest moment of pure instinct... I thought I could stop it. It passed like a fleeting shadow. And I was left with shame... and with consequence. And the last thing I saw... were the eyes of a frightened boy whose master had failed him. Ben, no! 
REY: You failed him by thinking his choice was made It wasn't There is still conflict in him If he turned from the dark side, that could shift the tide. This could be how we win. 
LUKE: This is not going to go the way you think. 
REY: It is. Just now, when we touched hands... I saw his future. As solid as I'm seeing you. If I go to him, Ben Solo will turn.
LUKE: Rey... don't do this.
REY: Then he is our last hope.

LUKE: Master Yoda.
YODA: Young Skywalker.
LUKE: I'm ending all of this. The tree, the text, the Jedi. I'm going to burn it down.
YODA: Hmm. (laughs) Ah, Skywalker, missed you, have I.
LUKE: So it is time for the Jedi Order to end.
YODA: Time it is. For you to look at a pile of old books, hmmm?
LUKE: The sacred Jedi texts.
YODA: Oh. Read them, have you?
LUKE: Well, I...
YODA: Page-turners they were not. Yes, yes, yes. Wisdom they held, but that library contained nothing that the girl Rey does not already possess. Skywalker, still looking to the horizon. Never here, now, hmmm? (pokes Luke with his walking stick) The need in front of your nose. Hmmm?
LUKE: I was weak. Unwise.
YODA: Lost Ben Solo, you did. Lose Rey, we must not.
LUKE: I can't be what she needs me to be.
YODA: Heeded my words not, did you? Pass on what you have learned. Strength, mastery. But weakness, folly, falure, also. Yes, failure most of all. The greatest teacher, failure is. Luke, we are what they grow beyond. That is the true burden of all masters.

FINN: Four parsecs to go. This thing really cooks. 
ROSE: I just hope we're in time. You can actually do this, right? 
DJ: Yeah, about that... Guys, I can do it. But there exists a pre-"do it" conversation about price. 
ROSE: Once we're done, the Resistance will give you whatever you want. 
DJ: What you got deposit-wise? 
FINN: Are you kidding me? Look at us.
DJ: Is that Haysian smelt? That's something. 
FINN: No, we gave you our word. You're gonna get paid. That should be enough. 
DJ: Guys, I wanna keep helping. But no something, n-n-n-no doing. 
FINN: OK, listen here, you've gotta.... 
ROSE: Do it. 
DJ: Now I can help. 
FINN: Give it back. 
DJ: What? 
FINN: Give it back! You have no idea how much that medallion means to her. What are you.... Why are you ransacking your own ship? It's not your ship. 
DJ: He says I stole it. 
FINN: Yeah, I got that. 
DJ: We stole it. 
FINN: At least you're stealing from the bad guys and helping the good. 
DJ: Good guys, bad guys, made-up words. Let's see who formally owned this gorgeous hunk-uh. Ah, this guy was an arms dealer. Made his bank selling weapons to the bad guys. Oh.... and the good. Finn, let me learn you something big. It's all a machine, partner. Live free, don't join. 

PEAVEY: That was the last of their support ships. It's just their main cruiser now. 
ARMITAGE HUX: And their fuel reserve? 
PEAVEY: By our calculations.... critical. 

POE: She in there?
LARMA D'ACY: The Admiral's banned you from the bridge. Let's not have a scene. 
POE: No, let's. Holdo? 
LARMA: You're not allowed in here. 
HOLDO: Flyboy. 
POE: Cut it, lady. We had a fleet, now we're down to one ship, and you've told us nothing! Tell us that we have a plan! That there's hope! 
HOLDO: When I served under Leia, she would say, hope is like the sun. If you only believe in it when you can see it.... 
POE: You'll never make it through the night. 
HOLDO: Yes. 
POE: Are you fueling up the transports? You are. All of them? We're abandoning ship? Is that.... That's what you got? That's what you brought us to? Coward! Those transports ships are unarmed, unshielded. We abandon this cruiser, we're done. We don't stand a chance. No, you are not just a coward, you are a traitor. 
HOLDO: Get this man off my bridge. 

POE: Finn, Holdo's loading the crew in the shuttles. She's going to abandon ship. Where are you? 
FINN: Poe, we're on our way back to the fleet. We're so close. 
POE: Did you find the Master Codebreaker? 
FINN: We found a codebreaker. We can shut the tracker down. Just buy us a little more time. 
POE: All right, hurry. 

REY: As soon as I launch, you jump back out of range. Stay there until you get my signal for where to rendezvous. If you see Finn before I do, tell him... Yeah, perfect. Tell him that. 

DJ: Cloaking our approach. We should be off their scopes. Then we slice a slit in their shield. Blip bloppity bloop, and slip right through. 

AMILYN HOLDO: So a stormtrooper, and a who now are doing what? 
POE: They are trying to save us. This is our best chance for escape. You have to give Finn and Rose all the time that you can. 
AMILYN HOLDO: You have bet the survival of the Resistance on bad odds and put us all at risk? There's no time now. We have to get clear of the cruiser. Load the transports.
CREW MEMBER: Right away, Admiral.
POE: Yeah, I was afraid you'd say that. Vice Admiral Holdo, I am relieving you of your command for the survival of this ship, its crew, and the Resistance.
AMILYN HOLDO: I hope you understand what you're doing.
POE: Yeah. I'm going to the bridge. If they move, stun them.

OFFICER #1: ....at least three cycles so far.
OFFICER #2: Yes, sir. We're working on it.
OFFICER #3: I will do my best, sir.
FINN: Almost there.

REY: You don't have to do this. I feel the conflict in you. It's tearing you apart. Ben, when we touched hands, I saw your future. Just the shape of it, but solid and clear. You will not bow before Snoke. You will turn. I'll help you. I saw it.
KYLO REN: I saw something, too. Because of what I saw, I know when the moment comes, you'll be the one to turn. You'll stand with me. Rey, I saw who your parents are.
SNOKE: Well done, my good and faithful apprentice. My faith in you is restored. Young Rey. Welcome.

FINN: So this is it? The tracker's right behind this door.
DJ: Haysian smelt. Best conductor. And you're welcome.
ROSE: Good time to figure out how to get back to the fleet?
FINN: I know where the nearest escape pods are.
ROSE: Course you do.
POE: BB-8, tell me something good.
FINN: Poe, we're almost there. Have the cruiser prepped for lightspeed.

POE: Yeah, I'm on it pal. You just hurry. Clear the bridge, escort the officers down to the hangar.
C-3PO: Commander.... Captain Dameron, Admiral Holdo was looking for you.
POE: Yeah, we spoke.
C-3PO: Sir, I am almost afraid to ask.
POE: Good instinct, 3PO. Go with that. Seal that door!

ROSE: We're running out of time.
FINN: Come on, how's it going?
DJ: Almost there.

POE: 3PO, where do you think you're going?
C-3PO: It would be quite against my programming to be party to a mutiny.
POE: Hey!
C-3PO: It is not correct protocol. Oh! Neither is this!

POE: Finn? We're ready to make the jump.
FINN: Now or never.
DJ: Now.
FINN: You're up.
STORMTROOPER #1: You there, hands up!
STORMTROOPER #2: Watch 'em, watch 'em.
STORMTROOPER #3: Drop your weapons, now!
STORMTROOPER #4: Hands up, Rebel scum.
STORMTROOPER #3: Get down! I said, down!
PHASMA: FN-2187. So good to have you back.
POE: They didn't make it. Leia.

ANNOUNCER: Please board the transports according to your evacuation designation. All transports must be cleared....
GURNEY OPERATOR: OK, help me push him up, guys.
AMILYN HOLDO: That one's a troublemaker. I like him.
LEIA: Me, too. Now, time to board your transport.
AMILYN HOLDO: For the transports to escape, someone needs to stay behind and pilot the cruiser.
LEIA: Too many losses. I can't take anymore.
AMILYN HOLDO: Sure you can. You taught me how.
LEIA AND AMILYN HOLDO: May the Force be....
LEIA: You go on. I've said it enough.
AMILYN HOLDO: May the Force be with you always.
PILOT: Cloaking device activated. We should be off their scopes.
LARMA D'ACY: Let's hope this works.

SNOKE: Come closer, child. So much strength. Darkness rises, and light to meet it. I warned my young apprentice that as he grew stronger, his equal in the light would rise. Skywalker.... I assumed. Wrongly. Closer, I said.
REY: You underestimate Skywalker, and Ben Solo, and me. It will be your downfall.
SNOKE: Oh.... have you seen something? A weakness in my apprentice. Is that why you came? Young fool. It was I who bridged your minds. I stoked Ren's conflicted soul. I knew he was not strong enough to hide it from you. And you were not wise enough to resist the bait. And now, you will give me Skywalker. Then I will kill you with the cruelest stroke.
REY: No.
SNOKE: Yes. Give me everything.
REY: No! No! No!

POE: No. No. No, no, no!
LEIA: Poe.
POE: What is that?
LARMA D'ACY: The mineral planet, Crait. An uncharted hideout from the days of the Rebellion.
POE: That's a Rebel base?
LARMA D'ACY: Abandoned, but heavily armored with enough power to get a distress signal to our allies scattered in the Outer Rim.
LEIA: Holdo knew the First Order was tracking our big ship. They're not monitoring for little transports.
POE: So we could slip down to the surface unnoticed and hide till the First Order passes. That could work.
LEIA: She was more interested in protecting the light than she was seeming like a hero.
AMILYN HOLDO: Godspeed, Rebels.

ARMITAGE HUX: Well done, Phasma.
PHASMA: Your ship and payment, as we agreed.
ROSE: You lying snake.
DJ: We got caught, I cut a d-d-d-deal.
FINN: Wait, cut a deal with what?
FIRST ORDER OFFICER: Sir, we checked on the information from the thief. We ran a decloaking scan, and sure enough, 30 Resistance transports have just launched from the cruiser.
ARMITAGE HUX: He told us the truth. Will wonders never cease?
ROSE: No.
ARMITAGE HUX: Our weapons are ready?
FIRST ORDER OFFICER: Ready and aimed, sir.
ARMITAGE HUX: Fire at will.
FINN: Wait. No, no. No, you can't!
ROSE: No!
PILOT: Admiral, we're taking fire! Do we turn around?
AMILYN HOLDO: No, you're too far out. Full speed to planetfall. Full speed!

SNOKE: Well, well, I did not expect Skywalker to be so wise. We will give him and the Jedi Order the death he desires. After the Rebels are gone, we will go to his planet and obliterate the entire island. Such spunk. Look here now. The entire Resistance on those transports. Soon they will all be gone. For you, all is lost. Ooh. And still that fiery spit of hope. You have the spirit of a true Jedi! And because of that, you must die. My worthy apprentice, son of darkness, heir apparent to Lord Vader. Where there was conflict, I now sense resolve. Where there was weakness, strength. Complete your training, and fulfill your destiny.
KYLO REN: I know what I have to do.
REY: Ben.
SNOKE: You think you can turn him? Pathetic child. I cannot be betrayed, I cannot be beaten. I see his mind, I see his every intent. Yes. I see him turning the lightsaber to strike true. And now, foolish child, he ignites it, and kills his true enemy!

POE: Come on, give it full thrusters. Full speed!
COVA NELL: I am, sir.

FINN: You murdering bastard!
DJ: T-T-T-Take it easy, Big F. They blow you up today, you blow them up tomorrow. It's just business.
FINN: You're wrong.
DJ: Maybe.

REY: Ben! The fleet. Order them to stop firing. There's still time to save the fleet. Ben?
KYLO REN: It's time to let old things die. Snoke, Skywalker. The Sith, the Jedi, the Rebels.... let it all die. Rey. I want you to join me. We can rule together and bring a new order to the galaxy.
REY: Don't do this, Ben. Please don't go this way.
KYLO REN: No, no. You're still holding on! Let go! Do you wanna know the truth about your parents? Or have you always known? And you've just hidden it away. You know the truth. Say it. Say it.
REY: They were nobody.
KYLO REN: They were filthy junk traders who sold you off for drinking money. They're dead in a paupers' grave in the Jakku desert. You have no place in this story. You come from nothing. You're nothing. But not to me. Join me. Please.

FIRST ORDER OFFICER: Sir, the Resistance cruiser's preparing to jump to lightspeed.
ARMITAGE HUX: It's empty. They're just trying to pull our attention away. Pathetic. Keep your fire on the transports. 

PHASMA: Execution by blaster is too good for them. Let's make this hurt.
ROSE: Finn.
PHASMA: On my command.

KAYDEL KO CONNIX: She's running away.
POE: No, she isn't.

EDRISON PEAVEY: No!
ARMITAGE HUX: Fire on that cruiser!

PHASMA: Execute.

ROSE: Finn! There's a shuttle back that way! We gotta go!
PHASMA: Traitor! What?
ROSE: Finn!
PHASMA: You are a bug in the system.
FINN: Let's go, chrome-dome. Come on!
ROSE: No!
FINN: Hey.
PHASMA: You were always scum.
FINN: Rebel scum.
ROSE: Hey! Need a lift?

ARMITAGE HUX: What happened?
KYLO REN: The girl murdered Snoke. What happened?
ARMITAGE HUX: She took Snoke's escape craft.
KYLO REN: We know where she's going. Get all our forces down to that Resistance base. Let's finish this.
ARMITAGE HUX: Finish this? Who do you think you're talking to? You presumed to command my army? Our Supreme Leader is dead! We have no ruler!
KYLO REN: The Supreme Leader is dead.
ARMITAGE HUX: Long live the Supreme Leader.

LEIA: They're coming, shut the door.
RESISTANCE SOLDIER: Incoming!
POE: Go, go, move! Get that shield door down!
ROSE: No! Wait, don't shoot! It's us! No, don't shoot!
POE: Hold your fire!
FINN: Don't shoot!
POE: Hold your fire!
LEIA: Finn?
POE: Finn! Rose! You're not dead! Where's my droid? Buddy! I'm so glad to see you! Wait, what? Wait, wait, wait, slow down.
ROSE: Is this all that's left?

POE: All right, our shields are up so they can't hit us from orbit. Use whatever power we've got left to broadcast a distress signal to the Outer Rim.
LEIA: Use my personal code. If there are any allies to the Resistance, it's now or never.
POE: Rose, what do you got?
ROSE: Rotting munitions, rusted artillery, some half-gutted skim speeders.
POE: Well, let's just pray that big-ass door holds long enough for us to get help.
FINN: A battering ram cannon.
POE: A what now?
FINN: Miniaturized Death Star tech. It'll crack that door open like an egg.
ROSE: There has to be a back way out of here, right?
POE: BB-8, what do you got?
C-3PO: BB-8 has analyzed the mine's schematics. This is the only way in or out.
FINN: Come on. We have allies. People believe in Leia. They'll get our message, they'll come. But we have to buy time. We gotta take out that cannon.

SOLDIER #1: On me! On me!
SOLDIER #2: Move! Move!
RESISTANCE TROOPER: Go back! Gather your weapons!
SOLDIER: #3: Get over here!
SOLDIER #4: Hold your fire!
SALTY: Salt.
SOLDIER #5: Ground forces, incoming.
POE: Copy that, on our way.
ROSE: Engage your mono-ski. The green toggle.
POE: All right, listen up. I don't like these rust buckets and I don't like our odds, but.... what the hell? Just keep it tight and don't get drawn in too close till they roll that cannon up front. All right, ground forces, lay down some fire!

ARMITAGE HUX: 13 incoming light craft. Shall we hold until we clear them?
KYLO REN: No. The Resistance is in that mine. Push through.

POE: Fighters, break off! Come on! We gotta hold them till they pull up that cannon!
FINN: Rose, you've got 3 right behind you!
ROSE: I can't lose 'em!
FINN: Whoo! Yeah!
REY: Whoo! I like this!

KYLO REN: Blow that piece of junk out of the sky!
ARMITAGE HUX: All fighters!

REY: Chewie, pull off from the battle. Draw them away from the speeders.

POE: She drew 'em off! All of 'em!
FINN: Oh, they hate that ship!

REY: Chewie!

ROSE: There it is! That is a big gun.
FINN: OK, it's heavily armored. Our only shot is right down the throat. The cannon's opening. This is our chance.

KYLO REN: All firepower on those speeders.
ARMITAGE HUX: Concentrate all fire on the speeders!

RESISTANCE CONTROLLER: We're taking heavy losses.

POE: They're picking us all off. We're not gonna make it.
FINN: All right, making my final approach. Target in sight, guns are hot.
POE: No! Pull off!
FINN: What?
POE: The cannon is charged! It's a suicide run! All craft, pull away!
FINN: No! I'm almost there!
POE: Retreat, Finn! That's an order!
ROSE: Finn? It's too late! Don't do this!
FINN: No! I won't let them win!
ROSE: No! Finn, listen to Poe! We have to retreat!

MALE SCOUT: The cannon is warming up now.
MALE COMMANDER: Copy that. We see it.
MALE SCOUT: Preparing to fire.

POE: Move! Go, go! Quick!
SOLDIER: Let's go, let's go!
FINN: Rose? Rose? Rose? Why would you do that? Huh? I was almost there. Why would you stop me?
ROSE: I saved you, dummy. That's how we're gonna win. Not fighting what we hate, saving what we love.

KYLO REN: General Hux, advance. No quarter. No prisoners.

KAYDEL KO CONNIX: Our distress signal's been received at multiple points, but no response.
LARMA D'ACY: They've heard us, but no one's coming.
LEIA: We fought till the end. But the galaxy has lost all its hope. The spark is out. Luke. I know what you're gonna say. I changed my hair.
LUKE: It's nice that way. Leia, I'm sorry.
LEIA: I know. I know you are. I'm just glad you're here at the end.
LUKE: I came to face him, Leia. And I can't save him.
LEIA: I held out hope for so long, but I know my son is gone.
LUKE: No one's ever really gone.
C-3PO: Master Luke.

KYLO REN: Stop! I want every gun we have to fire on that man. Do it. More! More!
ARMITAGE HUX: That's enough. That's enough! Do you think you got him? Now, if we're ready to get moving, we can finish this.
SHUTTLE PILOT: Sir?
KYLO REN: Bring me down to him. Keep the door covered and don't advance until I say.
ARMITAGE HUX: Supreme Leader, don't get distracted, our goal....
SHUTTLE PILOT: Right away, sir.

FINN: Med pack! I need a med pack!
POE: She's hurt pretty bad. It's Kylo Ren. Luke's facing him alone.
FINN: Well, we should help him. Let's go.
POE: No, wait. Wait.

KYLO REN: Did you come back to say you forgive me? To save my soul?
LUKE: No.

POE: He's doing this for a reason. He's stalling so we can escape.
FINN: Escape? He's one man against an army. We have to help him, we have to fight.
POE: No, no. We are the spark that'll light the fire that will burn the First Order down. Skywalker's doing this so we can survive. There's gotta be a way out of this mine. Hell, how did he get in here?
C-3PO: Sir, it is possible that a natural unmapped opening exists. But this facility is such a maze of endless tunnels that the odds of finding an exit are 15,428....
POE: Shh. Shush. Hush. Shush up. Shut up!
C-3PO: To one.
POE: Listen.
C-3PO: My audio sensors no longer detect the....
POE: Exactly.
FINN: Where'd the crystal critters go?
POE: Follow me.
LEIA: What are you looking at me for? Follow him.

REY: If the beacon's right beneath us, they've gotta be somewhere. Keep scanning for life forms.
POE: This way.
REY: I see them! Chewie, there!
POE: No. No, no, no. No!
REY: Lifting rocks.

LUKE: I failed you, Ben. I'm sorry.
KYLO REN: I'm sure you are! The Resistance is dead. The war is over. And when I kill you, I will have killed the last Jedi.
LUKE: Amazing. Every word of what you just said was wrong. The Rebellion is reborn today. The war is just beginning. And I will not be the last Jedi.
KYLO REN: I'll destroy her, and you, and all of it.
LUKE: No. Strike me down in anger and I'll always be with you. Just like your father.
KYLO REN: No.
LUKE: See you around, kid.
KYLO REN: No!

POE: C'ai!
C-3PO: Such a friend.
LEIA: Chewie!
REY: It looks good.
KAYDEL KO CONNIX: That was crazy, man.
POE: Hi.
REY: Hi.
POE: I'm Poe.
REY: Rey.
POE: I know.
LARMA D'ACY: When we get to the Outer Rim, I have a contact there.
C-3PO: Quite definately possible.
REY: Luke is gone. I felt it. But it wasn't sadness or pain. It was peace and purpose.
LEIA: I felt it, too.
REY: How do we build a Rebellion from this?
LEIA: (puts her hand on Rey's and smiles) We have everything we need.
