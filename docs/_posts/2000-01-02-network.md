<h1> Network </h1>

We have used the Wookieepedia pages to form a directed graph. The nodes are the different characters. Links to other characters on the pages form the edges in the graph. Every node will have two attributes. Firstly, every character is a member of one or more affiliations (The Jedi Order, The Galactic Republic, etc.). We can use these affiliations to judge the __goodness__ of a character, and use this as an attribute in our graph. The goodness score spans from -3 to 4. Secondly, every character is also of a certain __race__ (e.g. Anakin is a human while Chewbakka is a Wookiee). We can set this race as an attribute as well. These attributes appear in a separate box on all the character Wookiepedia pages and is easy to extract.

Our graph consist of 407 nodes and 5086 edges. Below it is shown interactively, where you can drag the view and zoom in and out. The colors of the nodes are set according to their level of goodness. Red nodes are characters who are members of evil affiliations and green nodes are characters who are members of good affiliations. The race of the character is listed below their name.

It is interesting to see Anakin Skywalker (Darth Vader) being yellow and not red, although this makes sense when you think about it, since he was good in the first 3 movies.
<h3> Network Statistics</h3>
Let us now briefly talk about the statistics of our network. The average degree (amount of nodes a character is linked to) is 25, while the median degree is 13. This means we have a few nodes with a very high degree, and/or a lot of nodes with a very low degree, which indicates a scale-free network. We will confirm this assertion in a bit.
<br>
<br>

We can also separate the degree into _in-degree_ (links going into a node) and _out-degree_ (links going out from a node). Let us try to compare the in-degree with the out-degree for all nodes:
<img src="img/in_vs_out_deg.png" alt="In degree vs. out degree for all nodes" style="width: 100%">
<br>
We can see that the in-degree and out-degree correlates quite nicely. However, nodes with a high degree often have a higher in-degree than out-degree, where nodes with a low degree tend to have a higher out-degree than in-degree. The median in-degree is 6, while the median out-degree is 7, which also confirms this belief.

This actually makes a lot of sense. Unimportant, low-degree characters that has little screen-time in the movies, is likely to link to important high-degree characters, for instance if they appeared in the same scene, or they are from the same affiliation. It is strange, however, for important characters such as Anakin to link to irrelevant characters only seen briefly in a single scene.

Let's turn back to the discussion as to whether our network is scale-free or random. By plotting the degree distribution of our network on a log-scale, we can determine if it follows a poisson distribution or the powerlaw.

As seen from the plots, the degree distribution does not seem to follow the Poisson distribution, but instead seems to follow a straight line on the log scale. This makes it follow the powerlaw, which means it is a scale-free network.

<h3> Who is the most important characters in Star Wars? </h3>
We have now discussed some of the more general features of our network. It is time for the fun part, which is to find out who the most important characters are. To determine this, we will use four different _centrality measurements_: in-degree, out-degree, betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality. The betweenness centrality measures the degree of which nodes are placed between each other. The eigenvector centrality is based on the concept that links to important nodes should matter more than links to unimportant nodes, and thus favours nodes that link to other important nodes. The details of these two measurements can be found in the <a href="#technical">explainers notebook</a>


In the table below, we have calculated the centrality score of all the characters using all four centrality measurements. We have also included the goodness, race and community for each character. We will get to the community part in a bit, so you can ignore it for now.

<br>
From these results it is clear to see that Anakin Skywalker by far is the most important character by these measures. Darth Sidious and Obi-Wan Kenobi are the two other characters than are in top 5 for all four centrality measurements.

It is interesting to see how Luke Skywalker has the 5th highest in-degree, but only the 13th highest out-degree. This fits quite well into the story where he isolates himself, but is still talked a lot about. R2D2 is a case of almost the opposite, which also fits with the story since he can't speak and is kind of a sidekick character, although he has a lot of screen-time.
