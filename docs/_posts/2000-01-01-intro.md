Starwars is a vast universe. So vast that it has its own Wiki called <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page">Wookieepedia</a> with over 146265 pages. The purpose this project is to dive into this universe, extract the data we find relevant and provide a thorough analysis that will hopefully yield some interesting discoveries.
<br>
As an introduction to our project, feel free to check out the video below.

<p style="text-align: left;">
As our data, we decided to scrape the Wookieepedia pages of all the named characters from the canonical story, which gives a total of 407 pages.
<br>

We also decided to look at movie manuscripts and transcripts. Manuscripts contain the storyline as well as dialogue, where transcripts only contain the dialogue. We use the manuscripts for episode 1-8, and the transcripts for episode 4-6.
<br>
All this data ended up being a total of 15.75 MB.

<h3>What do we do with all this data?</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">
There are tons of things to investigate with the data we have collected. As a start, we can ask ourselves: who is the most positive or most negative character in Star Wars? Or the most positive or negative movie? Who is the most important character? Who talks the most, or is talked most about? We will answer all of these questions and many more, so keep on reading!
