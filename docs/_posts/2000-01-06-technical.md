# Technical Details

We are now through will our analysis on the Star Wars universe. We hope that we presented something interesting about Star Wars that you didn't know before.

If you want to know the technical details of our analysis, please go to our [explainers notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JacobPjetursson/Social_Graphs_Wookiepedia/blob/master/ExplainersNoteBook.ipynb). It might take a while to load, so please be patient.

If you want to play around with the data yourself, you should clone or download our [github repository](https://github.com/JacobPjetursson/Social_Graphs_Wookiepedia), where all of our data resides.
