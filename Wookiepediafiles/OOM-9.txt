{{Quote|Open fire!|OOM-9|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace}}
'''OOM-9''' was an [[OOM command battle droid]] that led the [[battle droid]] [[Trade Federation Droid Army|army]] of the [[Trade Federation]] during the [[Invasion of Naboo]].<ref name="Episode I" /> After [[Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and his [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|apprentice]] returned from [[Coruscant]] with [[Queen]] [[Padmé Amidala|Amidala]] and gained the help of the [[Gungan Grand Army]], OOM-9 was sent, with the [[Trade Federation Droid Army|Trade Federation's Droid Army]] to destroy the [[gungan]]s. He oversaw the battle while inside his own personal [[Armored Assault Tank]] and was able to create a victory for the Federation, but this was short lived, as OOM-9 and the rest of the battle droids were shut down when [[Anakin Skywalker]] destroyed the [[Lucrehulk-class Battleship|Droid Control Ship]] above [[Naboo]].
