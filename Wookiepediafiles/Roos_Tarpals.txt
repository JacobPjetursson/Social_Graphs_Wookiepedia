Roos Tarpals was a Gungan warrior who served in the [[Gungan Grand Army]] during the [[Invasion of Naboo]]. He was acquainted with [[Jar Jar Binks]], who was banished from [[Otoh Gunga]] because of his "clumsiness." During the [[Trade Federation]]'s invasion of Naboo, Binks returned with two [[Jedi]] emissaries&mdash;[[Jedi Master|Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and his [[Padawan]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]; who had come seeking help to get to the Naboo. Upon arriving, Tarpals and a colleague, who were riding [[kaadu]]s, apprehended Binks. Tarpals warned Binks that he was in "big doo-doo" this time.<ref name="Episode I" />

Tarpals brought Binks and the two Jedi visitors before [[Boss]] [[Rugor Nass|Nass]], the ruler of Otoh Gunga. Master Jinn succeeded in saving Binks from punishment by enlisting his services as a guide to bring them to [[Theed]], the capital of Naboo. Boss Nass reluctantly granted Binks clemency and sent him away. Later, Tarpals was present when the [[Monarch of Naboo|Naboo Queen]] [[Padmé Amidala]] convinced the Gungans and Naboo to put aside their differences so that they could defeat the Trade Federation invaders. As a reward for his role in bring the Gungans and Naboo together, Jar Jar Binks was promoted to the position of [[Bombad General]] in the Gungan Grand Army.<ref name="Episode I" />

During the [[Battle of Naboo|battle]] on the Grassy Plains, Tarpals served under the command of General Binks. Despite fighting bravely, the Grand Army was outnumbered and forced to retreat by the Trade Federation's droid army. During their chaotic retreat, Tarpals saved Binks from being killed by the [[OOM command battle droid|battle droid commander]] of an [[Armored Assault Tank|AAT tank]]. Shortly later, both Tarpals and Binks were captured by [[B1 battle droid|battle droids]]. However, the destruction of the orbiting [[Lucrehulk-class Battleship|Droid Control Ship]] disabled all of the battle droids; turning the tide of the battle in favor of the Gungans and their Naboo allies.<ref name="Episode I" />

===The Clone Wars===
====Battle of Mon Cala====
During the [[Clone Wars]], Roos Tarpals was present when the [[Jedi Master]] [[Yoda]] requested for assistance from the Gungan Grand Army to aid [[Mon Calamari]] forces during the [[Battle of Mon Cala]]. A Gungan detachment led by the Gungan Representative Binks fought against Separatist forces led by [[Riff Tamson]] alongside [[Clone SCUBA trooper]]s, [[Mon Calamari]], and [[Quarren]] forces<ref name"Gungan Attack">{{TCW|Gungan Attack}}</ref>

[[File:TarpalsSacrifice-SW.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Tarpals sacrifices his life to capture Grievous.]]
As the Clone Wars dragged on, tensions between the Gungans and the Naboo led the reigning [[Boss]] [[Lyonie]] to offer to aid the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] by sending the Gungan Grand Army to invade the Naboo capital of Theed. Unknown to everyone, Lyonie was being controlled through an amulet by [[Rish Loo]], one of his ministers who was secretly working for the Separatist leader [[Count]] [[Dooku]]. Senator Amidala and the [[Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker]] managed to remove the amulet from Lyonie. However, Rish Loo sent a squad of [[BX-series droid commando|BX droid commandos]] to attack them and Lyonie was wounded during the assault. With Lyonie unable to call off the attack, Binks assumed the identity of Boss Lyonie in an attempt to call off the Separatist attack.<ref name="Shadow Warrior" />

Tarpals accompanied Binks when the fake "Boss" climbed aboard the [[C-9979 landing craft|Separatist landing ship]] to help "coordinate the attack." While Binks distracted the Separatist commander [[General]] [[Grievous]], Tarpals informed Amidala of the Separatist general's presence. When Grievous realized that Binks was an impostor, he pursued the Gungan outside the ship. Tarpals and several other Gungans surrounded the cyborg general and attacked him. Soon Tarpals and Grievous were fighting each other head to head. During the skirmish, Tarpals was mortally wounded but still managed to use the last of his strength to "shock" Grievous into submission. Despite his death, Tarpals helped to defeat a Separatist plot to divide the Gungans and Naboo. However, the Naboo and Gungans were forced to release General Grievous when Count Dooku captured and threatened Skywalker's life.<ref name="Shadow Warrior" />
