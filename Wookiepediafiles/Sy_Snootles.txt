Originally from [[Lowick]],<ref name="Updated and Expanded" /> Sy Snootles was a successful singer who dated [[Ziro Desilijic Tiure/Canon|Ziro]],<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars">''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''</ref> a [[Hutt]] [[crime lord]] who represented the [[Hutt Clan]]'s business interests on the [[planet]] [[Coruscant]].<ref name="Ziro the Hutt">{{SWE|characters|zirothehutt|Ziro the Hutt|archivedate=20140427082915}}</ref> However, according to Ziro, [[Sexes|his]] nephew [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]], forced him to send Snootles away from Coruscant, and, while he promised to come back for her, he never did. A broken-[[heart]]ed Snootles<ref name="Hunt for Ziro">{{TCW|Hunt for Ziro}}</ref> then became a [[spy]] for the Hutt criminal cartels<ref name="Sy Snootles" /> and part-time [[bounty hunter]].<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" />

{{Quote|Next time you'll think twice about breaking someone's heart. Oh, wait, there won't be a next time.|Sy Snootles before killing Ziro|Hunt for Ziro}}
In the [[Standard year|year]] [[21 BBY]],<ref name="Galactic Atlas">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]''</ref> a vengeful Snootles was hired by Jabba<ref name="Sy Snootles SWE">{{SWE|characters|sysnootles|Sy Snootles|archivedate=20140222212552}}</ref> to [[Death|kill]] Ziro and retrieve his [[Holodiary/Legends|holodiary]], which contained the [[Hutt Council records]]. After entertaining the [[Grand Hutt Council]] at [[Gardulla the Hutt's Palace]] on [[Nal Hutta]] with a lavish musical number, she discovered that Ziro was incarcerated in the palace's dungeon<ref name="Hunt for Ziro" /> following his [[Senate hostage crisis|escape]] from Coruscant's [[Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center|detention center]].<ref name="Hostage Crisis">{{TCW|Hostage Crisis}}</ref> Manipulating [[Gardulla]]'s [[Gamorrean]] guards into fighting each other, the Pa'lowick slipped her way past and to her estranged lover's cell. Exploiting her affection, they share a kiss through the bars before Snootles breaks Ziro out, the two escaping through the [[swamp]]s on a [[Pongeeta-class speeder|''Pongeeta''-class speeder]].<ref name="Hunt for Ziro" />

[[File:Jabba receives the records.png|thumb|left|250px|Snootles turns over Ziro's holodiary to Jabba]]
Arriving at [[Mama]]'s [[Mama the Hutt's house|house]], Ziro convinced her to provide the pair with a [[starship]] to travel to [[Teth]], where his [[Ziro's father|father]] was [[Tomb of Ziro the Hutt's father|buried]] and his holodiary, which the Hutt planned to sell so they could retire to [[Solarine]], was hidden. After retrieving it, a vindictive Snootles turned on Ziro and shot him twice in the chest. She then took his holodiary to [[Jabba's Palace]] on [[Tatooine]], where the Hutt's nephew rewarded her handsomely for her services, while she boasted that nobody would suspect someone as "lovely" as her of being capable of doing a bounty hunter's work.<ref name="Hunt for Ziro" />

In [[20 BBY]],<ref name="Galactic Atlas" /> a very tipsy Snootles, bottle in hand, was carried out of [[Bilbousa saloon/Canon|Bilbousa saloon]] by a pair of [[Twi'lek]]s.<ref name="Friends and Enemies">{{TCW|Friends and Enemies}}</ref>

===The Max Rebo Band===

{{Quote|Whoop! Uh-oh!|Sy Snootles watches Oola fall into the rancor pit|Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi}}
In the years that followed, Snootles turned her attention to her singing career. After meeting on board a [[luxury liner]], she and fellow singer [[Greeata Jendowanian]] became good friends and formed a performing duo. Having spotted them playing in a [[cantina]], [[Max Rebo]] offered Snootles a place as lead vocalist in his [[Max Rebo Band]], which she only agrees to join on the strict condition that he also hired Jendowanian as a dancer and singer.<ref name="Updated and Expanded" /> She also becomes quite taken with fellow band member [[Droopy McCool/Canon|Snit]], whom she suggested change his name to the more palatable Droopy McCool,<ref name="Droopy McCool - Chindinkalu Flute Player">{{Topps|set=Star Wars: Card Trader|sformat=''Star Wars'': Card Trader|cardname=Droopy McCool - Chindinkalu Flute Player|link=http://starwarscardtrader.wikia.com/wiki/Droopy_McCool_-_Chindinkalu_Flute_Player}}</ref> a stage name given to him by Rebo. Her and her bandmates were outraged<ref name="Updated and Expanded" /> by Rebo's hasty decision to establish the band as a permanent attraction in Jabba's court,<ref name="Droopy McCool - Chindinkalu Flute Player" /> having immediately accepted the Hutt crime lord's offer of a contract that paid only in free meals.<ref name="Updated and Expanded" />

There,<ref name="Updated and Expanded" /> under the protection on [[Nizuc Bek]],<ref name="Force Collection">''[[Star Wars: Force Collection]]'' {{C|Card: Nizuc Bek (★★)}}</ref> Snootles worked as a double agent, feeding [[majordomo]] [[Bib Fortuna]]'s lies to Jabba's enemies.<ref name="Updated and Expanded" /> In [[0 BBY]],<ref name="Chronology note">In ''[[Bounty Hunt]]'', the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star's]] [[superlaser]] is fully operational, and ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' establishes that the events of ''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]'', and thus the completion of the [[superweapon]], take place in [[0 BBY]]. Since the Death Star was destroyed in the [[Battle of Yavin]] ([[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]), it can be assumed that the events in ''Bounty Hunt'' also take place in 0 BBY.</ref> Snootles, Rebo, and McCool were performing when [[Trandoshan]] [[bounty]] [[Bossk]] arrived at Jabba's Palace looking for [[261]], a rogue [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] [[astromech droid]].<ref name="Bounty Hunt">''[[Bounty Hunt]]''</ref> Shortly after the [[Attack on Cymoon 1|attack]] on [[Cymoon 1]] in [[0 ABY]], the trio was ordered out of Jabba's court when [[Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] arrived to negotiate with the Hutt crime lord.<ref name="Vader">''[[Darth Vader 1: Vader]]''</ref>

In [[4 ABY]],<ref name="Galactic Atlas" /> the Max Rebo Band performed at a party in Jabba's Palace. Mistaking Jabba's advances on Twi'lek dancer [[Oola]] as a request for another song, Rebo began leading the ensemble through a variation on a popular standard, though Snootles began belting out [[Jedi Rocks|improvised lyrics]].<ref name="Return of the Jedi" /> Their performance was interrupted when Oola fell down a trapdoor, where she was devoured<ref name="Return of the Jedi" /> by [[Pateesa]],<ref name="Visual Dictionary">''[[Star Wars: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> Jabba's pet [[rancor]]. Shortly after, the group witnessed the bounty hunter [[Boushh]], in reality a disguised [[Leia Organa]], enter the palace with the [[Wookiee]] [[Chewbacca]] as his prisoner. Later, Snootles watched as Jabba's guards captured Organa and [[Han Solo]] were captured from stairs<ref name="Return of the Jedi" /> that led up to the palace's guest quarters.<ref name="Return of the Jedi" /> The Max Rebo Band accompanied Jabba's entourage aboard his [[sail barge]],<ref name="Updated and Expanded" /> the ''[[Khetanna]]'',<ref name="The Khetanna (Jabba's Sail Barge)">{{Databank|the-khetanna-jabba-s-sail-barge|The Khetanna (Jabba's Sail Barge)}}</ref> to view the executions of [[Luke Skywalker]], Han Solo, and [[Chewbacca]] at the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]].<ref name="Return of the Jedi" /> Despite surviving the sail barge's [[Rescue of Han Solo|destruction]], the Max Rebo Band split up after Jabba's death. Snootles found it hard to to make it any where mainstream, chiefly because many found her vocals just too weird.<ref name="Updated and Expanded" />
