{{Quote|Oh, Ziro the Hutt, Master of the Hutt Clan on Seven Systems, I am sorry, your Highness.|KRONOS-327 addresses Ziro by his formal title|audio=ZiroTheHutt-TCWf.ogg|Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)}}
'''Ziro Desilijic Tiure''', also known as simply '''Ziro the Hutt''', was a [[Sexes/Legends|male]] oriented [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] [[Crime lord/Legends|crime lord]], a [[Vigo]] of [[Black Sun/Legends|Black Sun]], and an uncle to [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure/Legends|Jabba Desilijic Tiure]]. The son of [[Mama/Legends|"Mama" the Hutt]], Ziro was the brother of [[Jiliac Desilijic Tiron|Jiliac]], [[Pazda Desilijic Tiure|Pazda]], [[Ebor/Legends|Ebor]], and [[Zorba Desilijic Tiure]]. Ziro is one of the only Hutts that have been heard to fluently speak [[Galactic Basic Standard|Basic]] as opposed to [[Huttese/Legends|Huttese]].

During the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], Ziro arranged a deal with the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]] in a plot to gain more power amongst the Hutt clans. This plot involved the kidnapping of his own grandnephew, [[Rotta/Legends|Rotta]], who was Jabba's son. His plot was uncovered, and Ziro was [[Raid on Ziro the Hutt's Coruscant club|arrested]] by the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] and imprisoned in the [[Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center/Legends|Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center]].

Following intense debate among the Hutt Council, the renowned [[Duros/Legends|Duros]] [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]] [[Cad Bane/Legends|Cad Bane]] was hired to return him to the Council's custody, freeing him from Republic captivity following a [[Senate hostage crisis/Legends|bloody holdup]] of the [[Grand Convocation Chamber|Senate Rotunda]] and transferring him to a prison cell on [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]].

After concluding Ziro was too dangerous to the Council's operation to be left alive, Jabba the Hutt hired [[Sy Snootles/Legends|Sy Snootles]], a singer and former lover of Ziro, to secure a [[Holodiary/Legends|datapad]] containing [[Hutt Council records/Legends|sensitive information]] regarding the Council. Though he was being trailed by Cad Bane, as well as the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Quinlan Vos/Legends|Quinlan Vos]], it would be Snootles who killed Ziro with two blaster shots to the chest.

==Biography==
===Early criminal life===
Starting out as a loan shark on [[Sleheyron/Legends|Sleheyron]], Ziro moved to Coruscant to pursue a bigger career. He did, however, adopt the [[Sleheyroni tattoo|tattoos]], headdress and [[Ubrikkian tail spiral ring|jewels]] of wealthy Sleheyroni [[Hutt/Legends|Hutts]]. He eventually became a [[vigo]] of the criminal organization Black Sun, and had a [[Tattoo/Legends|tattoo]] of its symbol. He used a rundown [[Ziro's Palace/Legends|tower]] that used to belong to the [[Lantillian Spacers' Brotherhood]] as his personal base. The tower was transformed into a gaudy-looking pleasure palace.<ref name="TCW:TVG" />

When the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi Council]] was seeking information on the [[Nightsisters/Legends|Nightsisters]] after the attack on the ''[[Sedawan]]'', Ziro was held captive in his own palace by [[Asajj Ventress/Legends|Asajj Ventress]]. He was rescued by two Jedi, but was also confronted by [[Ros Lai]] at the same time, whom Ziro owed a debt. The Jedi agreed to cover Ziro's debt and give Ros Lai transport off Coruscant in exchange for a data chip containing intercepted Nightsister transmissions.<ref name="SW:TCWJA">''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Jedi Alliance]]''</ref>

At some point, Ziro began an affair with [[Sy Snootles/Legends|Sy Snootles]], the famed singer of the [[Max Rebo Band/Legends|Max Rebo Band]] who would later be his assassin.<ref name="tcwhfz" />

===Plot against Jabba===
[[File:Ziro captured.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Ziro is captured in his palace on Coruscant.]]
During the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]], Ziro ordered the murder of fellow Black Sun vigos, though his [[IG-86 sentinel droid/Legends|IG-86]] [[Assassin droid/Legends|assassin droid]], [[KRONOS-327/Legends|KRONOS-327]], failed in this task. Shortly after KRONOS-327 reported his failure, Ziro was approached by [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Padmé Amidala/Legends|Padmé Amidala]] at his palace on [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]], when she tried to reopen communications with the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutts]], as they believed that the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] had abducted Jabba's son, Rotta.<ref name="SW:TCWF" />

In reality, Ziro had struck a deal with [[Count/Legends|Count]] [[Dooku/Legends|Dooku]] to kidnap the child as part of a plot against his nephew. When the Jedi sent to retrieve Rotta died, the Order would have no choice but to bring Jabba to justice and Ziro would gain control of the Hutt Clan. He attempted to dispose of Amidala, but was ultimately [[Raid on Ziro the Hutt's Coruscant club|apprehended]] by the [[Coruscant Guard/Legends|Coruscant Guard]] led by [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] and [[CC-1010/Legends|Commander Fox]] and put into custody. Via holocomm, he was forced to confess to his nephew of his part in his grandnephew's kidnapping. Furious at his uncle's treachery, Jabba vowed to have him punished severely.<ref name="SW:TCWF" />

===Imprisonment===
{{Quote|Oh, you can't imagine the unspeakable things I've suffered. The horror! I doubt I'll ever really recover.|Ziro, after his rescue from prison|audio=ZiroSuffered.ogg|Hostage Crisis}}
Ziro's time spent in Republic captivity was supposedly a brutal time in which he suffered many horrors. Blaming Senator Amidala for his current state, Ziro hired bounty hunter [[Aurra Sing/Legends|Aurra Sing]] to eliminate Senator Amidala for revenge. Sing attempted to kill Amidala on [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]], where she was attending a conference addressing the welfare of various refugees of the war. Sing only wounded the Senator, and was captured in the act. After Sing was captured, Jedi Padawan [[Ahsoka Tano/Legends|Ahsoka Tano]] and Jedi Master Anakin Skywalker visited Ziro in his cell. He admitted to the assassination attempt, which extended his sentence in the facility.<ref name="Assassin">{{TCW|Assassin (episode)|Assassin}}</ref>

[[File:Ziro released.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Ziro gets released from prison.]]
Sometime later, Jabba and the [[Hutt Ruling Council]] conferred, discussing Ziro's importance to the Hutt's operation. It was concluded that Ziro was in possession of a highly sensitive datapad detailing the various illegal operations the Hutt Council undertook. Fearful for their safety, the Council  planned to hold the [[Grand Convocation Chamber|Senate Rotunda]] hostage with a hired gunfighter, to use it as leverage for Ziro's release.

Though the bounty hunter [[Cad Bane/Legends|Cad Bane]] intially only signed with the Council to retrieve a layout of the Senate building, Bane agreed to take part in the actual raid, assembling a team including Aurra Sing, who eluded imprisonment by the Republic in exchange for testifying against Ziro, and technician [[Robonino/Legends|Robonino]]. The ensuing raid resulted in the death of [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Philo/Legends|Philo]], as well as a number of Senate security guards.

The Hutt was released via [[Supreme Chancellor/Legends|Supreme Chancellor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine's]] orders to save the surviving Senators' lives.<ref name="Hostage Crisis">{{TCW|Hostage Crisis}}</ref> Despite being pursued across Coruscant's [[Skylane/Legends|skylanes]] by Quinlan Vos, Bane and Ziro escaped the Jedi on an airspeeder and made it to the bounty hunter's ship.<ref name="CWA: Crisis Ziro">[[Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures (video game)|''Star Wars: Clone Wars Adventures'' video game]], "Crisis Ziro" mini-game</ref>

===Ziro's assassination===
{{Quote|What a world&hellip;|Ziro's laboriously whispered last words|Hunt for Ziro}}
[[File:ZiroDead-HFZ.png|left|thumb|220px|Ziro's lifeless body after being killed by Sy Snootles.]]
After Bane successfully extracted Ziro from the prison, he was delivered to the Hutt Council on [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]], where Ziro vowed that his death would mean the leaking of the datapad to the Galactic Republic. The Hutts instead decided on keeping him under control in a prison cell.<ref name="tcwhfz" />

Jabba covertly hired Sy Snootles to release Ziro from his cell, asking her to retrieve the information in Ziro's possession and to kill him when this task was accomplished. The other members of the Hutt Council, unaware of Jabba's plan, hired Cad Bane to track down Ziro and kill him. Ziro's first instinct was to flee to his mother's house, where the Council would least expect Ziro to flee. During this surprise visit, Ziro arranged a trade with his mother for her starship, giving her his [[Pongeeta-class swamp speeder|swamp speeder]].<ref name="tcwhfz" />

Using his new starship, Ziro and Snootles traveled to Teth, where Ziro planned to retrieve his personal [[Holodiary/Legends|datapad]], deliver it to the Republic, and have the Hutt Council arrested. He showed Sy his [[Ziro Desilijic Tiure's father|father's]] grave where the [[Holodiary/Legends|holodiary]] was located. After getting her hands on this incriminating evidence, Snootles quickly revealed her assignment under Jabba, equipping a small blaster and executing Ziro with two shots to the chest.<ref name="tcwhfz" />

Around this time, the [[Jedi Council/Legends|Jedi Council]] sent [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Masters]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Quinlan Vos/Legends|Quinlan Vos]] to bring Ziro to justice. Their investigation naturally led them to the Hutt Council's stronghold on Nal Hutta, where Vos used his natural [[Psychometry/Legends|psychometry]] abilities to track Ziro to his mother's house, who then directed them to Teth. However, by the time the Jedi and Cad Bane arrived, Ziro was already dead.<ref name="tcwhfz" />

==Personality and traits==
[[File:Ziro-SWE.jpg|thumb|220px|Ziro the Hutt]]
Ziro was very flamboyant, even among the Hutts. Unlike most other Hutts, he spoke fluent Basic with a high-pitched voice and slight lisp, though he understood his native Huttese as well.<ref name="SW:TCWF" /> Like many Hutts, he was greedy and was determined to gain control of the Hutt criminal empire by any means, even if it meant blackmailing his relatives. He was also quite fashion-conscious for a Hutt, adorning himself with [[Tattoo/Legends|tattoos]] and showy [[Hat/Legends|hats]]. At some point, Ziro had cosmetic surgery to give his face a more symmetrical appearance.<ref name="Art of TCW">''[[The Art of Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]''</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
Ziro the Hutt was voiced by [[Corey Burton]] in the [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' film]]<ref name="SW:TCWF" /> and [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|television series]].<ref name="Hostage Crisis Ep Guide">{{SWArchive|url=theclonewars/guide/episode022.html|text=''The Clone Wars'' Episode Guide: Hostage Crisis|archivedate=20110630093108}}</ref>

Ziro was originally going to speak [[Huttese/Legends|Huttese]] into a microphone which would translate his speech into [[Galactic Basic Standard|English]], but this idea was dropped because the producers felt that younger audiences wouldn't be able to understand what the translator was. Later, [[George Lucas]] stepped in and specifically asked for Ziro to sound like [[Wikipedia:Truman Capote|Truman Capote]]. The character was a favorite of the production team, and they planned to have him return in the [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|TV series]].<ref name="TCW-dvd">''The Clone Wars'' DVD commentary</ref>

[[Dave Filoni]] says the topic of Ziro's sexuality is ambiguous, as Hutts are [[Sexes/Legends|hermaphrodites]].<ref name="MTV">{{Cite_web|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/08/12/is-zero-the-hutt-the-first-gay-alien-in-star-wars-history/|title=Is Ziro The Hutt The First Gay Alien In Star Wars History?|accessdate=2008-08-18|author=Shawn Adler|date=August 12, 2008|publisher=MTV|archiveurl=https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20080828035308/http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/08/12/is-ziro-the-hutt-the-first-gay-alien-in-star-wars-history/|archivedate=2008-08-28}}</ref> Ziro's final chronological appearance in the episode "[[Hunt for Ziro]]" established his interest in females.<ref name="tcwhfz" />

The young reader book [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Watch out for Jabba the Hutt!|''Watch Out for Jabba the Hutt!'']] mistakenly identifies Ziro as Jabba's nephew, instead of his uncle.

The only Ziro toy available was released in 2012, he was included in a ''Fighter Pods'' set from Hasbro and exclusive to the Target shops.<ref name="GalacticHunter">{{Cite_web|url=http://www.galactichunter.com/gh/story/video-review-target-exclusive-special-edition-darth-maul-tin-fighter-pods-set|title=Video Review: Target Exclusive Special Edition Darth Maul Tin Fighter Pods Set|accessdate=2015-11-17|author=Adam Pawlus|date=November 5, 2012|publisher=Galactic Hunter}}</ref> The character was also featured in the ''Marbs Series'' by [[Wikipedia:Jakks Pacific|Jakks Pacific]].<ref name="MightyJabba'sCollection">{{Cite_web|url=http://mightyjabba.com/2010/02/25/clone-wars-ziro-the-hutt-marb-marble/|title=Clone Wars Ziro the Hutt Marb (Marble)|accessdate=2015-11-17|date=February25, 2010|publisher=Mighty Jabba's Collection}}</ref>
