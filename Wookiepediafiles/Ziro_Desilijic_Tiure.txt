{{Quote|Oh, Ziro the Hutt, Master of the Hutt Clan on Seven Systems, I am sorry, your Highness.|[[KRONOS-327]] addresses Ziro by his formal title|audio=ZiroTheHutt-TCWf.ogg|Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)}}
'''Ziro Desilijic Tiure''', also known as '''Ziro the Hutt''', was a [[Hutt]] [[Sexes|male]] [[crime lord]] who controlled seven [[star system]]s in the name of the [[Hutt Clan]] during the [[Fall of the Republic|decline]] of the [[Galactic Republic]]. A [[Homeworld|native]] of the [[planet]] [[Sleheyron]], Ziro eventually left [[Hutt Space]] in favor of [[the galaxy]]'s [[Core Worlds]] and established his [[Ziro's Palace|residence]] on [[Coruscant]], the [[Galaxy|galactic]] [[capital]] of the Republic. In addition to his [[Ziro's father|father]] and [[Mama|mother]], Ziro's family included [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]], his nephew who [[Parent|fathered]] the Huttlet heir [[Rotta]]. [[Gorga Desilijic Aarrpo]] was another influential relative of Ziro, serving as a member of the [[Grand Hutt Council]].

In the [[Standard year|year]] [[22 BBY]], Ziro formed a secret pact with [[Count]] [[Dooku]]&mdash;the [[Head of State|leader]] of the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]]&mdash;during the early [[Standard day|days]] of the [[Clone Wars]]. With the help of the Separatists, Ziro had his great-nephew Rotta abducted and taken to a [[B'omarr Order Monastery|B'omarr monastery]] on the [[Wild Space|distant]] world of [[Teth]]. Knowing the [[Jedi Order]] would send their own to rescue the Huttlet, Ziro hoped that the [[death]]s of Rotta's would-be [[Jedi]] saviors would lead to a conflict between Jabba and the Republic. With Jabba removed from power, Ziro would be in a position to seize control of their clan.

Ziro's role in the conspiracy was discovered by [[Senator]] [[Padmé Amidala]], who confronted the gangster in his nightclub on Coruscant during the [[Battle of Teth|mission to rescue Rotta]]. With Rotta safely returned to his father on [[Tatooine]], Ziro was taken into custody by the [[Coruscant Guard]]. However, as the war progressed, the Grand Hutt Council regarded Ziro as too dangerous to be left in a Republic [[prison]], given his knowledge of their inner workings. As a result, the Hutts recruited the [[bounty hunter]] [[Cad Bane]], who [[Senate hostage crisis|freed]] Ziro and turned him over to the Hutt Council. Although Ziro escaped the Hutts as well, he was ultimately [[Showdown on Teth|murdered]] in [[21 BBY]] by the [[alien]] [[Musician|singer]] [[Sy Snootles]], Ziro's one-[[time]] lover whom Jabba hired to kill his uncle and retrieve the [[Hutt Council records]].

==Biography==
At some point, Ziro was born to [[Mama]] the Hutt and had a brother named [[Ebor]]. He then had an affair with [[Sy Snootles]], one of his nephew [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba's]] dancers. However, Ziro ended the affair<ref name="HfZ" /> and went to [[Coruscant]]. There, he operated a [[Ziro's Palace|nightclub]].<ref name="TCWFilm" />

===Clone Wars===
[[File:Ziro the Hutt.png|thumb|left|300px|Ziro conspiring with Count Dooku]]
During the [[Clone Wars]], Ziro made a deal with [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist]] leader [[Count]] [[Dooku]]; Dooku's assassin, [[Asajj Ventress]], would kidnap his nephew [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba's]] son, [[Rotta]]. However, Ziro then learned from [[Naboo]] Senator [[Padmé Amidala]] that the Jedi had rescued Jabba's son. Fearing that his role would be discovered, Ziro contacted Dooku, informing him of Amidala's investigation. Dooku assured Ziro that Jabba believed him about the Jedi killing his son. Knowing Jabba would execute the Jedi responsible, Dooku assured Ziro that he would become master of all the Hutt Clans when the Jedi would bring Jabba to justice. Ziro was then ordered by Dooku to eliminate Amidala if she continued investigating.<ref name="TCWFilm" />
[[File:Ziro captured.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Coruscant Guard arrested Ziro on charges of abduction and imprisoning a senator of the Republic.]]
Ziro and his [[IG-86 sentinel droid]]s then found Amidala. When Dooku realized that it was Amidala, he told Ziro that his allies would pay him for delivering Amidala to him. Ziro, agreeing to the deal, had Amidala placed in his dungeon and thanked Dooku for the profitable alliance. However, Ziro learned that Amidala had contacted her [[protocol droid]], [[C-3PO]], for help. Thus, he decided to execute Amidala, knowing his powerful friends in the [[Galactic Senate|Republic Senate]] would protect him. Ziro and droids were then attacked by Commander [[CC-1010|Fox]] and his detachment of the [[Coruscant Guard]] that 3PO called. Ziro was then held at gunpoint by Amidala. Ziro tried to plead innocence to no avail to Amidala. Ziro contacted Jabba on Tatooine, and Amidala informed Jabba that Ziro was behind Rotta's kidnapping. Ziro also confessed that Dooku also helped in the kidnapping. Jabba vowed that Ziro would be severely punished.<ref name="TCWFilm" />

====Imprisonment====
{{Quote|Oh, you can't imagine the unspeakable things I've suffered. The horror! I doubt I'll ever really recover.|Ziro, after his rescue from prison|audio=ZiroSuffered.ogg|Hostage Crisis}}
Ziro was imprisoned in the [[Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center|Judiciary Central Detention Center]]. Desiring revenge on Amidala, Ziro able to hire bounty hunter [[Aurra Sing]] to kill her. When Sing failed, Ziro spoke with [[Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker]] and his [[Padawan]] [[Ahsoka Tano]]. When Tano told Ziro that Sing revealed that he paid her, Ziro confessed to hiring her. However, Tano tricked him and his sentence was increased.<ref name="Assassin" />

[[File:Bane & Ziro.jpeg|thumb|left|241x241px|Cad Bane and Ziro]]
During this time, Jabba and the [[Grand Hutt Council|Hutt Council]], knew that it was only a matter of time before Ziro would give the Republic Senate the [[Hutt Council records|Council's records]]. Thus, the council decided to hire [[Cad Bane]] to [[Senate hostage crisis|free]] Ziro.<ref name="Evil Plans">{{TCW|Evil Plans}}</ref> Bane and his [[Cad Bane's group|team]] were able to hold several members of the Republic senate hostage, and force Chancellor Palpatine to release Ziro. Ziro was brought out when Senator [[Orn Free Taa]] arrived and gave the Detention Center's guards a [[pardon disc]]. Ziro then boarded [[HELIOS-3D]]'s speeder and took Ziro to the [[Senate Building]] despite his objections. [[HELIOS-3D]] and Ziro then pickup-ed Bane's team. After Bane and his group boarded the speeder, Ziro told Bane about his captivity in the detention center and approved of Bane killing off the senators. Ziro congratulated Bane on freeing him, but Bane reminded him that he expected to be paid.<ref name="Hostage Crisis">{{TCW|Hostage Crisis}}</ref>
====Ziro's death====
{{Quote|What a world…|Ziro's last words|Hunt for Ziro}}
Ziro was taken to [[Nal Hutta]] where he spoke with [[Gardulla]] and the Hutt Council. Despite thanking them for his escape from Republic captivity, Ziro knew they did not want him to reveal the location of the Council's records. He threatened to have the records dropped off at the Republic senate should he be killed. Thus, the Council kept Ziro locked up in a prison cell. Ziro was able to escape with help from his former girl friend [[Sy Snootles]]. Ziro and Nootles were able to make their escape by stealing a [[Pongeeta-class speeder|speeder]] and went to [[Mama]]'s [[Mama the Hutt's house|house]]. Ziro was able to convince his mother to give Ziro her ship in order to go to Teth.
[[File:ZiroDead-HFZ.png|thumb|300px|Ziro left for dead on Teth.]]
On Teth, Ziro went to his [[Ziro's father|father's]] grave, where the council records were hidden. However, Snootles had secretly been hired by Jabba to retrieve the records. Snootles then shot Ziro and left his body to be found by both the Jedi and Bane.<ref name="HfZ" />

==Behind the scenes==
Ziro the Hutt first appeared in the [[2008]] [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'']] animated film, voiced by prolific voice actor [[Corey Burton]].<ref name="TCWFilm" /> Burton went on to reprise the role in four more episodes of the ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]''.

Though so far the only Hutt who speaks [[Galactic Basic]] onscreen, this was not originally intended. Ziro was meant to speak [[Huttese]] into a microphone which would translate his speech into English, but this idea was dropped when the producers felt that younger audiences wouldn't understand what the translator was. Later, [[George Lucas]] stepped in and specifically asked for Ziro to sound like [[Wikipedia:Truman Capote|Truman Capote]]. The character was a favorite of the production team, and they planned to have him return in the subsequent ''The Clone Wars'' series.<ref name="TCW-dvd">[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star wars: The Clone Wars'' film]] DVD commentary</ref>

Following the release of ''The Clone Wars'' film, [[Dave Filoni]] commented during an interview with MTV News that Ziro's sexuality was "ambiguous," leading media to speculate whether Ziro was the first LGBT alien in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise. Filoni stated, however, that Ziro was biologically asexual.<ref name="MTV News">{{Cite_web|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/08/12/is-zero-the-hutt-the-first-gay-alien-in-star-wars-history/|title=Is Ziro The Hutt The First Gay Alien In Star Wars History?|accessdate=2008-08-18|author=Shawn Adler|date=August 12, 2008|publisher=MTV|archiveurl=https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20080828035308/http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/08/12/is-ziro-the-hutt-the-first-gay-alien-in-star-wars-history/|archivedate=2008-08-28}}</ref>
