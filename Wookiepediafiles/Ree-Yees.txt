'''Ree-Yees'''<ref name="AEYNTK" /> was a [[Gran]] who worked for the [[Hutt]] [[crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]]. The Gran's role in [[Jabba's Palace]] on the [[planet]] [[Tatooine]] was to care for the Hutt's pet [[Frog-dog]] [[Buboicullaar]]. Ree-Yees despised the Hutt employer, but not as much as Buboicullaar&mdash;who was in fact [[Sentience|sentient]]&mdash;hated Ree-Yees.<ref name="AEYNTK" /> When the [[Jedi Knight]] [[Luke Skywalker]] was dropped into Jabba's [[rancor]]<ref name="ROTJ" /> [[Pateesa]]'s,<ref name="LD">''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]''</ref> pit to be eaten, Ree-Yees was amongst those who crowded round to watch the battle and cheer on the rancor. The Gran later rode on board Jabba's [[sail barge]] ''[[Khetanna]]'' to the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]], where Skywalker was to be fed to a [[sarlacc]] alongside the [[smuggler]]s [[Han Solo]] and [[Chewbacca]]. Skywalker and his companions managed to break free during the execution attempt, [[Death|killing]] Jabba and destroying the barge and Ree-Yees along with it.<ref name="ROTJ" />

==Behind the scenes==
Ree-Yees was originally set to be the character of [[Gial Ackbar]] in the [[1983]] film [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']], however after reviewing sculpts the filmmakers decided to go with the familiar fishy-looking Ackbar instead.<ref name="Much to Learn">{{SW|url=news/much-to-learn-you-still-have-10-things-you-might-not-know-about-mon-calamari|text=Much to Learn You Still Have: 10 Things You Might Not Know about the Mon Calamari}}</ref>
