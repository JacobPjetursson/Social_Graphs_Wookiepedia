{{Quote|For the Republic! For the Twi'leks!|Ima-Gun Di, leading his troops into Battle on Ryloth|Supply Lines}}
'''Ima-Gun Di''' was a [[Sexes|male]] [[Kajain'sa'Nikto]] [[Jedi Master]] who served the [[Jedi Order]] as a [[Jedi General|General]] during the [[Clone Wars]]. He was killed on [[Ryloth]] helping to save its people.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Ima-Gun Di was a [[Force-sensitive]] [[Kajain'sa'Nikto]] [[Sexes|male]] who was taken in by the [[Jedi Order]] and trained to become a [[Jedi]].

===The Clone Wars===
====Battle of Ryloth====
{{Quote|Admiral Dao, this is General Di. We're in trouble down here. Our forces need those supplies immediately."<br />"I understand General, but I am in no position to help. We are critically low on fuel and ammunition.|Di asks Admiral Dao for aid|Supply Lines}}
[[File:Ima-Gun Di and Cham Syndulla.png|thumb|250px|left|Di fights alongside Twi'lek freedom fighter, Cham Syndulla, during the Battle of Ryloth.]]
During the early stages of the [[Clone Wars]] between the [[Galactic Republic]] and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]], Di held the rank of [[Jedi Master]] and was sent to the [[planet]] [[Ryloth]] with a [[Outer Rim garrison|detachment]] of [[clone trooper]]s to help defend the native [[Twi'lek]] population against a full scale [[Battle of Ryloth|Separatist invasion]]. The Republic forces fought valiantly alongside the [[Twi'lek Resistance]]; however, the Separatists were able to create a blockade around the world which prevented any supplies or reinforcements being delivered to Di and his men or the natives.<ref name="SL" />

During heavy fighting, [[Cham Syndulla]], leader of the Twi'lek Resistance, approached Di and [[Clone Captain]] [[Keeli]] and informed the Jedi that their forces' food and energy supplies were running low. Di contacted Republic [[Admiral]] [[Dao]], whose [[Venator-class Star Destroyer|''Venator''-class Star Destroyer]] still remained in orbit, and requested that supplies be delivered as quickly as possible. Dao was unable to help, as his ship was low on fuel as well as ammunition and so instead he contacted the [[Jedi High Council]] to request aid. During the [[Hologram|holographic]] transmission with the council, Dao's vessel was destroyed, leaving Di's forces without any support in the space above Ryloth .<ref name="SL" />

[[File:Ima-Gun Di for the Republic.png|right|thumb|250px|Di sounds the final charge against the Separatist forces on Ryloth.]]
Seemingly alone, the Twi'leks and clones under Di's command were slowly pushed back by the Separatist forces, and their right flank soon collapsed, leaving the Separatists to close in on the Jedi's location. Despite spotty communications, Di promised Syndulla that the Republic would come through with reinforcements, but the Twi'lek was unconvinced and believing that the Separatists would soon overrun them ordered his people to leave. Keeli explained to Syndulla that without the right flank all of them were trapped and could not escape, and so would have to continue fighting the Separatists together.<ref name="SL" />

The Twi'leks still began preparing to evacuate, but soon realized that the single [[Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry]] that the Republic forces had left was not enough to carry them and their families. Di then created an alternate plan, in which the [[transport]] would be used as a [[Bomb/Legends|bomb]] after its fuel systems were reconfigured. If the explosion was used to collapse one of the two routes leading to their position it would force the Separatists to confront them in the other, a narrow ravine. He explained that while the Republic held the ravine, the Twi'leks could escape by foot over the mountains. Keeli praised the plan and then informed the troops of their orders.<ref name="SL" />

[[File:Di Keeli Ryloth.png|thumb|left|250px|Di and Captain Keeli stand off against the Separatist forces.]]
As the troops prepared for battle, Syndulla's subordinate [[Gobi Glie]] approached Di and informed him that Syndulla was still angry at being let down by the Republic. Di expressed his sympathies and told Glie to pass them on, warning that the Twi'leks would need to be quick, as he and the clones could only hold out for so long. He then ordered Keeli to check the transport was ready and prepared to engage the approaching Separatists. The LAAT/I's destruction successfully destroyed the pass, and so the Separatists moved to confront Di and his men in the ravine as planned.<ref name="SL" />

===Sacrifice===
{{Quote|The Twi'leks... will live to fight another day!|Master Di's last words|Supply Lines}}
As the Twi'leks fled, Di led his troops in battle at the ravine, deflecting many [[blaster]] bolts with his [[lightsaber]] as the Republic forces held their ground. The clones quickly began taking heavy casualties and Keeli was downed by the explosion of a [[thermal detonator]]. Believing his friend to be dead, Di moved to fight the huge Separatist force alone, but was surprised when Keeli got up and kept fighting. The pair then fought back to back, holding out as long as possible but were soon overwhelmed by fire.<ref name="SL" />

[[File:LastStandOfImaGunDi-SL.png|thumb|250px|right|Di, moments before his death, stands off against the Separatist forces on the battlefield alone, waiting for the supplies to arrive.]]
Keeli died first, after which Di received word from a group of three [[Pelta-class frigate|''Pelta''-class frigates]] that they had broken through the blockade and were en route to deliver supplies to the Twi'leks. Gladdened by the knowledge that the Twi'leks would live to fight another day, Di deflected several more bolts back at his attackers, but then took multiple shots to the torso, killing him. The Battle of Ryloth would continue long after the Jedi Master's death, but would eventually end with a Republic victory, partly thanks to Di's sacrifice.<ref name="SL" />

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Cham is still angry. He feels betrayed."<br />"We counted on Republic assistance, and it didn't come. War turns promises into hopes. I wish it were not so.|Di expresses regret over the Republic's failure to provide aid after learning of Syndulla’s anger from Glie|Supply Lines}}
Di was a Kajain'sa'Nikto male with [[Color|orange]] skin and blue [[eye]]s. During the Battle of Ryloth, he had full faith in the Republic, believing that they would deliver reinforcements and aid even without any communications to confirm it. When they did not, he understood the anger of Syndulla. He was willing to sacrifice himself and his clone troopers in order to allow the Twi'lek Resistance and their families to escape. In his last moments, Di and Keeli held out alone, trying to make their last moments memorable ones. The Jedi was greatly pleased to hear that supplies had arrived, dying in the knowledge that his sacrifice to save the Twi'leks had not been in vain.<ref name="SL" />

==Equipment==
While fighting on Ryloth, Di wore brown Jedi robes with white armored gauntlets that included a communicator. He used a blue-bladed lightsaber in combat.<ref name="SL" />

==Behind the scenes==
In the [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|''Star Wars'': ''The Clone Wars'']] TV series, Master Di was voiced by [[Robin Atkin Downes]], who also voiced [[Cham Syndulla]] in the same episode.
