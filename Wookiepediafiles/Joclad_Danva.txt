{{Quote|The art of Teräs Käsi is about control and mastery of one's self.|Joclad Danva|Threats of the Galaxy}}
'''Joclad Danva''' was a [[Sexes/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] serving the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] and the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] during the final years of the [[Republic Classic era]]. A master of the fighting technique called [[Teräs Käsi/Legends|Teräs Käsi]], Danva fought and died in the opening [[First Battle of Geonosis|battle]] of the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]].

==Biography==
Discovered to be [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] early in his childhood, Danva was taken to the [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] [[Jedi Temple]] for [[Jedi training/Legends|training]] in the ways of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]]. Eventually [[Jedi Initiate Trials|graduating]] from the [[Jedi academy|academy]] there, Danva was selected by a [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] to become a [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] and travel [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] studying the ways of the Jedi through active duty. Eventually passing his [[Jedi Trials/Legends|Trials of Knighthood]], Danva was [[Knighting ceremony/Legends|knighted]] and began his independent studies down the path of the [[Jedi Guardian]]. This further research led him to become a master of the martial arts form known as [[Teräs Käsi/Legends|Teräs Käsi]], a highly physical form of fighting.<ref name="MSI" /> Combining this with his prowess in [[Form VI/Legends|Form VI]] of [[Lightsaber combat/Legends|lightsaber combat]], Danva was a formidable opponent in a fight.<ref name="Fightsaber" />

Often traveling to [[Bunduki]] to participate in the Teräs Käsi matches held there annually, Danva refrained from using the Force against his opponents as he believed that gave him an unfair advantage. During the [[22 BBY/Legends|22 BBY]] match between Danva and non-Force-sensitive [[Phow Ji]], Danva was outmatched and defeated by Ji, who took the victory as proof that the Force did not exist.<ref name="MSI" /><ref name="Jedi Defeated">{{Hnn|55|sports/1359_1.html|Jedi Defeated for Teräs Käsi Title|https://web.archive.org/web/20130728114819/http://www.holonetnews.com/55/sports/1359_1.html}}</ref> Returning to the Jedi Temple after the competition, Danva was summoned by [[Master of the Order/Legends|Master of the Order]] [[Mace Windu/Legends|Mace Windu]] to join a massive [[Geonosis strike team|Jedi strike team]] that was headed for [[Geonosis/Legends|Geonosis]]. Joining his fellow Jedi, Danva flew out to Geonosis and set his [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] down in the dusty plains of the world, before marching into the [[Petranaki arena/Legends|Petranaki arena]] where Jedi [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]], and [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Padmé Amidala/Legends|Padmé Amidala]] were being prepared for execution by the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. Following Windu's cue, Danva and the other Jedi spread throughout the arena ignited their [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsabers]] and began cutting down the hordes of [[B1 battle droid/Legends|battle droids]] filling the arena. After a great battle on the arena floor, Danva and the twenty-some Jedi left standing received an ultimatum from Confederacy leader [[Count/Legends|Count]] [[Dooku/Legends|Dooku]]: surrender and join him, or die. Choosing to take their chances with the battle droids, the Jedi prepared to fight to the death when [[Grand Master/Legends|Grand Master]] [[Yoda/Legends|Yoda]] arrived with the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army of the Republic]]. Danva however, did not survive the ensuing battle.<ref name="Fightsaber" />
