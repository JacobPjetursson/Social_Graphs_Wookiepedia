'''IG-88''', also known as a '''Phlutdroid''', was a rogue, deadly [[Sexes|masculine]] [[IG-series]] [[assassin droid]] manufactured by [[Holowan Laboratories]] who worked as a [[bounty hunter]]. Following the [[Battle of Hoth]], he and several other bounty hunters were summoned by [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] to the ''[[Executor]]'' and hired to track down the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' and her [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel]] crew. Unable to track his quarry, IG-88 trailed his chief rival, [[Boba Fett]], to [[Bespin]], where the bounty hunter destroyed the assassin droid. However, IG-88 managed to survive the defeat, and he later worked with [[mercenary]] [[Bazine Netal]].

[[File:Kallus & IG-88.jpg|left|thumb|200px|IG-88 with Agent Kallus]]
During the [[Imperial Era|Age of the Empire]], IG-88 was hired by [[Imperial Security Bureau]] Agent [[Alexsandr Kallus]] to assist in tracking down [[Imperial Army]] deserter turned smuggler, Captain [[Han Solo]] of the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''.<ref name="Spy Games" />

Later, IG-88 teamed up with [[Hondo Ohnaka]] to collect the [[bounty]] on [[Crimson Dawn]] [[lieutenant]] [[Qi'ra|Qi'ra's]] head. Tracking Qi'ra down, IG-88 and Hondo managed to apprehend Qi'ra. Turning the bounty hunter and the [[pirate]] against each other, Qi'ra convinced IG-88 to collect the bounty on Hondo instead of the bounty on her. Attacking Hondo, IG-88 was quickly [[stun]]ned and put in [[Stuncuffs|binders]]. After Qi'ra had similarly tricked and apprehended Hondo, IG-88 was led away by Qi'ra so that she could collect the bounty on his head.<ref name="Triplecross">{{FOD|Triplecross}}</ref>

Later, IG-88 [[Mission to Garel|pursued]] [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Organa]] on [[Garel]], seeking a [[data-tape]] in her possession of [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] base locations. Organa was assisted by [[Sabine Wren]], who identified the droid, and the pair fled as the assassin opened fire in the corridors of [[Garel City Spaceport]]. However, Wren planted a [[paint bomb]], surprising IG-88 and covering him in purple paint. Leia convinced several [[stormtrooper]]s to fire at the bounty hunter, and the droid was hit by a blast before retreating.<ref name="Bounty of Trouble">{{FOD|Bounty of Trouble}}</ref>

[[File:BountyHunters.jpg|thumb|200px|IG-88 and his fellow bounty hunters are briefed by Darth Vader on the ''Executor''{{'s}} bridge]]
By the [[Standard year|year]] [[0 ABY]], IG-88 consorted with the [[crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]]. He was present in the [[Hutt]]'s [[Jabba's Palace|palace]] while Jabba received [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]].

==Behind the scenes==
{{Quote|IG-88 was never going to be more than a filler for the now infamous bounty hunter Lineup. I decided we needed a real dirty, evil, and vicious bot. Like the bounty hunters of old. Lots of weapons and protection. Dark and oily. So we made him big- 7'8"ish tall. Had to drop him down a level on set to get him in shot. Lean, but strong. In short, a killer. We started with the head. Then with all the bits, we had the rest. It just came together to us until was just right. No, some of the grown-ups were not taken with the idea. It was taking a different direction from the other bots, but I thought it should. And when someone said, "I don't think you would find a robot like that on a spaceship," my reply was, "You would on mine." The rest is history.|Bill Hargreaves, on designing IG-88|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/interview-bill-hargreaves-former-jawa-scavenger-and-galactic-prop-man}}
IG-88, originally referred to as a "chrome war droid" in the script and also called "Phlutdroid" during production,<ref name="IG-88 Bts">{{DB|droid|ig88|IG-88}}</ref> was created for the [[1980]] film [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']].<ref name="The Empire Strikes Back" /> His mechanical puppet<ref name="IG-88 Bts" /> was constructed by [[Bill Hargreaves]] and [[Steve Short]]<ref name="Bill Hargreaves">{{SW|url=news/interview-bill-hargreaves-former-jawa-scavenger-and-galactic-prop-man|text=Interview: Bill Hargreaves&mdash;Former Jawa Scavenger and Galactic Prop Man}}</ref> of the props team and special effects department,<ref name="Costumes">''[[Star Wars Costumes: The Original Trilogy]]''</ref> whose design was a complete departure from concept artist [[Ralph McQuarrie]]'s streamlined, if not elegant, version.
