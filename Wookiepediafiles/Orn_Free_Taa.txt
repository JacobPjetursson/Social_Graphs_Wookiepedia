{{Quote|Need I remind you that it is I who leads our people in the Senate!|Orn Free Taa, to political rival [[Cham Syndulla]]|audio=NeedIRemindYou-LoR.ogg|Liberty on Ryloth}}
'''Orn Free Taa''' was a [[Sexes|male]] [[Rutian]] [[Twi'lek]] who [[Senator|represented]] his [[homeworld]] of [[Ryloth]] in the [[Galactic Senate]] during the waning [[Standard year|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic]]. Because he was content with amassing riches for himself on [[Coruscant]], Taa was very unpopular on Ryloth. During the [[Separatist Crisis]], Taa joined the [[Loyalist Committee]], which supported the Republic's leader, [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]], against the growing threat of [[Count]] [[Dooku]]'s [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. Despite his professed loyalty, Taa was corrupt and self-indulgent, which made him a perfect incarnation of everything the Confederacy considered rotten about the Republic. When the Galactic Empire was formed Taa retained his position in the Senate and, more importantly to him, his wealth.<ref name="DB" />

==Biography==
===Naboo Crisis===
Taa was among the [[senator]]s who supported [[Monarch of Naboo|Queen]] [[Padmé Amidala]]'s [[Vote of No Confidence]] to replace [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Finis Valorum]] with a stronger chancellor during [[Naboo]] [[Invasion of Naboo|occupation]] by the [[Trade Federation]].<ref name="TPM">[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']]</ref>

===The Separatist Crisis===
[[File:Bail.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Taa alongside Bail Organa in the Senate]]
Ten [[Standard year|years]] later, Taa was present in Chancellor [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine's]] [[Emperor's office|office]] suite when Amidala arrived to the [[Galactic Senate|Senate]] following assassination [[Plot to assassinate Padmé Amidala|attempt]] on [[Sexes|her]]. He was later present in the Senate when [[Jar Jar Binks]] pushed for Palpatine to have full emergency powers.<ref name="AOC" /> Taa represented [[Ryloth]] in the Galactic Senate; he was a trusted advisor to Palpatine and a perfect symbol of corruption in government as he was extravagant with his spending and lived in utter luxury.<ref name="DB" />

===Clone Wars===
When the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist Alliance]] [[Battle of Ryloth|invaded]] Ryloth, Taa contacted [[King]] [[Katuunko]] of [[Toydaria]] in efforts to receive aid to help the people on his [[planet]].<ref name="SL">{{TCW|Supply Lines}}</ref> When the [[Galactic Republic|Republic]] [[Republic Navy|fleet]] broke through the Separatist [[blockade]], Taa arrived on Ryloth where he came into conflict with his rival [[Cham Syndulla]] over what to do with the occupation. When the [[Confederacy military|Separatist troops]] were defeated and [[Wat Tambor]] was arrested, Taa waved at the crowds and settled his arguments with Syndulla.<ref name="Liberty">{{TCW|Liberty on Ryloth}}</ref>

When [[Duke|Duchess]] [[Satine Kryze]] of [[Mandalore]] traveled from [[Sundari]] to [[Coruscant]] in order to represent her planet in the Senate she invited several senators and allies to accompany her on the aircraft. The senators included [[Kin Robb]] and [[Tal Merrik]]. Taa was present in the luxury suite where Duchess Satine rejected any statements made by Taa while he tried to push her towards joining the Republic. Taa then calmed [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and Satine while they argued over the [[Clone Wars|war]] and reasons to fight. He dined alongside the other members of the party where he urged that they not talk about [[politics]] and enjoy the [[Nuna]] legs. During the [[Skirmish aboard the Coronet|attack]] from [[SD-K4 assassin droid]]s, Taa was very frightened and cowered away from the table with his [[aide]]s. The senator then calmed down and sat back down at the table where he happily ate his favorite meal, however he was horrified when Kenobi rendered with the final metallic probe. When the Separatist Alliance attacked he ran from the dining suite. He survived the events.<ref name="VoT">{{TCW|Voyage of Temptation}}</ref>

When [[Cad Bane]] and several other [[bounty hunter]]s [[Senate hostage crisis|took over]] the Republic Senate Taa rushed to Palpatine's office to inform him of the trouble. When Bane contacted Palpatine and told him of his deal, the bargain being that the Republic release [[Ziro Desilijic Tiure|Ziro]] and in return the trapped Senators would be released as well. Palpatine decided to comply with Bane and sent Taa down to the [[prison]] with the [[pardon disc]], he was not happy with the thought of being at the prison which Ziro even commented upon. Taa was, however, very happy when the Chancellor was freed and Bane's cohorts were surrounded by Commander [[CC-1010|Fox's]] [[Coruscant Guard]].<ref name="Hostage Crisis">{{TCW|Hostage Crisis}}</ref> During the [[Republic military enhancement bill|bill]] that promoted further funding for the war speaker for the opposing campaign [[Bail Organa]] was injured, meaning he was unable to attend and speak. This led to a large delay for the speech, during the delay [[Mee Deechi]] pushed for the voting to start. Taa agreed with this notion and vocally expressed his opinion, when Padmé Amidala stepped forward to the speech, Taa looked very surprised at a partisan volunteering to make the speech. When Amidala gave her moving speech however, Taa was visibly impressed and applauded loudly.<ref name="Pursuit">{{TCW|Pursuit of Peace}}</ref>

When Palpatine was [[Battle of Coruscant|rescued]] from [[General]] [[Grievous]], Taa was among the Senators who greeted him on the landing platform. He stood in the second row and was quick to walk back inside, Taa was pleased that Palpatine returned.<ref name="Episode III">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref>

===Age of the Empire===
When Palpatine [[Proclamation of the New Order|declared]] the first ever [[Galactic Empire]], Taa was present in the [[Imperial Senate|Senate]].<ref name="Episode III" /> Taa also continued to loyally serve under the [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor's]] dictatorship thus keeping his wealth and heavy self indulgence. Taa was however little more than a puppet delegate, serving under [[Moff]] [[Delian Mors]] and willingly taking part in the exploitation of his home world. However Taa was still happy as he retained his wealth and luxurious habits due to being a supporter of the Empire. After previously allying himself with his rival Cham Syndulla during the Clone Wars, he now found himself at war with him. As head of the [[Free Ryloth movement]], Syndulla carried out a [[Ryloth insurgency|series of attacks]] against the [[Imperial Military|Imperial occupation forces]] on Ryloth, which gained the attention of the Emperor and his [[Sith apprentice|apprentice]] [[Darth]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Vader]].<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

After the attacks by the Free Ryloth movement began to slow the [[spice]] production on Ryloth, Taa was summoned for an audience with the Emperor. Now openly afraid of Palpatine and his apprentice, Taa feared the worst as he optimistically tried to reassure the Emperor that the [[Twi'lek security force]]s and Moff Mors would have the situation under control. Palpatine dismissed Taa's assertion and informed him that he had come to a decision. Taa was relieved to hear that the Emperor's decision was to accompany him and Vader on an [[Mission to Ryloth|official visit]] to Ryloth to investigate the matter personally. The senator expressed his reluctance to return to Ryloth, but Palpatine assured him his presence would reassure the people they were truly part of the Empire.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

Vader surmised that Taa was loyal to the Empire, though he would put his own interests first, Ryloth's interests second, and the Empire's third. Taa, his senatorial staff, and the two [[Sith Lord]]s traveled on the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|Imperial Star Destroyer]] ''[[Perilous]]'' to Ryloth. However, one of Taa's senatorial staff leaked information about the trip to the Free Ryloth movement. Upon entering the [[Ryloth system]], the ''Perilous'' was attacked by [[Realspace|space]] [[mine]]s, [[Variable Geometry Self-Propelled Battle Droid, Mark I|Vulture droids]], and Free Ryloth rebels disguised as maintenance crew.<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />

During the attack, Taa was [[Force choke]]d by an enraged Vader, who released him at the Emperor's urging. Vader informed Taa that there was a [[spy]] among his staff. Taa apologised to Vader and the Emperor and vowed to find the [[Treason|traitor]]. The Emperor was convinced of Taa's loyalty but warned the Senator that it did not mitigate his fault; emphasizing that Taa was ignorant that he had a traitor among his staff. The Emperor then ordered his [[Emperor's Royal Guard|royal guards]] to restrict the senatorial staff to their quarters and to deny them access to communications equipment and computer terminals. The Emperor then warned Taa that harsher measures would be required in the future to quell unrest on Ryloth. Taa acceded to the Emperor's demands. When the ''Perilous'' fell apart, Taa and his staff escaped the [[Star Destroyer]] with Vader likening him to a "[[rat]] finding his way off a sinking [[Starship|ship]]."<ref name="Lords of the Sith" />
