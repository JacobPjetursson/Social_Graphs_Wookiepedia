{{Quotetrans|You're outmanned, laserblade.|Embo, to Anakin Skywalker|Bounty Hunters (episode)}}
'''Embo''' was a [[Kyuzo]] [[Sexes|male]] [[bounty hunter]] who lived during the [[Fall of the Republic|era]] of the [[Clone Wars]]. He carried a [[bowcaster]] and wore a large-rimmed circular [[hat]], which he used as a weapon or a shield. Embo was known to work as part of [[Sugi (bounty hunter)|Sugi's]] band of [[bounty]] hunters, though on his own he was renowned as one of the most skilled bounty hunters of his [[time]], at one point managing to match the [[Jedi]] [[Anakin Skywalker]]. He also owned a pet [[anooba]] named [[Marrok]] and a saucer-shaped [[starship]] called the ''[[Guillotine (starship)|Guillotine]]''.

==Biography==
===The Clone Wars===
====Battle on Felucia====
[[File:EmboBowcaster.png|thumb|left|250px|Embo prepares to take out a Weequay pirate.]]
A [[Sexes|male]] [[Kyuzo]] from [[Phatrong]],<ref name=<ref name="Embo" /> Embo was working as a [[bounty hunter]] during the [[Clone Wars]]. At one point, he was part of [[Sugi (bounty hunter)|Sugi's]] band of [[Sugi's bounty hunters|bounty hunters]], alongside [[Rumi Paramita]] and [[Seripas]]. The band of bounty hunters were employed by [[Casiss]], the leader of a [[farm]]ing village on the [[planet]] [[Felucia]], to protect the villagers and their harvest of [[Nysillin]] from a [[Ohnaka Gang|gang]] of [[pirate]]s led by [[Hondo Ohnaka]]. Shortly after they had been hired, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], [[Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Ahsoka Tano]] crash-landed on Felucia and discovered the village. A brief standoff between the [[Jedi]] and the hunters took place before Casiss intervened, begging the two groups to work together against the pirates.<ref name="Bounty Hunters" />

The Jedi were initially reluctant to help the villagers, but were swayed after a brief encounter with Ohnaka, the leader of the gang, whom the Jedi had met [[Mission to Florrum|once before]]. Refusing to be bought off by the pirates, the bounty hunters, along with the Jedi, began teaching the villagers to defend themselves. Embo, watching Skywalker train the villagers how to use a simple farming tool as a weapon, chuckled at their lack of experience. While the villagers were preparing to [[Skirmish on Felucia|fight]], Sugi spotted a lone pirate watching from a nearby ridge. Embo was sent to deal with the [[scout]] and the Kyuzo quickly took him out, disabling his [[Starhawk speeder bike]] with his [[bowcaster]] and blocking the pirate's shots using his [[Kyuzo war shield|metallic hat]], before snapping the [[Weequay]]'s neck with his bare hands. Skywalker commended Embo for his actions, but the fact that the scout would no longer check back in with Hondo meant the villagers didn't have any [[time]] to waste.<ref name="Bounty Hunters" />

[[File:Embo_hurt.png|thumb|right|250px|Embo lies wounded.]]
Soon afterwards, the pirates attacked the village. Dozens of pirates on [[speeder bike]]s swept into the village, firing at the defenders. Embo dispatched one of the pirates and commandeered a [[speeder]] bike, using it to take out several others. When Ohnaka arrived on the scene in his [[Tank (vehicle)|tank]], however, Embo wasn't quick enough to avoid one of the tank's blasts and was hit. With a badly wounded right arm, Embo was helped into the main barn at the center of the village by Sugi and the others, unable to participate in the battle any longer. After Ohnaka and his pirates retreated and fled the [[Felucia system|system]], Embo left in Sugi's [[Starship|ship]], ''[[Halo]]'', along with the Jedi, and traveled to a [[Galactic Republic|Republic]] outpost.<ref name="Bounty Hunters" />

====Freelancing====
[[File:EmboMarrock-Revenge.png|thumb|left|Embo with Marrok during the Clone Wars]]
At one point, Embo and Sugi, along with the Kyuzo's pet [[anooba]] [[Marrok]], were present at the [[Jabba's Palace|palace]] of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the [[Hutt]] on [[Tatooine]]. While they were there, [[Pantoran]] [[diplomat]]s [[Papanoida]] and his son, [[Ion Papanoida|Ion]], were searching for [[Greedo]], a [[Rodian]] bounty hunter that had [[Kidnapping of the Papanoida daughters|kidnapped]] Papanoida's daughters.<ref name="Sphere of Influence">{{TCW|Sphere of Influence}}</ref>

Later on, Embo was present on [[Serenno]] with eleven other bounty hunters — one of which was, in reality, Obi-Wan Kenobi, disguised as [[Rako Hardeen]] — to fight in the "[[Box]]", which had been designed by [[Moralo Eval]]. Embo was one of the few hunters to survive the [[Tournament on Serenno|challenge]], and was assigned by [[Count]] [[Dooku]] to kidnap [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]].<ref name="The Box">{{TCW|The Box}}</ref>

Embo then traveled to [[Naboo]] to carry out the daring mission. The hunters successfully [[Skirmish in Theed|kidnapped]] the Chancellor, assuming the roles of [[Senate Commando]]s through the use of the [[holographic disguise matrix]], developed by [[Sinrich]]. Embo rushed the Chancellor away but failed to escape and were arrested by Skywalker and [[Mace Windu]].<ref name="Crisis on Naboo" />

Embo did not remain in Republic custody for long, however. Some time later, he and Marrok were seen sharing a table at [[Chalmun's Cantina]], while the pair were also present outside a hut in [[Mos Eisley|the town]].<ref name="Bounty">{{TCW|Bounty (episode)|Bounty}}</ref>

====Employed by the Hutts====
[[File:BountyHunterTableDance-Eminence.png|thumb|left|250px|Embo prepares to defend his employers.]]
Some time later, Embo was employed by the [[Grand Hutt Council]] as a [[bodyguard]], along with Sugi, [[Dengar]] and [[Latts Razzi]]. When [[Maul|Darth Maul]] and his brother, [[Savage Opress]], representing the [[Shadow Collective]], [[Mission to Nal Hutta|threatened]] the [[Hutt Clan|Hutts]], Embo and the others sprang into action to defend their employers. At first the bounty hunters were able to beat the brothers back, but they were driven back when the forces of [[Death Watch]] joined in the attack. Embo went up against Opress on his own, saved from the [[Nightbrothers|Nightbrother]] only by the strength of his hat. When it was clear that they couldn't win, Embo and the others retreated, abandoning their employers.<ref name="Eminence" />

====Targeting Clovis====
Sometime after this, Embo [[Mission to Scipio|traveled]] to [[Scipio]], the home planet of [[Rush Clovis]], whom he had been hired to drive off the [[InterGalactic Banking Clan]] vault world. When Clovis arrived, along with [[Padmé Amidala]] and Skywalker, Embo killed Amidala's [[Naboo Royal Handmaidens|aide]], [[Teckla Minnau]], and disabled the trio's ship, forcing them to flee through the snow. Embo, chasing Clovis, was held at bay by Skywalker until the trio was saved by [[R2-D2]], who was [[pilot]]ing their [[T-6 shuttle|ship]]. Having accomplished his mission, Embo informed his employer, [[Darth]] Sidious, that Clovis had escaped&mdash;just as the [[Dark Lord of the Sith|Dark Lord]] had planned.<ref name="An Old Friend">{{TCW|An Old Friend}}</ref>

====Krayt's Claw====
In the latter [[Standard month|months]] of the war, Embo began taking jobs on a regular basis with [[Boba Fett]]'s team of bounty hunters, [[Krayt's Claw]]. One job in particular found the crew hired by former ally of the [[Sith]], [[Asajj Ventress]], to assist in the rescue of her lover, [[Quinlan Vos]]. This was his first time working with the [[Dathomirian]] [[Nightsisters|Nightsister]] and former [[Sith apprentice]]. Embo and his anooba Marrok traveled to Serenno on the ''[[Guillotine (starship)|Guillotine]]'' and rendezvoused with Krayt's Claw and Ventress at the planet's [[spaceport]]. While the [[Mission to Serenno (Krayt's Claw)|mission]] proved to be a failure, Embo and the rest of Fett's team escaped a direct encounter with the [[Sith Lord]] Count Dooku, alive.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

===Inspiring Sabine===
Several [[Standard year|years]] before the [[Battle of Yavin]], Embo was depicted in some [[graffiti]] art, courtesy of [[Sabine Wren]], aboard the ''[[Ghost]]'', the ship of [[Hera Syndulla]].<ref name="Fighter Flight">{{Rebels|Fighter Flight}}</ref>

===New Republic===
====Jakku====
In 5 ABY,<ref name="Galactic Atlas">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]''</ref> Embo, along with the bountry hunters Dengar and a [[Rodian]] named [[Jeeta]], was hired by [[Mercurial Swift]] in order to capture [[Jas Emari]], Sugi's niece. The [[Black Sun]] crime [[boss]] [[Gyuti]] had imposed a [[bounty]] on Emari's head. Embo joined Swift's party because he wanted to clear his debts. After learning that [[Niima|Niima the Hutt]] had taken Jas captive on [[Jakku]], Embo and the other bounty hunters traveled to [[Niima's temple]] to pick her up. Swift went into Emari's cell to fetch her, intending to collect the bounty for himself and abandon his crew. However, Jas broke free and overpowered her captors.<ref name="Empire's End">''[[Aftermath: Empire's End]]''</ref>

After escaping her captors, Jas headed to the [[hangar]] only to find Embo and Dengar guarding Swift's [[Corellian shuttle]]. They began speaking, and during the conversation Embo mentioned the [[death]] of Marrok, which had happened years before. Knowing that Embo had incurred debts, Jas tried to remind Embo that he and her aunt Sugi had worked together. Emari convinced Embo to let her take the ship, saying that he was old and that Marrok always liked her. Dengar tried to stop Jas but she managed to escape on the Corellian [[shuttle]].<ref name="Empire's End" />

Later, Jas Emari and the [[New Republic]] operative [[Norra Wexley]] returned to Niima's temple. In return for ferrying Niima back to her temple, the Hutt crime lady had outfitted them with an old [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] shuttle, old [[Clothing|uniforms]], and clearance codes to enter the [[Main Imperial base]] on Jakku. Embo and the rest of Swift's party cornered Jas and Niima. While Norra escaped with her [[Temmin Wexley|son's]] [[droid]] [[Mister Bones]] aboard the shuttle, Jas stayed behind in order to allow Norra to proceed with her mission to capture [[Grand Admiral]] [[Rae Sloane]].<ref name="Empire's End" />

Following Emari's capture, Swift attempted to travel to [[Nar Shaddaa]] to deliver Jas to Boss Gyuti. However, they were unable to leave due to the [[Battle of Jakku]]. During the wait, Jas managed to convince Embo, Dengar, and Jeeta to turn against Swift. She offered to secure them pardons from the New Republic if they switched sides. Swift tried to object but was thrown out of the shuttle by Jas with the help of Dengar. Embo, Jeeta, and Dengar then became Jas' crew. They took Swift's shuttle to the [[Jakku Observatory]] where they picked up Norra, who had joined forces with Sloane and her estranged [[Marriage|husband]] [[Brentin Lore Wexley]] to stop [[Gallius Rax]] from destroying Jakku as part of the late [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor's]] [[Contingency]] plan.<ref name="Empire's End" />

====After the Battle of Jakku====
Following the Battle of Jakku and the [[Galactic Concordance]], Embo and the rest of Emari's crew received full pardons from the New Republic with the help of Jas' friend [[Sinjir Rath Velus]], a former Imperial [[loyalty officer]] who had become an [[Advisor|adviser]] to [[Chancellor (New Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Mon Mothma]]. They also received enough [[Currency|money]] from the New Republic and continued to work with Emari as her crew.<ref name="Empire's End" />

==Personality and traits==
[[File:Embo-TCWs2BR3.png|thumb|right|Embo, equipped with his bowcaster]]
Embo was a quiet, stoic and disciplined individual, speaking only in his native [[Kyuzo (language)|language]],<ref name="Bounty Hunters" /> which made it difficult for others to understand him. He was also totally ruthless, dispatching foe after foe without mercy or remorse, and using his unorthodox weapons to lethal effect.<ref name="An Old Friend" />

Embo also respected the [[Zabrak]] bounty hunter Sugi and her niece Jas Emari. Having incurred debts, Embo reluctantly accepted an offer from Mercurial Swift to join his crew and collect Boss Gyuti's bounty on Jas. However, Embo was unwilling to hurt Jas since they had worked together in the past. On one occasion, he allowed Jas to escape. On another, he and his fellow bounty hunters Dengar and Jeeta turned against Swift after Jas convinced them to join forces with her in return for securing pardons from the New Republic. Due to their dislike for Swift, Embo did not object to Dengar and Jas throwing Swift out of his shuttle.<ref name="Empire's End" />

==Skills and abilities==
A deadly fighter, Embo was skilled in a variety of areas. Extremely acrobatic, Embo could jump very high and run faster than any [[human]],<ref name="Bounty Hunters" /> while his proficiency in unarmed combat made him the equal of any Jedi or Sith when it came to close-quarters fighting.<ref name="Eminence" /> Embo was very skilled with his chosen weapons, using his rimmed hat to take out opponents from a distance, while he was also a good shot with his bowcaster.<ref name="An Old Friend" /> At one point in the Clone Wars, Embo was considered second only to [[Cad Bane]] in the entire [[The galaxy|galaxy]].<ref name="The Box" />

==Equipment==
Unlike bounty hunters such as Cad Bane or [[Jango Fett]], Embo relied little on technology. Embo's primary weapons were a bowcaster and his unique metallic, wide-rimmed hat, which doubled as a shield and as a throwing weapon. During the Clone Wars, Embo often wore a chest plate, with an ammunition [[bandolier]] slung over his shoulder, and wore a long [[Color|red]] fighting skirt decorated with gold symbols.<ref name="Bounty Hunters" />

==Behind the scenes==
Embo was voiced by supervising director [[Dave Filoni]]. The character was intended to be killed off at the end of "[[Bounty Hunters (episode)|Bounty Hunters]]." However, after discussion about the character and story among the production team (who felt that he was a "cool" character), they decided to have him injured by Hondo as seen in the final version.<ref name="TCW">{{SW|url=explore/the-clone-wars/ep217/#!/media/commentary|text=Episode Featurette #2.17: Bounty Hunters}}</ref> "[[Bounty Hunters (episode)|Bounty Hunters]]". The unfinished version can be seen from the behind-the-scenes clips about the season included in the DVD and Blu-ray releases.

Embo's species, the Kyuzo, was named after the character "Kyuzo" in the film ''[[wikipedia:Seven Samurai|Seven Samurai]]''. This is one of many homages to the film found in Embo's first episode, "Bounty Hunters". Embo's alien language, devised by Filoni, is actually a badly enunciated version of the Smurfs Books, written in French. In the Dark Disciple book, he instead uses Italian soccer players surnames.

Embo was made into a [[LEGO]] minifigure in 2011. It appeared in the set "7930 Bounty Hunter Gunship", alongside Sugi, [[Aurra Sing]] and an [[Assassin droid|elite assassin droid]]. The set featured a version of the ''Halo'', the ship found in the episode "Bounty Hunters".

When the complete season 4 DVD collection of the Clone Wars series was released, Embo appeared on a special wanted poster along with Cad Bane, Rako Hardeen, Moralo Eval, and Derrown, that came in the package.

Before the cancellation of [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|The Clone Wars]] TV series, Embo was set to make an appearance during a four-episode arc starring Boba Fett and Cad Bane. In a clip revealed during the "Animated Origins and Unexpected Fates" panel at [[Celebration Orlando]] in 2017, Embo was seen siding with Cad Bane during a stand-off against Boba Fett and other Bounty Hunters, however he and Bossk would betray Bane by allowing Fett to duel Bane without intervening.<ref name="CO 17 AOaUF panel">{{SWYoutube|85Jw-63YNYI|text=Star Wars Celebration Orlando 2017: Animated Origins and Unexpected Fates}}</ref>
