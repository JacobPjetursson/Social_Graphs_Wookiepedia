{{Quote|I accept this sword for my sister, for my clan, and for all of Mandalore.|Bo-Katan Kryze accepts the [[Darksaber]] and unites several [[Mandalorian clan]]s|Star Wars Rebels: Heroes of Mandalore}}
'''Bo-Katan Kryze''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|female]] who was the leader of the [[Nite Owls]] and a [[lieutenant]] in [[Death Watch]], a [[Mandalorian]] [[terrorist]] group, and later during the [[Imperial Era]], became [[Mand'alor]]. During the [[Clone Wars]], Kryze's sister, [[Satine Kryze|Satine]], ruled as the [[Duke|Duchess]] of [[Mandalore]], and Kryze sought to undo her pacifistic teachings, believing that Mandalore should take pride in its martial history. After [[Governor]] [[Pre Vizsla]] of [[Concordia]] was publicly exposed as the leader of [[Death]] Watch, the splinter group was [[Exile (punishment)|exiled]] from the [[Mandalore system]]. In [[19 BBY]], Kryze and Vizsla discovered the [[Sith Lord]]s [[Maul|Darth Maul]] and [[Savage Opress]]. With the [[Sith]], Kryze and Vizsla plotted to reclaim Mandalore, and through Maul's planning, they united several criminal syndicates to form the [[Shadow Collective]]. Launching a [[takeover of Mandalore]], Satine's rule was overthrown, and Vizsla took control of the [[planet]].

However, Maul challenged Vizsla, and the Sith Lord defeated him, taking the throne and appointing [[Prime Minister]] [[Almec]] as a puppet leader. Kryze and a group of Mandalorian loyalists refused to recognize Maul's rule, and they liberated Satine from the [[royal prison]], contacting [[Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] for help. Due to Mandalore's neutrality, Kenobi was forced to come alone, and he was captured by Maul, who then killed Satine. When Kenobi was brought to the [[prison]], Kryze and her rebels freed the [[Jedi]], and Mandalore was swept into a [[Mandalorian civil war (Clone Wars)|civil war]] as Maul's forces fought to reclaim him. Before Kenobi left the planet, Kryze requested that the [[Galactic Republic]] be informed of the events, hoping that a Republic invasion would result in Maul's death. Less than a year later, Kryze's desire was fulfilled, and the Republic laid [[Siege of Mandalore|siege to Mandalore]], driving Maul from the planet. She then became [[Lord|Lady]] of [[House Kryze]] and [[Regent]] of Mandalore. However, she lost her position when she refused to follow the newly [[Proclamation of the New Order|appointed]] [[Galactic Emperor]], [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] and [[Clan Saxon]] took over.

During the Republic's occupation of Mandalore, the government [[Proclamation of the New Order|reorganized]] into the [[Galactic Empire]], and a new wave of violence claimed the planet. In [[2 BBY]], [[Clan Wren]] of [[Krownest]] chose to resist the Empire, leading the Imperial loyalists of [[Clan Saxon]] to fight them. These actions threw Mandalore into another [[Mandalorian civil war (Imperial Era)|civil war]]. During the war, Kryze encountered [[Count]]ess [[Ursa Wren]] and [[Sabine Wren]] of Clan Wren, who were seeking a Mandalorian worthy of wielding the [[darksaber]] and claiming the title of [[Mand'alor]]. With the Wrens' approval, Kryze took the weapon and [[Mandalorian resistance|rallied the support]] of several Mandalorians.

[[File:SurroundedByDeathWatch-AFIN.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Bo-Katan Kryze meets Lux Bonteri on Carlac.]]
In [[20 BBY]],<ref name="Galactic Atlas" /> Death Watch was contacted by [[Lux Bonteri]], who claimed that his [[Parent|mother]], [[Senator]] [[Mina Bonteri]], had been betrayed and killed by [[Count]] [[Dooku]], leader of the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. The Death Watch had also been betrayed by Dooku, and Bonteri, who had gathered information of the count's whereabouts, wished to unite, seeking revenge. Vizsla agreed, and Bonteri traveled to Carlac. When Bonteri arrived, Kryze led a [[squad]] of Death Watch [[soldier]]s to meet him, verifying that he brought the information. Noticing that Bonteri was accompanied by a [[Togruta]] girl, Kryze asked who she was. The Togruta&mdash;secretly [[Jedi]] [[Padawan]] [[Ahsoka Tano]]&mdash;claimed to be Bonteri's betrothed. Wary of an approaching snow storm, Kryze ordered the squad to escort the new arrivals to the Death Watch camp.<ref name="A Friend in Need">{{TCW|A Friend in Need}}</ref>

At the camp, Kryze showed Bonteri and Tano to Vizsla's tent. When Vizsla entered, he requested Tano to leave, so Kryze brought the Togruta to a tent for [[Ming Po]] women who had been taken from a [[Ming Po town|nearby village]]. Later, during a feast in the camp's main tent, Kryze stood by Vizsla as [[Chief]]tain [[Pieter]] of the Ming Po [[City|town]] arrived, demanding that the women be released. Vizsla agreed to return them in the morning, and Pieter left. However, when the morning came, Vizsla killed Pieter's granddaughter [[Tryla]], and Death Watch destroyed the village. Tano attempted to stop the attack, revealing herself to be a Jedi, so Death Watch apprehended her and dragged her back to the camp.<ref name="A Friend in Need" />

[[File:Bo-Katan vs Ahsoka.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Kryze fights Ahsoka Tano.]]
However, Tano escaped her restraints, and Kryze prepared to fight the Jedi. Vizsla told Kryze to stand down, and he engaged Tano in [[lightsaber combat]]. Tano received help when a group of refurbished [[battle droid]]s joined the [[Battle on Carlac|fight]], and Kryze fought off the new attackers, using her [[blaster pistol]]s to down [[battle droid 513]]. During the battle, Tano and Bonteri boarded a [[landspeeder]] and fled. At Vizsla's command, Kryze and two other Mandalorians pursued, and the lieutenant landed on the [[speeder]], brawling with the young Jedi. Tano ultimately bested Kryze, and the Mandalorian was kicked off the vehicle. Soon after, Bonteri and Tano escaped the planet.<ref name="A Friend in Need" />

===Maul and the Shadow Collective===
{{Quote|Should we rub 'em out?''"<br />"''No, I want to hear their story.|Kryze and Pre Vizsla, finding Darth Maul and Savage Opress|Eminence (episode)}}
Sometime later, Death Watch abandoned their base on Carlac and established a [[Zanbar Death Watch camp|new camp]] on the moon [[Zanbar]].<ref name="Eminence" /> In [[19 BBY]],<ref name="Galactic Atlas" /> Death Watch located an [[escape pod]] drifting through [[Realspace|space]], so Kryze, Vizsla, and a squad investigated. Entering the pod, the Mandalorians found [[lightsaber]]s and two unconscious, wounded [[Zabrak]]s&mdash;[[Maul|Darth Maul]] and [[Savage Opress]], [[Sith Lord]]s and brothers. Kryze asked if she should kill them, but Vizsla, curious of the pair's origins, ordered the Zabraks to be brought from the pod to a [[Kom'rk-class fighter|''Kom'rk''-class fighter]]. When the two were brought aboard, Kryze [[pilot]]ed the [[starship]] through [[hyperspace]], back to Zandar. Once Maul awoke, Vizsla demanded to know who he was, while Kryze held Opress at gunpoint. Complying, Maul revealed they were [[Sith]] Lords and brothers. When Vizsla asked if they had an allegiance to Dooku, the Zabrak replied that they were allied with no one and that they sought revenge against the Jedi [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]&mdash;the same Jedi responsible for Death Watch's exile.<ref name="Eminence" />

[[File:MaulTorturesBoKatan-Eminence.png|thumb|left|300px|Darth Maul chokes Kryze for doubting his capabilities.]]
After Maul healed, he met with Vizsla again, and they discussed plans to punish Kenobi and reclaim Mandalore. However, still impacted by Dooku's betrayal, Kryze reminded Vizsla that Death Watch's past alliance with Sith had ended poorly. When Kryze claimed the Sith were no better than Jedi, Maul [[Force choke]]d the lieutenant, silencing her and stating that doubt would lead to failure. Maul proposed his plan once again, and he released Kryze. As Kryze recovered, Vizsla put Maul's proposal to a vote among Death Watch. Ultimately, the vote decided to join the Sith brothers and liberate Mandalore of Duchess Satine's New Mandalorians.<ref name="Eminence" />

The first step in Maul's plan was to assemble an [[army]]&mdash;the [[Shadow Collective]]&mdash;beginning with the [[Black Sun]] crime syndicate. Kryze, Vizsla, and the Sith [[Mission to Mustafar (Death Watch)|traveled]] to the [[Black Sun fortress]] on the planet [[Mustafar]]. There, the group met [[Ziton Moj]], who took Vizsla, Maul, and Opress to see the Black Sun leaders while Kryze remained with the Death Watch warriors. The talks with the Black Sun failed, so Opress killed them, appointing Moj as the new leader and forcing him to join. With the additional forces, the newly formed Shadow Collective returned to Zanbar. Soon after, as Kryze, Vizsla, and Maul reviewed the plan, the camp was visited by the [[Pyke Syndicate]]. Their leader, [[Lom Pyke]], greeted the trio, requesting to join their operation. Accepting, the offer, Vizsla ordered the Shadow Collective [[troop]]s to prepare for travel to [[Nal Hutta]], planning to recruit the [[Hutt Clan]].<ref name="Eminence" />

[[File:DeathWatchElite-Eminence.png|thumb|right|300px|Kryze led the attack on Jabba's Palace, allowing Maul to recruit the Hutt Clan.]]
After arriving on the [[swamp]]y planet, Kryze stayed with the ships while Vizsla and the Sith entered [[Gardulla the Hutt's Palace]]. The [[Mission to Nal Hutta|negotiations]] were unsuccessful, and fight broke out between Kryze's Nite Owls and the [[Hutt]]s' soldiers. Vizsla ordered Kryze to secure the landing platform, and the Hutt forces retreated soon after. Kryze's warriors gave chase, and the lieutenant caught the Hutt [[crime lord]] [[Oruba]]. Maul demanded to know where to find the other Hutts, threatening the crime lord. Oruba named [[Jabba's Palace]] on the planet [[Tatooine]], and Opress killed the Hutt. With the information, the Shadow Collective traveled to Tatooine, where Kryze led an [[attack on Jabba's Palace]], and Maul forced [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] and the Hutt families to join them. In the fight's aftermath, Vizsla advised Kryze to remain focused, revealing that he intended to betray Sith brothers once Mandalore was secured.<ref name="Eminence" />

===Takeover of Mandalore===
{{Quote|I claim this sword and my rightful place as leader of Death Watch.''"<br />"''Never. No outsider will ever rule Mandalore.''"<br />"''Hmm. If you will not join me, you will all die.''"<br />"''You're all traitors.''"<br />"''Unfortunately for you, history will not see it that way. Execute them!|Darth Maul and Kryze, following Vizsla's demise|Shades of Reason}}
Back on Zanbar, Kryze, Maul, Vizsla, and the other conspirators prepared for the [[Takeover of Mandalore|takeover]], planning for Maul's Shadow Collective to strike targets in [[Sundari]], Mandalore's [[capital]], in order to make<ref name="Shades of Reason">{{TCW|Shades of Reason}}</ref> Kryze's Duchess sister<ref name="Bo-Katan" /> look weak. Vizsla complimented Maul's plan, and Kryze agreed. After the meeting, however, Kryze consulted with Vizsla, saying that the plan was too risky, and that the Zabraks were untrustworthy. Vizsla addressed Kryze's concerns, explaining that after Maul's forces served their purpose, they would be executed. Kryze left to prepare her Nite Owls, and the Shadow Collective embarked for Mandalore.<ref name="Shades of Reason" />

[[File:DeathWatchAndSatine-SoR.png|thumb|left|300px|Kryze accompanies Death Watch as her sister's pacifistic methods are denounced.]]
On Mandalore, the syndicate criminals attacked the specified locations, throwing Sundari's population into turmoil. When Duchess Satine began a speech from the [[Sundari Royal Palace]], Vizsla and Kryze arrived. Vizsla claimed that he was not responsible for the attacks, but that Death Watch would be able to save the city through armed opposition. Satine warned the populace to not listen to Vizsla, but her efforts failed, and the Sundari citizens chanted their support for Vizsla and Death Watch. When Vizsla finished his speech, he and Kryze returned to their ships.<ref name="Shades of Reason" />

With the support of Mandalore, the Death Watch forces began the next step of Maul's plan, apprehending the groups of Pyke Syndicate and Black Sun thugs throughout Sundari. In the city's [[Peace Park]], Kryze led her Nite Owls to capture a group of criminals led by Moj, and Kryze reassured a trio of scared children. The witnesses of the Nite Owl's actions thanked the warriors, hailing Kryze's forces as saviors. With the city's faux liberation, the population praised Vizsla, and he, along with Kryze and other members of Death Watch, broke into the Royal Palace, arresting the Duchess and the New Mandalorian leaders. Following the arrest, Kryze, in front of the subdued Moj, Pyke, and Opress, gave a speech to the people of Sundari, introducing Vizsla as the new [[Prime Minister]] of Mandalore and crediting him with the captured criminals. The crowd responded to the presentation with great enthusiasm, affirming Death Watch's new support.<ref name="Shades of Reason" />

[[File:Kryze-apprehends-Maul.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Kryze betrays Maul, taking the Sith Lord prisoner.]]
Later, Kryze brought Maul to meet with Death Watch. When they arrived in the palace, Vizsla stated that the captive Duchess would be used to lure Kenobi to Mandalore, creating an opportunity to kill the Jedi and finish their deal. However, Maul expressed his plans to expand to other [[star system]]s, and Vizsla responded by telling the Zabrak that his goals did not matter. On cue, Kryze and the Mandalorians pulled their blasters on the Sith Lord, taking him prisoner. With Maul in shackles, Kryze escorted him to the palace's balcony, where Vizsla addressed the citizens once more, stating that the violence was finally over. When the Zabrak struggled, Kryze clubbed him into submission with her blaster. Again, Vizsla denounced Satine's pacifistic methods, and the crowd chanted his name. When the speech concluded, Maul was imprisoned with his brother, Opress.<ref name="Shades of Reason" />

However, soon after Maul's imprisonment, he and Opress broke out, also freeing the corrupt, former Prime Minister, [[Almec]]. As Kryze and the rest of Death Watch were residing in the Royal Palace, the escaped trio arrived, and the Mandalorians raised their weapons at them. Maul demanded to duel Vizsla for control of Mandalore, and per Mandalorian tradition, Vizsla accepted. At Vizsla's word, Kryze threw [[Darth Maul's double-bladed lightsaber|Maul's lightsaber]] to the Zabrak, and Vizsla ignited his [[darksaber]], beginning the duel. Without interfering, Kryze and the Mandalorians looked on as the two fought, and although Vizsla was skilled, the Sith Lord ultimately bested him. The Death Watch leader gave his last words, and to Kryze's horror, Maul decapitated Vizsla.<ref name="Shades of Reason" />

When Maul declared himself as the new leader of Death Watch, Kryze refused to accept his rule, claiming that no outsider would ever rule Mandalore. At Maul's word, the traditionalist Mandalorians took aim at the Nite Owls, and Kryze called them out as [[Treason|traitors]]. The Sith Lord ordered Death Watch to execute them, and a firefight began. Firing upon her former Death Watch comrades and throwing explosives to provide cover, Kryze and several Nite Owls fled the palace. Later, following Maul's claim to the throne, the Sith Lord reinstated Almec as Prime Minister. Serving as the Zabrak's puppet leader, Almec addressed the citizens of Sundari, claiming that Vizsla had been murdered by Duchess Satine, and that the Death Watch leader had appointed him as Prime Minister.<ref name="Shades of Reason" />

===Civil war erupts===

[[File:Satine-rescue-TL.png|thumb|left|300px|Bo-Katan and Korkie rescue Satine from the royal prison.]]
After the narrow escape, Bo-Katan joined forces with her nephew [[Korkie Kryze]] and his classmates, [[Lagos]], [[Soniee]], and [[Amis]]. With the Death Watch loyalists, the group infiltrated the [[royal prison]], incapacitating the guards and rescuing Satine. Bo-Katan's appearance initially alarmed Satine, but Korkie reassured the former Duchess that she was on their side. When Satine asked her sister why she was helping, Bo-Katan stated that the enemy of her enemy was her friend. Once outside, Satine said that they should contact the [[Jedi Order]] for help. However, Korkie explained that the frequencies within Sundari were jammed, so they would need to leave to get a signal through. At Bo-Katan's word, the soldiers boarded [[Balutar-class swoop|Mandalorian speeder bikes]] and Satine entered an [[airspeeder]] with her sister and Korkie.<ref name="The Lawless" />

As the group departed from the [[prison]], they were spotted and pursued by Maul's [[Mandalorian super commando]]s. Acting quickly, Bo-Katan ordered her troops to engage them as she defended Satine's airspeeder. Despite Bo-Katan's efforts, the loyalists were overwhelmed, and the speeder was shot, crashing near the city's edge. Leaping from the damaged airspeeder, Satine ran beyond the city limits, sending a signal to the Jedi Order, requesting Kenobi's help. Bo-Katan and the Death Watch loyalists were forced to retreat, and Satine was captured.<ref name="The Lawless" />

Later, Kenobi arrived, and Bo-Katan watched him with interest, tracking the Jedi through Sundari. Soon after his arrival, Kenobi broke into the royal prison, attempting to liberate Satine. However, the rescue failed, and the two were brought before Maul, who killed Satine and ordered for Kenobi to be imprisoned.<ref name="The Lawless" /> Devastated by Satine's death,<ref name="Bo-Katan" /> Bo-Katan and her Mandalorian rebels ambushed Maul's warriors as they delivered Kenobi to the prison. Leaping onto the prison's landing pad, Bo-Katan fought Kenobi's escorts with [[hand-to-hand combat]], quickly defeating them. Bo-Katan introduced herself to Kenobi, and she freed him from his restraints, returning [[Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber (Jedi Master)|his lightsaber]] and giving him a [[jetpack]]. With Kenobi and the loyalists, Bo-Katan blasted away from the prison.<ref name="The Lawless" />

[[File:BoKatan-Kenobi_BattleOfSundari.png|thumb|right|300px|Kryze fights alongside Obi-Wan Kenobi as Mandalore is thrown into a civil war.]]
Maul's forces acted to reclaim Kenobi, pursuing Bo-Katan and the rebels through the city. In the ensuing [[Mandalorian civil war (Clone Wars)|battle]], Sundari became blackened by civil war, and Bo-Katan fought alongside Kenobi. Fighting their way toward a ''Kom'rk''-class fighter, Bo-Katan told Kenobi to return to the Republic and inform the [[Galactic Senate]] of the events that transpired. Kenobi warned Bo-Katan that doing so would likely lead to a Republic invasion, but the Mandalorian was willing to accept those consequences if it meant the death of Maul and survival of Mandalore. Kenobi realized that Bo-Katan was Satine's sister, and he apologized for her loss, boarding the [[starfighter]] and escaping the planet.<ref name="The Lawless" />

===Under the Empire===

Less than a few months later, Kryze's wish for a Republic invasion was fulfilled. The [[501st Legion]] of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]], led by Tano and [[Clone Captain]] [[Rex|CT-7567]] "Rex", laid [[Siege of Mandalore|siege]] to Maul's forces, driving the Sith Lord from the planet.<ref name="Ahsoka">''[[Ahsoka (novel)|Ahsoka]]''</ref> Kryze was named [[regent]] of Mandalore by the Jedi before they left.

[[File:Rebels Bo-Katan.png|thumb|left|300px|Kryze is presented the Darksaber by Wren.]]
Kryze and her Nite Owls played an important role in defeating Imperial forces during a skirmish at a [[Mandalore prison outpost]]. After exchanging greetings, Sabine offered the Darksaber to Kryze, who turned it down because she believed that she had failed as Regent. Bo-Katan later joined Sabine's Clan Wren forces and allies from the [[Spectres]] rebel cell in rescuing Sabine's father [[Alrich Wren]] from an Imperial convoy. Despite the success of the raid, their victory was overshadowed by news that Ursa Wren's forces had been wiped out by an [[Arc Pulse Generator]]. The Arc Pulse Generator, nicknamed the "Duchess", was capable of reacting with the [[beskar]] alloy inside [[Mandalorian armor]]; incinerating the wearers and leaving only charred armor behind.<ref name="Heroes of Mandalore" />

Kryze followed Sabine and her rebel comrades to the site of the battlefield, where they discovered charred Clan Wren armor and disintegrated bodies. Despite the carnage, they found that Ursa and her son [[Tristan Wren]] had survived the massacre. The group were then attacked by [[Imperial Super Commando]]s and three TIE fighters. Fortunately, one of Kryze's [[Kom'rk-class fighter|''Gauntlet''-class fighters]] arrived and the Mandalorians and rebels were able to evacuate. When the ''Gauntlet''{{'s}} weaponry jammed, Kryze and Sabine's Jedi friend [[Ezra Bridger]] donned their jet packs an engaged the two remaining fighters. Kryze and Ezra managed to destroy the two TIE fighters, allowing the rebels to escape.<ref name="Heroes of Mandalore" />

When Kryze learned that Sabine had created the "Duchess", she was enraged and chastised the younger woman for creating a weapon that would target Mandalorian armor, which she considered an abomination that only a coward would make. When Sabine explained that she had constructed the Duchess as a young and idealistic [[Imperial cadet]], Kryze reluctantly accepted her explanation. After landing at Kryze's camp, Kryze backed Sabine when she offered to atone for her role in creating the Duchess by helping to destroy it. The Mandalorians and rebels came up with a plan to infiltrate [[Governor]] [[Tiber Saxon]]'s [[Tiber Saxon's Star Destroyer|Star Destroyer]]. While one team would destroy the weapon, the other team would delete its records from the Imperial database. During the meeting, Kryze and the surviving [[Journeyman Protector]] [[Fenn Rau]] confided that Sabine had strong leadership potential.<ref name="Heroes of Mandalore" />

Kryze and the Mandalorian and rebel forces infiltrated Tiber Saxon's Star Destroyer, which was hovering above the Mandalorian capital of [[Sundari]]. Despite being spotted by Imperial sentries, Kryze and Sabine managed to make their way to the upper level, where the Duchess was being stored. However, the two were ambushed by Tiber Saxon, who electrocuted the two with the arc pulse generator. Threatening Kryze's life, Tiber forced Sabine to bring the weapon to its fullest capacity. When Saxon's [[Captain]] [[Hark]] objected to his methods, Saxon also zapped him with the Duchess. Sabine complied but then reprogrammed the Duchess to target anyone wearing [[stormtrooper armor]] including Governor Saxon.<ref name="Heroes of Mandalore" />[[File:Bo-Katan-Darksaber.png|thumb|300px|Kryze takes up the darksaber.]]Sabine swore vengeance against Saxon and toyed with killing him. However, Kryze warned Sabine that killing her enemy would make her little better than the Empire and that she should fight with true honor like a Mandalorian. Heeding the older woman, Sabine used the Darksaber to slash the arc pulse generator's power core, setting off a chain reaction that destroyed the Star Destroyer. Kryze along with the Mandalorians and rebels managed to escape to safety before the ship was destroyed.<ref name="Heroes of Mandalore" />

Upon returning to her camp, Sabine told Kryze that she had proven herself as a leader. While Kryze was uncertain, Sabine and her mother reassured her that there were people willing to follow her. The Wrens were joined by representatives from other clans including [[Clan Vizsla|Vizsla]], [[Clan Rook|Rook]], [[Clan Eldar|Eldar]], Kryze, and Fenn Rau, the last surviving Journeyman Protector. With the Wrens' approval, Kryze took the mantle of the Darksaber, [[Mandalorian resistance|rallying the support]] of Clan Wren's forces and her own Nite Owls.<ref name="Heroes of Mandalore" />

Despite her loyalty to Death Watch, Kryze had reservations concerning Maul and Opress. When Maul killed Vizsla and took the throne, Kryze refused to recognize the Sith Lord's claim to power. With the remaining Mandalorian loyalists, Kryze started a rebellion on Mandalore and attempted to liberate Satine from the royal prison.<ref name="Bo-Katan" /> Kryze believed that the enemy of her enemy was her friend,<ref name="The Lawless" /> so although she disliked the Jedi and Sith alike, Kryze joined forces with Kenobi after Maul killed Satine. The death of her sister devastated Kryze, showing she loved her sister despite any differences in ideals. She was determined to end Maul's rule of Mandalore, even if it required a Republic invasion.<ref name="Bo-Katan" />

Following the Clone Wars, Kryze became regent of Mandalore. Due to her opposition to the Empire, she was betrayed and overthrown by Clan Saxon, who aligned themselves with the Empire. Kryze regarded the arc pulse generator known as the "Duchess" as an abomination because it turned Mandalorian armor against its wearers by reacting with their [[beskar]] alloy. The fact that the weapon was named after her late sister only added insult to injury. While Kryze was initially hostile towards Sabine for her role in creating the Duchess, she respected the younger woman's willingness to atone for her actions. Kryze also became a mentor for Sabine and cautioned her against descending to the Empire's level by killing Tiber Saxon with the "Duchess".<ref name="Heroes of Mandalore" />

While Kryze believed herself unworthy to assume the Darksaber and the mantle of leadership over the Mandalorians, Sabine and her mother Ursa recognized that Kryze was a worthy leader and convinced her to take up the Darksaber. Kryze in turn also recognized that Sabine had potential for leadership.<ref name="Heroes of Mandalore" />

==Skills and abilities==
{{Quote|Take 'em out.|Kryze, commanding two of her Nite Owls|The Lawless}}
A fierce and deadly Mandalorian warrior,<ref name="SWE Bo-Katan" /> Kryze was skilled in hand-to-hand combat. She was also well-armed and was able to hold her ground against formidable opponents such as Tano<ref name="A Friend in Need" /> and Maul's super commandos.<ref name="The Lawless" /> With her skill set, Kryze led the Nite Owls, a group of Mandalorian warriors within Death Watch.<ref name="Eminence gallery" />

==Equipment==
{{Quote|You ever use one of these before?|Kryze, handing Kenobi a jetpack|The Lawless}}
[[File:Bo-katan helmet.jpg|110px|left|thumb|Bo-Katan's helmet]]
As a member of the Nite Owls, Kryze wore blue-and-white [[Mandalorian armor]], [[Mandalorian_vambrace|Mandalorian vambraces]], and a [[Z-6 jetpack]]. In combat, Kryze notably wielded dual [[WESTAR-35 blaster pistol]]s,<ref name="The Lawless" /> also utilizing dart launchers, gauntlet [[Knife|blades]],<ref name="SWE Bo-Katan" /> and a grappling line.<ref name="The Lawless" /> She also received the darksaber from Sabine Wren.<ref name="Heroes of Mandalore" />

==Behind the scenes==
Bo-Katan Kryze first appeared in "[[A Friend in Need]]," the fourteenth episode in the [[The Clone Wars: Season Four|fourth season]] of ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'', an animated television series.<ref name="A Friend in Need guide">{{SW|url=tv-shows/clone-wars/-episode-guidea-friend-in-need|text="A Friend in Need" Episode Guide - ''The Clone Wars''|archivedate=20170808173402}}</ref> In the episode, which first aired on [[January 13]], [[2012]],<ref name="Episode Guide">''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars: Episode Guide]]''</ref> Kryze is a minor character,<ref name="A Friend in Need trivia">{{SW|url=tv-shows/clone-wars/a-friend-in-need-trivia-gallery|text=A Friend in Need Trivia Gallery}}</ref> and she is voiced by [[Katee Sackhoff]], an award-winning actress best known for her role as [[Wikipedia:Kara Thrace|Kara Thrace]] in the science-fiction show ''[[Wikipedia:Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]''.<ref name="Imdb">{{Imdb|url=name/nm0755267/|text=Katee Sackhoff}}</ref> She was not included in the original script for the episode, but director [[Dave Filoni]] added her in, having plans for the character in ''The Clone Wars''{{'}} [[The Clone Wars: Season Five|fifth season]]. The name "Bo-Katan" was created by Filoni as a nod to his wife's cat. Filoni's wife, Anne, calls the cat "boogie," and Filoni derived "Bo-Katan" from "boogie-cat-Anne." Filoni also wanted Kryze to have a unique helmet design, so he created a look based on a [[Wikipedia:Barn owl|barn owl]]. For "A Friend in Need," Kryze's character sketch was finalized by [[Darren Marshall]].<ref name="A Friend in Need trivia" />

[[File:SiegeOfMandaloreConcept.png|thumb|right|200px|Kryze's story was planned to continue with the siege of Mandalore.]]
Following the season five episode "[[The Lawless]]," Kryze was set to return<ref name="Untold Tales">{{SWYoutube|lS4sclln5J4|Ahsoka's Untold Tales Panel <nowiki>|</nowiki> Star Wars Celebration Europe 2016}}</ref> in ''The Clone Wars''{{'}} finale.<ref name="Finale">{{Twitter|BFree63|status/654689846171070464|[[Brent Friedman]]|quote=It's a reference to Clone Wars' 'lost' series finale, since that arc and last night's ep were both written by @MattMichnovetz|image=File:Friedman-LostSeriesFinale.png}}</ref> However, the show was cancelled in [[2013]],<ref name="New Direction">{{SW|url=news/a-new-direction-for-lucasfilm-animation|text=A New Direction for Lucasfilm Animation|archivedate=20170718060207}}</ref> and the episode remained unfinished.<ref name="Finale" /> The episode would have focused on the siege of Mandalore, featuring Kryze and her Mandalorians aiding Ahsoka Tano and [[Captain]] Rex to free Mandalore from Darth Maul's rule. Additionally, the story would have shown Tano appointing Kryze as Mandalore's provisional leader. Although the episode was unfinished, Filoni and [[Pablo Hidalgo]] of the [[Lucasfilm Story Group]] consider certain elements to be [[canon]].<ref name="Untold Tales" /> In [[2016]], Sackhoff revealed that Kryze would return to television in the animated series ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''.<ref name="Facebook">{{FacebookCite|author=Darryl James|dateposted=2016-09-10|timeposted=|description=Katee Sackhoff at Oz Comic-Con Sydney|quote=We're at Sydney Comic Con today and heres hot actress Katee Sackhoff onstage now.
