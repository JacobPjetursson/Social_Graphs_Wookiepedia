==Biography==
[[File:ImperialsConferencing-ANH.png|thumb|250px|left|Bast attends a meeting of high-ranking Imperial officers aboard the Death Star.]]
Moradmin Bast was a [[general]] in the [[Imperial Army|ground forces]] of the [[Galactic Empire]], and he was stationed as a [[chief]]<ref name="SWCT" /> aboard the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]] during the [[Galactic Civil War]]. Early in the war, the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] was able to [[Battle of Scarif|steal]] the [[Death Star plans|plans]] to the Death Star, hoping to find a weakness in the [[battle station]] and destroy it. Bast was present in a meeting aboard the Death Star that included several high-ranking officers, including General [[Cassio Tagge]], [[Admiral]] [[Conan Antonio Motti]], [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], and the station's commander, [[Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]]. The Imperials discussed the potential threat posed by the Rebellion, and multiple opinions were expressed. Motti believed that the Rebel Alliance did not pose a threat, while Tagge expressed concerns that the Rebellion was more powerful than other Imperials realized. It was also in this meeting that the assembled officers learned that the [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]], [[Darth Sidious]], had dissolved the [[Imperial Senate]] and given direct territorial control to the regional [[Governor]]s, including Tarkin himself.<ref name="Episode IV" />

Shortly thereafter, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' was captured by the Death Star after it entered the remains of [[Alderaan]], which had been destroyed by the Death Star. The ship carried the stolen plans, along with [[Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]&mdash;Vader's former master. The crew of the ship [[Rescue of Princess Leia|rescued]] [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Organa]] from the station's prison. During the rescue, Kenobi and Vader engaged in a [[lightsaber]] duel. Kenobi allowed Vader to kill him, giving the other Rebels a chance to escape, and the Jedi Master's body [[Force spirit|disappeared]] upon being struck by [[Darth Vader's lightsaber|Vader's lightsaber]].<ref name="Episode IV" /> As the Rebels escaped, Bast approached Vader, who inspected the empty robes that Kenobi left behind. Bast asked who the man was, and Vader brushed the Jedi Master off as an old man who wrongly thought he could help gifted children.<ref name="Vader 1" />

Before the Rebels had escaped, the Empire placed a tracking device on the ''Millennium Falcon''. The Death Star followed the ship to the [[Great Temple (Yavin 4)|Great Temple]], the Rebel base on [[Yavin 4]], where Tarkin intended to use the station's [[planet]]-destroying capabilities to destroy Yavin 4 and, with it, the Rebellion. The Death Star's arrival led to the [[Battle of Yavin]], with the Rebels attacking after finding a weakness in the station's design. Imperials aboard the Death Star analyzed the Rebel attack and learned that the station could be in danger. Bast presented this information to Tarkin and asked whether the Grand Moff wanted to evacuate. Tarkin rejected the offer, chastising Bast for what Tarkin saw as the chief overestimating the chances of the Rebellion. Bast's concerns were proven correct when [[Rebel pilot]] [[Luke Skywalker]] fired a [[proton torpedo]] into one of the station's exhaust port and hit the main reactor, thanks to [[Han Solo]] showing up late in the battle. The attack set off a chain reaction within the station, and the Death Star was destroyed in a massive explosion<ref name="Episode IV" /> which killed everyone on board including Bast.<ref name="Vader 1" />

==Personality and traits==
[[File:BastTarkinEvacuate-ANH.png|thumb|250px|right|Bast asks Tarkin if the Grand Moff wishes to evacuate the Death Star.]]
Bast was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]]. He had [[Color|brown]] hair, light-colored eyes, and brown sideburns on the sides of his face. By the time of the Battle of Yavin, Bast came to see the Rebels as a potential threat to the security of the Death Star, and unsuccessfully encouraged Tarkin to leave the doomed station before its destruction.<ref name="Episode IV" />

==Behind the scenes==
Chief Bast first appeared in the [[1977]] film [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']], where he was portrayed by [[Leslie Schofield]] and credited only as "Commander #1."<ref name="Episode IV" /> One scene depicting Chief Bast was deleted from the film. In that scene, Bast provides Darth Vader with an update regarding the search for the Death Star plans on [[Tatooine]]. Vader tells Bast to send more Imperial forces to Tatooine if they are needed, as he believes finding the Death Star plans is the key to getting Princess Leia to succumb to the pressures of her interrogation aboard the Death Star and reveal the location of the Rebel base.<ref name="Blu ray">''[[Star Wars: The Complete Saga]]''</ref> Footage of the scene was used, with its dialogue altered, in [[1978]] for ''[[The Star Wars Holiday Special]]''.<ref name="Holiday Special">''[[The Star Wars Holiday Special]]''</ref> The scene was released in [[2011]] as part of the ''[[Star Wars: The Complete Saga]]'' Blu-ray set.<ref name="Blu ray" />
