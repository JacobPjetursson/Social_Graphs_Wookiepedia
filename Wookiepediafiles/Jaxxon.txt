'''Jaxxon''', nicknamed '''Jax''', was a [[Sexes|male]] [[smuggler]] who belonged to a [[rabbit]]-like [[Sentience|sentient]] [[species]]. He was an acquaintance of [[Han Solo]], a fellow smuggler turned hero of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]], whom he regarded as an inferior [[pilot]].<ref name="TEOL" />

==Biography==
At some point during the [[Galactic Civil War]], Jaxxon and the [[pirate]] [[Amaiza Foxtrain]] were hired by [[Prizzi]], [[Queen]] of [[Livorno]], to safely deliver the last [[egg]]s of her kind to [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Organa]] of the Rebel Alliance. Once aboard the smuggler's [[starship]] the ''[[Rabbit's Foot]]'', Jaxxon and the queen realized that the eggs were not hers when they hatched, revealing hostile flying creatures. It turned out that Foxtrain had double-crossed him, slipping away with the real eggs.<ref name="TEOL" />

Nevertheless, Jaxxon managed to track her to the [[Realspace|space]]-bound [[casino]] known as [[the Wheel]], where the pirate was trying to sell the purloined eggs to the highest bidder. There followed a three-sided scuffle between Jaxxon, Foxtrain, and an [[agent]] of the [[Galactic Empire]]. Having released the flying pests from earlier on his former associate, the long-eared smuggler got away with the eggs. He then brought the precious cargo to Leia Organa and Han Solo.<ref name="TEOL" />

Upon receiving Organa's thanks, Jaxxon asked his droid [[ML-08|Mel]] to bring forth the eggs, which the robot accidentally dropped. While all reacted in shock, Jaxxon knew that he had been sent on wild goose chase, and that those eggs were fake as well. The Rebels then admitted that, knowing the Empire were closing in on the eggs, they used Jaxxon's mission as a decoy while Solo smuggled the genuine articles in his [[Millennium Falcon|own ship]]. Nevertheless, Jaxxon was glad to learn that not only the Alliance would pay him what he was owed, but that Solo himself would have to repair his ship.<ref name="TEOL" />

==Personality and traits==
With his long ears, large pair of buck teeth, and short green fur, Jaxxon resembled a common rabbit, which owed him epithets such as "cottontail" or "green-ears." He was lanky and tall,<ref name="TEOL" /> measuring over 1.80 [[meter]]s.<ref name="Height" />
He was fond of [[dewback]] [[Dewback steak|steaks]].<ref name="TEOL" />

==Equipment==
Jaxxon wore a red jumpsuit with yellow stripes down the front, armored shoulders, white gloves and tall white boots. He carried two [[blaster pistol]]s at his hips.<ref name="TEOL" />

==Behind the scenes==
Jaxxon made his debut in ''[[Star Wars 8: Eight for Aduba-3]]'', a [[1977]] comic written by [[Roy Thomas]] and illustrated by [[Howard Chaykin]]. It was the eighth issue in the ''[[Star Wars (Marvel)|Marvel Star Wars]]'' series of comics, and the second original ''[[Star Wars]]'' comic story.<ref name="Eight for Aduba-3">''[[Star Wars 8: Eight for Aduba-3]]''</ref> He made additional appearances in the [[Star Wars 9: Showdown on a Wasteland World!|ninth]],<ref name="Showdown on a Wasteland World">''[[Star Wars 9: Showdown on a Wasteland World!]]''</ref> [[Star Wars 10: Behemoth from the World Below|tenth]],<ref name="Behemoth from the World Below">''[[Star Wars 10: Behemoth from the World Below]]''</ref> [[Star Wars 11: Star Search!|eleventh]],<ref name="Star Search">''[[Star Wars 11: Star Search!]]''</ref> and [[Star Wars 16: The Hunter|sixteenth]] issues of the series,<ref name="The Hunter">''[[Star Wars 16: The Hunter]]''</ref> and also had a cameo in ''[[The Clone Wars: Invitation Only]]'', a short webcomic written by [[Pablo Hidalgo]] that was published in [[2009]].<ref name="Invitation Only">''[[The Clone Wars: Invitation Only]]''</ref> However, those stories are part of the [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] continuity, formerly known as the "Expanded Universe," and therefore are no longer [[canon]] as of the [[2014]] reboot.<ref name="EUNewPage">{{SW|url=news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page.html|text=The Legendary Star Wars Expanded Universe Turns a New Page}}</ref>

Nevertheless, he would enter the new ''Star Wars'' canon through his appearance in "[[The Lost Eggs of Livorno]]," a short comic penned by [[Cavan Scott]] and illustrated by [[Alain Mauricet]] that was published as the secondary story of ''[[Star Wars Adventures Annual 2018]]'' on [[April 18]], [[2018]].<ref name="Cavan Scott">[http://cavanscott.com/2018/04/02/jaxxon-lives-a-special-easter-present-from-star-wars-adventures/ Jaxxon lives – A special Easter present from Star Wars Adventures]</ref>

Even prior to his canonization, there were nods to Jaxxon in the post-reboot era. As early as 2014, [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Star Wars (Marvel 2015)|Star Wars]]'' writer [[Jason Aaron]] mentioned the "giant bunny rabbit" as the Legends character he would most like to canonize.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/comics/2014/7/27/22972/sdcc_2014_star_wars|title=SDCC 2014: Star Wars|work=Marvel.com|first=Jim|last=Beard|date=2014-07-27|accessdate=2014-07-27}}</ref> Jaxxon was also featured on several variant covers, including one of ''[[Star Wars 1: Skywalker Strikes]]'', produced by artist [[John Tyler Christopher]],<ref>{{SW|url=news/star-wars-1-party-variant-with-jaxxon-exclusive|text=''Star Wars'' #1 Party Variant with Jaxxon – Exclusive!}}</ref> one of ''[[Vader Down, Part I]]'', made by [[Chip Zdarsky]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/zdarsky-brings-jaxxon-to-star-wars-vader-down-variant-cover|title=Zdarsky brings Jaxxon to "Star Wars: Vader Down" Variant Cover|date=2015-10-20|publisher=Comic Book Resources}}</ref> and one of ''[[Poe Dameron 1: Black Squadron, Part I]]'', illustrated by [[David Nakayama]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coffeewithkenobi.com/star-wars-poe-dameron-1-comes-to-comic-shops-with-an-epic-celebration/|title=STAR WARS: POE DAMERON #1 Comes to Comic Shops With an Epic Celebration!|last=Dullard|first=Lisa|work=Coffee With Kenobi|date=2016-03-01|accessdate=2016-03-17}}</ref> In ''[[The Force Awakens, Part III]]'', the third issue of the six-part [[Star Wars: The Force Awakens Adaptation|adapation]] of [[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']], a [[Unidentified humanoid rabbit|humanoid rabbit]] was seen from the back during a crowd scene at [[Maz Kanata]]'s [[Maz Kanata's castle|castle]].<ref name="Comic">''[[The Force Awakens, Part III]]''</ref>

On [[March 19]], 2018, a character resembling Jaxxon was seen on [[Ord Mantell]] in "[[Bounty Hunted]]," the sixth episode the canon animated micro-series ''[[Star Wars: Forces of Destiny]]''{{'}} second season.<ref name="Bounty Hunted">{{FOD|Bounty Hunted}}</ref> The same model was used again in the episode "[[Triplecross]]".<ref name="Triplecross">{{FOD|Triplecross}}</ref>
