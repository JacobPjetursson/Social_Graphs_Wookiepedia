{{Quote|If you have a drink in your hand, you don't need me for nothing.|Wuher|We Don't Serve Their Kind Here}}
'''Wuher''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] from [[Tatooine]] who worked as a [[bartender]] at [[Chalmun's Cantina]].<ref name="ANH" />

He strongly [[Anti-droid sentiment|disliked]] [[droid]]s and installed a [[droid detector]] in the [[cantina]] to keep them out.<ref name="theirkind">{{Shortstory|story=We Don't Serve Their Kind Here|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref> Despite this, [[Luke Skywalker]] and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] entered with the droids [[C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2]]. Upon noticing their presence, he ordered that the droids would have to wait outside.<ref name="ANH" />

Some time afterwards, [[Boba Fett]] arrived at the cantina and asked for the identity and name of Luke Skywalker. After torturing an [[Unidentified six-armed alien|alien]], Wuher told Fett that he and the patrons didn't know the identity or name of the boy he was searching for.<ref name="Star Wars 5">''[[Star Wars 5: Skywalker Strikes, Part V]]''</ref>

Wuher disliked the concept of [[slavery]], feeling that nobody should have to be a slave. He himself could have had an easier [[time]] in his work at Chalmun's Cantina by purchasing slaves, but decided against it. He disliked [[bounty hunter]]s for similar reasons, but could not refuse their patronage for fear of what it would do to his reputation. His abiding dislike of droids stemmed from the [[death]] of his [[parent]]s at the hands of [[battle droid]]s [[Battle on Arkax Station|during]] the [[Clone Wars]]. He had great respect, however, for [[Jedi]], who saved him from an entire [[battalion]] of droids. His nightly ritual was to go home and drink a glass of [[blue milk]] to settle his [[stomach]].<ref name="theirkind" />

==Behind the scenes==
Wuher was portrayed by British actor [[Ted Burnett]] in ''[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|A New Hope]]''.<ref name="ANH" /> However, his dialog was dubbed with the voice of another actor.{{Source?}}

The character was known only as "The Bartender" at the time of the film's release, but the [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] source ''[[Mos Eisley Adventure Set]]'' gave the character's name as "Cedo Partu." The character was later renamed as "Wuher."<ref name="DB">{{DB|character|wuher|Wuher}}</ref> The new name was later confirmed as part of the [[canon]] continuity established on [[April 25]], [[2014]]<ref name="End of EU">{{SW|url=/news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page.html|text=The Legendary Star Wars Expanded Universe Turns a New Page}}</ref> in the reference book ''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''.<ref name="USW" />
