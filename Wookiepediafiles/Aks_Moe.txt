==Biography==
[[File:Malastare Delagates TPM.png|left|thumb|200px|Moe addresses the senate]]
Aks Moe served as the [[Senator|representative]] for the [[Congress of Malastare]] in the [[Galactic Senate]] during the waning [[Standard year|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic]]. After a dispute over the taxation of trade routes to outlying [[star system]]s, the droid armies of the [[Trade Federation]] [[Invasion of Naboo|invaded]] the [[planet]] [[Naboo]]. Hoping to receive help from the Republic's government, [[Monarch of Naboo|Queen]] [[Padmé Amidala]] of Naboo addressed the Senate and explained that the Federation had invaded her world. [[Lott Dod]], the senator for the Trade Federation, strenuously objected to the claims and recommended that a commission to be sent to Naboo to ascertain the truth of the queen's claims. Moe supported Dodd's recommendation to have a commission be sent. Having little faith in the bureaucracies of the Senate, Amidala instead called for a [[Vote of No Confidence]] against [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Finis Valorum]]. Senator [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] of Naboo was elected in his place, and Amidala led a [[Battle of Naboo|battle]] against the Federation that liberated her world.<ref name="Episode I" />

Some [[time]] later, Moe was [[assassin]]ated and replaced by a fellow Gran senator, [[Ask Aak]].<ref name="Helmet Collection 1" />
