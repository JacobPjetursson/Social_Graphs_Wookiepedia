{{Quote|I PERFORMED VIOLENCE. ROGER-ROGER.|Mister Bones, to Temmin Wexley|Aftermath}}
'''Mister Bones''', also simply referred to as '''Bones''', was a heavily modified [[B1 battle droid]] with a murderous personality. He was constructed by [[Temmin Wexley]] and built from components the boy [[Scavenger|scavenged]] from the catacombs beneath [[Myrra]], the [[capital]] [[city]] of [[Akiva]]. Bones served as Temmin's personal bodyguard in addition to being considered his friend and loyal companion. He had a sadistic personality and would sing or hum while attacking and maiming his victims. After Temmin reunited with his mother, [[Norra Wexley]], Temmin joined the nascent [[New Republic]] and helped Norra and her team hunt down Imperial war criminals.

Mister Bones continued serving Temmin a year after the [[Battle of Endor]]. When [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Organa]] enlisted the services of Norra and her team in finding her husband, [[Han Solo]], Bones accompanied them to [[Irudiru]] and later [[Kashyyyk]]. He took part in the liberation of the [[Ashmead's Lock]] prisoners which included Temmin's father, [[Brentin Lore Wexley]]. Bones continued supporting his master Temmin during the lead-up to the [[Attack on Chandrila|attack]] on [[Chandrila]]. Following the attacks, Bones accompanied Temmin and Norra's team in their hunt for the Imperial [[Grand Admiral]] [[Rae Sloane]].

At the request of Temmin, Mister Bones followed the boy's mother to Jakku. He rescued her from an Imperial labor camp. After reuniting with [[Jas Emari]], Bones escorted the two women on their hunt for Grand Admiral Sloane. During the [[Battle of Jakku]], Bones along with Norra joined forces with Sloane and Brentin to stop [[Counselor to the Empire|Counselor]] [[Gallius Rax]] from detonating both Jakku and the New Republic and Imperial forces. Bones later separated from Norra's party and reunited with Temmin during the battle. He saved the boy from several Imperial [[stormtrooper]]s but was permanently disintegrated in a friendly-fire incident by two [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor|A-wings]].

==Biography==

===Origins===
{{Quote|No, you [Norra] don't get it. He built Mister Bones the year you left. Temmin doesn't have many friends. That droid might be it.''"<br>"''You can't be friends with a droid.''"<br>"''Well, he is. Temmin was getting taunted and beaten by a gang of... young tyrants. Bones protected him. He's not just a bodyguard.|Esmelle and Norra discussing Mister Bones' relationship with Temmin|Aftermath}}
[[File:Teenage Snap Wexley.png|left|225px|thumb|A teenage Temmin Wexley, Mister Bones' creator and companion]]
[[Temmin Wexley]] built Mister Bones using spare parts [[Sexes|he]] had scavenged from a [[Akiva droid factory|former]] [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist]] [[factory]] in [[Myrra]] city on the planet [[Akiva]] about three [[Standard year|years]] before the [[Battle of Endor]]. Since Temmin had no friends and was bullied by his peers. Bones became a close friend to the adolescent [[human]] boy, whose [[Parent|father]], [[Brentin Lore Wexley|Brentin]], had been taken away by the [[Galactic Empire]] and whose mother, [[Norra Wexley|Norra]], had left him to join the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebellion]]. Norra had left Temmin in the care of his aunt [[Esmelle]] and her wife [[Shirene]]. However, Temmin's aunts proved to be unable to manage him. By the age of fifteen, Temmin had moved back to his [[Wexley family|family]] home, which he converted into a junk shop. Unable to turn to his family, Temmin came to treat Bones as his best friend.<ref name="Aftermath" />

===Protecting Master Temmin===
{{Quote|Bones. Pull the speeder around back. We need to load these slime-guzzling Hutt-mothers up and you need to fly them out as far as you can along the Trabzon Road, I'm talking all the way to the Kora Biedies... You hear me, Bones?''"<br>"''ROGER-ROGER. BODIES BEGONE, MASTER|Temmin and Mister Bones|Aftermath}}
Since Temmin's line of work brought him into contact with underworld elements, Bones served as the boy's personal bodyguard. Shortly after the Battle of [[Endor]], Temmin activated Mister Bones in order to deal with three [[gangster]]s: the [[Abednedo (species)|Abednedo]] [[Toomata Wree]], the [[Ithorian]] [[Herf (Ithorian)|Herf]], and the [[Koorivar]] [[Makarial Gravin]], who served as enforcers for the [[Sullustan]] gangster [[Surat Nuat]]. Temmin had stolen supplies from one of Surat's wrecked [[transport]]s and the gangsters had come to punish the boy for his perceived insolence. After the gangsters demanded that he hand over his store and livelihood, Temmin ordered Bones to attack the gangsters.<ref name="Aftermath" />

Using his [[vibroblade]], Bones destroyed Herf's [[DLT cannon]] and then slammed the Ithorian into Tooms. The [[droid]] then pounded Herf and Toom's heads together, knocking them out. Makarial then attempted to force Temmin's surrender by pointing a [[blaster]] at the boy's head. However, Temmin's repurposed [[IT-O Interrogation Unit|interrogator droid]] injected a [[Poison|toxic]] narcotic, which incapacitated the Koorivar. Shortly, Norra entered the house. After embracing his mother, Temmin ordered Bones to dump the gangsters' bodies at the intersection of [[Trabzon Road]] and the [[Kora Biedies]] river. While humming a tune, the droid left Temmin and his mother to sort out their problems.<ref name="Aftermath" />

Mister Bones proved unsuccessful in carrying out his task and at least one of the gangsters, Tooms, escaped. Surat's gangsters managed to deactivate Mister Bones and place him in storage mode. The gangsters placed the deactivated Bones in an ion field. After escaping his mother, Temmin returned to the storehouse only to discover that Bones was immobilized. He was then captured by Surat's lackeys including a potbellied [[Rodian]] and an oil-skinned [[Herglic]]. The immobilized Mister Bones along with Temmin were taken back to Surat's lair.<ref name="Aftermath" />

Later, Temmin was rescued by the [[bounty hunter]] [[Jas Emari]] and the former Imperial [[loyalty officer]] [[Sinjir Rath Velus]]. During the struggle, Temmin reactivated Mister Bones, who then attacked several Imperial [[stormtrooper]]s and Surat's henchmen. He quickly [[Death|killed]] the stormtroopers and their [[Imperial officer|officer]] with his vibroblade. Bones' intervention allowed Temmin, Jas, and Sinjir to escape in Norra's [[bala-bala]] [[speeder]]. Bones survived the skirmish but was seriously damaged and lost his non-vibroblade arm.<ref name="Aftermath" />

Despite the serious damage, Bones managed to limp to Esmelle's house, where his master Temmin and his rescuers were seeking refuge. Upon greeting his master, Bones short-circuited and broke down. Temmin quickly set about repairing his companion, using spare parts he had salvaged from Esmelle's basement workshop. Due to the scarce materials, Temmin was forced to improvise by replacing Bones' missing arm with an [[astromech droid]]'s [[Ambulatory strut|leg]]. Regarding astromech droids as inferior, Bones whined about his "non-arm." Temmin assured his droid that he would repair him as soon as they returned to the shop. Despite losing his vibroblade arm, Mister Bones vowed to continue serving his master. Temmin also thanked his droid for coming back.<ref name="Aftermath" />

===Uprising on Akiva===
{{Quote|PERHAPS I CAN STILL BE FUNCTIONAL. I CAN BLUDGEON THOSE WHO WOULD HURT YOU. I WILL BEAT THEM TO A GREASY TREACLE-PASTE. DO NOT WORRY, MASTER TEMMIN. YOU ARE SAFE.|Mister Bones after being fitted with an astromech droid leg|Aftermath}}
[[File:Norra Wexley.png|right|thumb|225px|Norra, Temmin's mother]]
Mister Bones later followed his Master Temmin, who reluctantly agreed to helped his mother, the bounty hunter Jas Emari, and the former Imperial Sinjir rescue the [[New Republic]] [[starfighter]] [[pilot]] [[Wedge Antilles]] from Imperial captivity at [[Satrap]] [[Isstra Dirus]]'s [[Satrap's Palace|palace]]. Following the Battle of Endor, the Galactic Empire had descended into chaos and turmoil with the deaths of [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] and [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] aboard the [[Death Star II|second Death Star]]. The Rebel Alliance had established a new galactic government called the New Republic. While on a scouting [[Mission to Akiva|mission]] above Akiva, Wedge had been captured by [[Admiral]] [[Rae Sloane]]. Several leading Imperials had convened an [[Imperial Future Council]] to [[Emergency summit on Akiva|discuss]] the fate of the Empire. Norra wanted to rescue Wedge and inspire the people of Akiva to revolt against the Empire.<ref name="Aftermath" />

Part of Norra's plan involved seizing control of an Imperial communications station. After Sinjir had bluffed his way into the building, Bones stormed the building and used both his vibroblade and astromech leg arms to kill a few stormtroopers. Bones then recorded a faux recording of Sinjir, dressed as an Imperial officer, shooting Temmin dead. This was part of a propaganda broadcast that Norra transmitted to the people of Akiva. This had the effect of inspiring a popular uprising on the planet. After finishing the broadcast, Bones killed a [[moth]] with his vibroblade arm.<ref name="Aftermath" />

After uploading their broadcast, Bones and his companions fled to the roof only to be cornered by two [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]]. At Temmin's command, Bones cannonballed himself into the windscreen of a TIE fighter. Temmin's mother, Norra, destroyed the other TIE with a stolen fighter. Later, Mister Bones turned up at the [[cantina]] [[Pok's Place]] with his master. Despite being battered and losing several of his little osseous accoutrements, the [[battle droid]] was still intact and operational. Shortly afterward, Norra turned up, having survived a failed attack on the satrap's palace. Bones was relieved that Norra had survived and expressed his delight that her existence had not been reduced to "scattered atoms."<ref name="Aftermath" />

Later, Bones followed his master and their companions back to Temmin's shop. He followed Temmin into his "hidey-hole nook-and-cubby." There, Temmin attempted to make peace with Surat by offering Sinjir and Jas to the Empire in return for obtaining safe passage for himself, his mum, and Mister Bones offworld. Surat agreed to the deal but secretly arranged with Admiral Sloane to arrest Norra, who was a New Republic pilot. After returning to the shop, Norra put her plan to rescue Wedge into action. Using Temmin's knowledge of the underground [[Catacombs of Akiva|catacombs]] beneath Myrra, the rebels and Bones traveled to the satrap's palace. During the journey, Bones hummed and sang, prompting his master to explain his programming to Sinjir.<ref name="Aftermath" />

After escaping several [[Uugteen]] savages inhabiting a former Separatist droid factory, Temmin led the travelers up the old [[InterGalactic Banking Clan|Banking Clan]] building, which was near the satrap's palace. Upon arriving outside the palace, the companions were ambushed and captured by Imperial stormtroopers led by Admiral Sloane. Once inside the palace, Temmin demanded that the Empire and Surat honor their deal. However, Surat revealed that he had made another deal with the Empire. Temmin was allowed to leave but Norra was arrested by Admiral Sloane.<ref name="Aftermath" />

Temmin protested and called on Bones to save them. However, Sloane's stormtroopers shot the droid down with their blasters. Sloane herself personally emptied six blaster bolts into the droid's head, decapitating Mister Bones. With the droid disintegrated, she ordered her men to throw Temmin off the roof and to take the other [[prisoner]]s aboard the [[Slavery|slave]] trader [[Arsin Crassus]]'s [[yacht]] ''[[Golden Harp]]''. However, Temmin survived and managed to free his mother, Sinjir, and Jas Emari. Soon, a [[New Republic Defense Fleet|New Republic fleet]] arrived and [[Rebellion on Akiva|liberated]] the planet.<ref name="Aftermath" />

===Joining the New Republic===
{{Quote|Sorry. He's trying to learn how to be more... human? And less...''"<br>"''Singing, dancing murder-bot?|Snap Wexley introduces Mister Bones to Wedge Antilles|Aftermath: Life Debt}}
[[File:New Republic canon.svg|left|200px|thumb|Mister Bones followed Temmin into the New Republic]]
Following the Battle of Akiva, Temmin and Norra rebuilt Mister Bones from scrap in Esmelle and Shirene's basement as a "family project" to make up for the years of separation. While Bones was now able to walk, he left craters in his wake. Bones then joined Temmin, Norra, Sinjir, Jas Emari, and the [[New Republic soldier]] [[Jom Barell]] in hunting down Imperial [[Galactic Civil War|war]] criminals.<ref name="Aftermath" /> Mister Bones stayed aboard Emari's gunship ''[[Halo]]'' with Temmin during a mission to kidnap the Imperial [[Rear Admiral]] [[Perwin Gedde]] from [[Slussen Urla-fir Kal Kethin-wa Canker|Slussen Canker's]] [[Slussen Canker's palace|palace]] on [[Vorlag]]. Temmin was serving as the team's getaway pilot.<ref name="Life Debt">''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]''</ref>

While waiting to pick up Norra and the rest of the team, Bones boasted about eradicating their adversaries and turning them into fine red mist. Temmin picked up Norra's team and the fugitive Rear Admiral. Mister Bones accompanied Temmin and the rest of the team back to [[Hanna City]] on Chandrila. After handing Gedde over to the New Republic authorities, Bones accompanied Temmin to a starfighter lesson organized by [[Captain]] Wedge Antilles, who had become his master's mentor. Bones gave Wedge an uncomfortable hug before dancing around [[Landing Platform OB-99]] in dramatic swoops, plies, and pirouettes.<ref name="Life Debt" />

Later, Mister Bones was present at a meeting organized by Norra to discuss the poisoning of Rear-Admiral Gedde and [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Organa]]'s request to rescue her husband, [[Han Solo]]. When Sinjir informed the group that Leia was [[Kylo Ren|pregnant]], Mister Bones began signing a song about the pregnancy until Sinjir told him to stop. Mister Bones and his master Temmin stayed behind on Chandrila while Norra and Wedge departed on an unauthorized mission to the last known coordinates of Han Solo in [[Wild Space]]. In Bones' absence, Norra and Wedge came under attack from Imperial forces but were rescued by New Republic ships.<ref name="Life Debt" />

After Norra returned to Chandrila, Mister Bones and the rest of the team attended a meeting with Admiral [[Gial Ackbar|Ackbar]], Princess Leia, and Wedge Antilles in the [[Skygarden]] above the [[Polis District]] of Hanna City. While the others talked, Mister Bones chased a butterfly and ripped off its wings. When Admiral Ackbar ordered Norra and her team to cease searching for Solo and to resume their hunt for Imperial fugitives, Norra resigned from the New Republic Starfleet in protest. Mister Bones and Norra's team subsequently departed on their mission to find and rescue Han.<ref name="Life Debt" />

===Mission to Kashyyyk===
{{Quote|Attacked by a droid. A... An old Clone Wars battle droid of all things. I must be hallucin...|Han Solo, of his encounter with Mister Bones|Aftermath: Life Debt}}
[[File:Kashyyk Ghost Raid.png|right|thumb|225px|Kashyyyk, the enslaved Wookiee homeworld]]
Mister Bones accompanied Temmin and Norra's team on a mission to track down the [[Siniteen]] prison architect [[Golas Aram]] on the planet [[Irudiru]] on the edge of Wild Space. Aram was privy to information on an automated Imperial prison on the [[Wookiee]] homeworld of [[Kashyyyk]] called [[Ashmead's Lock]]. While surveying Aram's compound, Temmin and Norra's team encountered Han Solo. Later, Mister Bones accosted Han Solo at a nearby cantina, having mistaken him for a threat. However, he was stopped by Temmin and the rest of the team, who reassured him that Solo was a friend.<ref name="Life Debt" />

Since Han wanted to rescue his Wookiee friend [[Chewbacca]] from Ashmead's Lock, the rebels teamed up with the former [[smuggler]] to storm Aram's compound. Bones and Temmin aided the mission by cutting the conduit from the wind farm that powered Aram's fence and turrets. After capturing Aram, Sinjir interrogated the Siniteen and learned about the prison's layout. The rebels traveled with Han to Kashyyyk. After passing through the Imperial blockade, Mister Bones and his comrades entered Ashmead's Lock. They were immediately confronted by the prison's computer system [[Synthesized Operating Layer, Grid-Based Drive Array|SOL-GDA]], which demanded that they yielded the password. When the rebels failed to supply the password, SOL-GDA dispatched security droids to "incorporate" them.<ref name="Life Debt" />

Amidst the chaos, Mister Bones began using his vibroblade to saw through various objects including a door. Temmin roused the battle droid by appealing to his lust for violence and danger. Mister Bones used his vibroblades to slash at the security droids, destroying several in the process. Bones fought his way into the chamber containing the stasis cells where the prisoners were being held. Despite losing one arm and twisting one of his metallic legs, Bones fought his way to free Norra, who had been captured by several droids. At that moment, Jas Emari disabled the cable connecting the stasis cells to the computer system, deactivating SOL-GDA.<ref name="Life Debt" />

Norra's team and Han then freed a hundred prisoners including Chewbacca and Temmin's father, Brentin. Mister Bones accompanied Temmin, Norra, and the liberated prisoners back to Chandrila on Solo's freighter, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. Meanwhile, Jom, Sinjir, and Jas stayed behind with Han and Chewbacca to liberate the Wookiees from Imperial rule. Once aboard, Mister Bones urged Temmin to hug his father but advised them not to squeeze each other too hard. By that stage, Temmin had repaired Mister Bones using supplies from the ''Falcon''.<ref name="Life Debt" />

===Standing by Temmin===
{{Quote|I'm good, Bones, I'm fine. Happy to have Dad home.''"<br>"''THAT'S NICE. BUT IT DOES NOT EXPLAIN THE UPSET YOU ARE DEMONSTRATING ON YOUR FACE. YOUR GRIEF AND WORRY HAVE BEEN ONGOING. EXPLAIN, PLEASE.|Mister Bones|Aftermath: Life Debt}}
[[File:A New Dawn-SWP.jpg|left|225px|thumb|Mister Bones was caught up in the attack on Chandrila]]
In the month following the events at Ashmead's Lock, Mister Bones continued serving his master Temmin as the boy struggled to repair his relationship with Brentin. Still traumatized by his incarceration, Brentin struggled to reconnect with his son and wife. Frustrated, Temmin made life difficult for his mother, Norra, and stopped attending X-wing starfighter lessons. Despite his slapstick humor, Mister Bones was perceptive enough to sense that Temmin was upset about his father. On one occasion, Bones was present when Temmin argued with his mother. After Temmin threw his dish into the sink, Bones volunteered to clean up after his master. Loyal to his programming, Bones accompanied his master on a long walk.<ref name="Life Debt" />

Later, Mister Bones stayed at the Wexley family home while Temmin went on an evening walk with his dad. During the walk, Temmin discovered his father meeting with the [[Senate Guard (New Republic)|New Republic Senate Guard]] [[Windom Traducier]], who was an agent of the Imperial [[Fleet Admiral]] [[Gallius Rax]]. Rax had installed inorganic bio-chips into the heads of the Ashmead's Lock prisoners, including Brentin. The Fleet Admiral wanted to use the prisoners to assassinate New Republic leaders including [[Chancellor (New Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Mon Mothma]]. Under the orders of Rax, Traducier had used a transponder to summon the former prisoners and outfitted them with concealed blasters for the assassination attempt. When Temmin discovered the conspiracy, Brentin stunned him and flung him inside a crate.<ref name="Life Debt" />

The following day, Mister Bones went to find his master, mistaking his disappearance for a hide-and-seek game. Bones found Temmin and rescued him from the crate. Temmin then told Bones that they had to find his mother, Norra, and warn her. By that stage, the Liberation Day celebrations were under way. To promote the New Republic to prospective member worlds, Chancellor Mothma had made the former Ashmead's Lock prisoners the stars of the Liberation Day celebrations. She planned to give a speech in the presence of the former prisoners that would be broadcast live on [[HoloNet]]. The Liberation Day celebrations were intended to precede the upcoming [[Imperial-Republic peace talks]] with [[Grand Admiral]] Rae Sloane.<ref name="Life Debt" />

Mister Bones and Temmin headed to the [[Old Gather-House]], where the Liberation Day speech was scheduled to take place. However, they were blocked by several Senate Guards, who ordered them to leave. When one of the guards waved a [[shock-lance]] at Temmin, Bones reacted instinctively and knocked the guard to the ground. At that point, the Ashmead's Lock prisoners began opening fire on Chancellor Mothma and other New Republic officials and dignitaries. When another Senate Guard tackled and hit Temmin with a baton, Bones flung him aside and then took on two more Guards with his vibroblades.<ref name="Life Debt" />

Amidst the chaos, Brentin regained control of his mind but fled offworld. The New Republic authorities managed to reestablish control, but the attacks had weakened public enthusiasm for the New Republic. While Mon Mothma survived, several other New Republic officials including [[General]] [[Crix Madine]] and the Adviser [[Hostis Ij]] were rumored to be dead. Following the [[attack on Chandrila]], Bones accompanied his master Temmin, Norra, Sinjir, and Jas Emari on a mission to hunt down Grand Admiral Sloane, who they mistakenly believed was the mastermind behind the attack on Chandrila. For that mission, they received the personal and financial blessing of Princess Leia, who was grateful for their help.<ref name="Life Debt" />

===Protecting Norra===
{{Quote|Launch and get to Jakku. Find Mom. Protect Mom!|Temmin Wexley's last command to Mister Bones|Aftermath: Empire's End}}
[[File:Jakku - full - SW Poe Dameron Flight Log .png|right|200px|thumb|Mister Bones ended up on the planet Jakku]]
For the next several months, Mister Bones accompanied his master Temmin and Norra's team on their hunt for Grand Admiral Sloane. Their travels took them to Kashyyyk, [[Ord Mantell]], [[Corellia]], and [[Jindau Station]]. Norra and her team eventually decided to hunt down the bounty hunter [[Mercurial Swift]], who had dealings with Sloane. While Norra's team [[Capture of Mercurial Swift|trapped]] Mercurial Swift on [[Taris]], Mister Bones and Temmin manned Norra's freighter ''Moth''. Though Bones did not mind guarding the ship, Temmin was unhappy at being left behind and did not understand that his mother was trying to protect him.<ref name="Empire's End" />

After Mercurial Swift revealed that Sloane and an unidentified man had traveled to the [[Inner Rim]] planet of [[Jakku]], Norra's team set a course for the remote planet. Upon exiting hyperspace, Norra's team discovered that the Imperial remnants had gathered above Jakku. The ''Moth'' was attacked by several TIE fighters. After Norra and Jas Emari abruptly departed in the freighter's [[escape pod]] to continue their hunt for Sloane, Temmin sent Mister Bones down in a second escape pod to protect his mother at any cost. Since Norra had set the ''Moth''{{'s}} [[hyperdrive]] to jump into hyperspace in two minutes, Temmin and Sinjir traveled back to Chandrila to warn the New Republic that the Empire was hiding on Jakku.<ref name="Empire's End" />

Mister Bones survived his landing on Jakku. However, Norra and Jas were captured by Imperial forces. Norra was forced to work at a [[kesium gas]] rig while Jas was taken captive by the local [[Hutt]] [[crime lord|crime lady]] [[Niima]]. Mister Bones found Norra and Jas' escape pod but was captured by a stormtrooper, who fitted him with a [[restraining bolt]]. The stormtrooper's officer [[Effney]] ordered that Bones be brought to General [[Hodnar Borrum]] aboard the ''[[Ravager]]''. Before the stormtrooper could take Mister Bones away, Norra claimed that Bones was her droid.<ref name="Empire's End" />

She demanded that the Imperials release her and her droid. However, Effney grabbed the blaster from his subordinate and blasted Mister Bones to shreds. Effney then left the wreckage of Mister Bones on the floor in order to break Norra's spirit. However, Mister Bones' memory matrix had been programmed to reboot itself. After experiencing memories of the [[Clone Wars]], Mister Bones remembered Temmin's last set of commands. Bones activated his [[autonomic repair mode]] and his body parts began reassembling themselves. After repairing himself, Mister Bones attacked the stormtroopers and Effney. As revenge for Effney's cruel disintegration, Bones cut off his arm and then ripped the Imperial officer to shreds, killing him. Mister Bones then freed Norra from her cage.<ref name="Empire's End" />

===Resuming the hunt===
{{Quote|HELLO. I AM ENJOYING THIS HUG, TOO. HUG HUG HUG. A HUG IS LIKE VIOLENCE MADE OF LOVE.|Mister Bones hugging Norra and Jas|Aftermath: Empire's End}}
[[File:Grand Admiral Sloane.png|left|200px|thumb|Mister Bones took part in the hunt for Grand Admiral Sloane]]
After freeing the other prisoners at the kesium rig, Bones and Norra stole a [[speeder bike]] and traveled through the deserts of Jakku. After traveling for several hours, they encountered Jas, who had freed herself from her captors and commandeered an Imperial shuttle. While the two women toyed with the idea of returning to Chandrila since the shuttle had the proper clearance codes, they decided to stay after learning that Sloane was traveling with Niima the Hutt to a [[Jakku Observatory|mysterious facility]] in the [[Plaintive Hand plateau]]. After hugging Norra and Jas, Bones continued the journey with them.<ref name="Empire's End" />

During the journey, Niima's caravan was attacked by [[turbolaser]]s from the mysterious Imperial facility. The attack had been ordered by [[Counselor to the Empire]] Gallius Rax, the true architect behind the Attack on Chandrila who had usurped Sloane's leadership of the Imperial remnants. Bones and his companions traveled on their shuttle towards the valley below the Plaintive Hand plateau, where the survivors had gathered. Before they could capture Sloane and her companion Brentin, Gallius Rax arrived with three shuttles and took Sloane and Brentin prisoner.<ref name="Empire's End" />

Despite this setback, Norra's team found an unlikely ally in the form of Niima. In return for bring the wounded Hutt back to her headquarters, Niima agreed to give them the clearance codes needed to enter Gallius Rax's [[Main Imperial base|Imperial base]], where Sloane and Brentin were held. Niima also furnished them with an old Imperial [[shuttle]] and old Imperial uniforms. However, none of the uniforms fit the seasoned battle droid. Before they could leave, Jas was cornered by the bounty hunters Mercurial Swift, [[Embo]], [[Dengar]], and the Rodian [[Jeeta]]. While Jas distracted the bounty hunters, Bones and Norra departed on the shuttle for the Imperial base. Their departure coincided with the beginning of the climatic [[Battle of Jakku]], which ended the Galactic Civil War in the New Republic's favor.<ref name="Empire's End" />

===Battle of Jakku===
{{Quote|PREPARE TO FIRE ALL CANNONS. COMMENTARY: I SAY WE BLAST THE MEATBAG AND SAVE YOU THE TROUBLE, MASTER.''"<br>"''Bones, are you all right?''"<br>"''SORRY, MASTER TEMMIN'S MOM. GLITCH.|Mister Bones and Norra during the Battle of Jakku|Aftermath: Empire's End}}
Norra and Mister Bones' stolen Imperial shuttle soon found itself in a thick aerial battle over the skies of Jakku. Due to the damage he had sustained earlier, Mister Bones began to malfunction and made a remark about blasting meatbags, momentarily mistaking Norra for Temmin. After realizing his error, Bones apologized. Their shuttle was soon pursued by a [[T-65C-A2 X-wing starfighter]] piloted by Temmin. Temmin had convinced Wedge Antilles to re-establish [[Phantom Squadron (New Republic)|Phantom Squadron]] and enter the battle. Temmin disabled one of the shuttle's engines.<ref name="Empire's End" />

Recognizing that his master was flying the X-wing, Bones lowered the shuttle's ramp and waved to Temmin. Bones broadcast his voice into the com of Temmin's X-wing. Bones used his mechanical systems to improvise a com so that Temmin and his mother could talk. Norra told her son that she was heading to an Imperial base in the Sinking Fields. She also mentioned that she had Mister Bones with her and that the droid had saved her live. Norra also told Temmin not to follow her to the well-fortified Imperial base. Before returning to the dogfight, Temmin told Mister Bones to take care of his mother, something which Roger promised that he would do.<ref name="Empire's End" />

Norra managed to land the shuttle at the main Imperial base. She and Mister Bones then cornered Sloane and Brentin, who had just freed themselves of their restraints. Due to Brentin's unwilling role in the Attack on Chandrila, Norra was initially hostile towards her husband and told him to get his hands off her. Following Norra's cue, Bones grabbed his wrist and smashed Brentin against the wall, telling him that he had hurt Temmin. Norra then told Bones not to hurt Brentin, who reassured Norra that he was not with the Empire. Norra then told Sloane that she was taking the Grand Admiral back to Chandrila to face justice. However, Sloane instead convinced the Wexleys to help her take down Gallius Rax, the true mastermind behind the Liberation Day attack. She also told them that Rax had a secret facility in the Plaintive Hand plateau known as the Jakku Observatory. Norra made peace with both Sloane and Brentin, and the group headed towards the Jakku Observatory.<ref name="Empire's End" />

===Last stand===
{{Quote|HELLO, MASTER TEMMIN.''"<br>"''Bones. I missed you, buddy."<br>"I MISSED YOU. I PERFORMED VIOL&mdash;|Mister Bones' last conversation with Temmin before his permanent disintegration|Aftermath: Empire's End}}
[[File:Battle of Jakku chaos.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Mister Bones perished during the Battle of Jakku]]
While traveling on the stolen shuttle, Mister Bones and the others witnessed the [[Super Star Destroyer]] ''Ravager'' crashing onto Jakku's surface. The ''Ravager'' had once been Sloane's [[command ship]] until Rax had usurped her authority. The destruction of the ''Ravager'' turned the tide of the battle in the New Republic's favor. Bones' antennae soon detected the presence of Temmin nearby. Bones obtained Norra's permission to leave the ship and find Temmin, whose X-wing had been downed by space wreckage. He then entered into his wheel configuration and rolled down the ramp.<ref name="Empire's End" />

Mister Bones reached Temmin just in time to save the boy from being killed by three [[sandtrooper]]s and an [[All Terrain Scout Transport|AT-ST walker]]. Bones leapt down from the head of the AT-ST and killed two of the stormtroopers with his vibroblades. The third stormtrooper tried to shoot Bones but Temmin clubbed him in the head with a rifle. Bones then dodged the AT-ST's cannons and climbed the walker. He broke into the cockpit and proceeded to kill the [[AT-ST driver]]s. Bones then popped out of the walker wearing a pair of black-lens goggles. Before the two could engage in conversation, the AT-ST walker was destroyed by two passing [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor|A-wing fighters]].<ref name="Empire's End" />

Mister Bones was permanently disintegrated during the explosion. All that remained of him were his seared, melted limbs. Temmin wept on the battlefield for his lost best friend. However, Bones' loss was not in vain. Meanwhile, Norra, Brentin, and Sloane managed to stop Gallius Rax from detonating the planet Jakku as part of the Emperor's [[Contingency]] plan to destroy both the Empire and the New Republic fleet. Offworld, Chancellor Mon Mothma and [[Grand Vizier]] [[Mas Amedda]] signed the [[Galactic Concordance]], which ended the Galactic Civil War. Under the terms of the Concordance, the Empire capitulated and was formally dissolved. However, Imperial holdouts across the galaxy continued resisting the New Republic for months.<ref name="Empire's End" />

Following the Galactic Concordance, Temmin buried Mister Bones' droid arm with his father, Brentin, who had perished on Jakku at the hands of Gallius Rax. Per Akiva tradition, Brentin was buried in a salt mire so that his remains would be consumed by nature. During the funeral, a tearful Temmin told Bones to watch over his late father and to keep him safe.<ref name="Empire's End" /> Over the next [[34 ABY|twenty-nine years]], his former master Temmin would become a starfighter pilot in the [[New Republic Starfighter Corps]] before joining the [[Resistance]].<ref name="TFAVD">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref>

During the [[Cold war|conflict]] between the Resistance and the [[First Order]], whilst evading capture from the [[First Order Security Bureau]]'s [[Agent]] [[Terex]] and his [[Ranc gang]]. [[Poe Dameron]] was cornered in a cave on a [[Unidentified desert planet (Cold war)|desert planet]] along with droids [[C-3PO]] and [[N1-ZX]], while the rest of Dameron's fighter squad, [[Black Squadron (Resistance)|Black Squadron]], [[Battle over a desert planet|fought]] above the planet against Terex's ships. Unable to give aerial support to his squad leader, Temmin sent Dameron a droid personality template to fight the Rancs, explaining that he always carried the code with him for good luck. Once uploaded into N1-ZX, the [[BX-series droid commando|commando droid]] identified itself as "Mister Bones," and in a style reminiscing the original Mister Bones, slaughtered the gang while singing. Although his intervention served to save Dameron and buy him time, only a few moments after slaying the whole gang, the droid itself was decapitated by Agent Terex himself.<ref name="Poe Dameron 13" />

==Characteristics==
{{Quote|I AM GLAD YOUR EXISTENCE HAS NOT BEEN REDUCED TO SCATTERED ATOMS, MASTER TEMMIN'S MOM|Mister Bones, showing a sense of loyalty and concern for Master Temmin and his mother, Norra|Aftermath}}
Unlike other droids of his classification, Mister Bones was re-purposed with various combat droid programs, martial arts videos, the movement style of General [[Grievous]], and the body-mapped maneuvers of [[Ryloth]] [[la-ley dancer]]s. Because of his unique programming, he had developed a very strong sense of individual personality and an almost human-like bond with his master Temmin Wexley. While he was ruthless in combat, he was obedient and affectionate towards Temmin. He also came to respect and develop an affection for Temmin's mother, Norra; on one occasion, he expressed relief that she had not perished when her TIE fighter crashed.<ref name="Aftermath" />

After Temmin joined his mother's team, Mister Bones became the group's unofficial comedian and had a habit of singing and dancing for the fun of it. While Mister Bones was affectionate towards Temmin's friends and family, he was also capable of violence. On one occasion, he caught a butterfly and ripped off its wings for fun. Mister Bones was also perceptive enough to read Temmin's facial expressions and body language and could discern when he was upset.<ref name="Life Debt" />

Mister Bones was loyal and devoted to his master Temmin. Under Temmin's orders, Bones protected Norra during a dangerous mission to find Rae Sloane on Jakku. He was also programmed with ARM, allowing him to repair himself even after all his limbs had been dismembered. Despite his playful and sarcastic sense of humor, Bones could also be violent and once ripped the sadistic Imperial officer Effney to shreds for disintegrating him. Bones also had a child-like understanding of events and hurled Brentin against the wall since he had unwillingly hurt Temmin earlier on Chandrila. Bones' death was [[Mourning|mourned]] by Temmin, who had lost the droid he regarded as his best friend.<ref name="Empire's End" />

==Equipment==

[[File:Mister Bones with weapons.jpeg|thumb|right|250x250px|Mister Bones armed with a blaster and his blade.]]
Mister Bones was a highly modified [[B1 battle droid]]. Although maintaining the core structure of a B1, he was painted [[Color|black]] and red with the [[bone]]s of [[bird]]s, [[fish]], and other animals bound to his [[limb]]s and body. At least one of his limbs was equipped with a vibrating blade. Half of his head was removed and replaced with a telescoping red [[eye]], and the nose was sharpened to a fine point to resemble a bird of prey.<ref name="Aftermath" />

After being severely damaged while saving Temmin from a group of Imperial stormtroopers and gang members, Temmin was forced to replace one of Bones' arms with an astromech droid arm found in his aunt's house. Mister Bones quickly learned how to use the inferior limb as an effective bludgeoning tool when facing off against his foes.<ref name="Aftermath" />

Following the rebellion on Akiva, Mister Bones was rebuilt by Temmin and Norra. His frame now incorporated half a dozen extra joints which gave the droid a greater degree of contortion than the original B1 battle droids. At the advice of Jas Emari, Temmin also removed his decorative little bones to give the droid better stealth. Bones was also dexterous enough to capture a butterfly in his grasp. After losing an arm and bending his metal leg at Ashmead's Lock, Temmin managed to repair the droid using parts salvage from the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name="Life Debt" />

Bones was capable of rebooting himself. He was also programmed with an ARM system that allowed him to repair himself. By the Battle of Jakku, Bones had begun to malfunction due to the damage he had sustained in frequent skirmishes.<ref name="Empire's End" />

==Behind the scenes==
{{Quote|Well, Mr. Bones is a B-1 battle droid – so of course, B-dash-O-N-E, looks like Bone or Bones.|Chuck Wendig|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/09/04/star-wars-aftermath-force-awakens/3}}
Mister Bones was created by [[Chuck Wendig]] for his [[2015]] novel, ''[[Aftermath]]''. In an interview with ''Entertainment Weekly'', Wendig revealed that Mister Bones' name is derived from the phonetic spelling of his model, a B1 battle droid.<ref name="EW">http://www.ew.com/article/2015/09/04/star-wars-aftermath-force-awakens/3</ref> Bones appears as a supporting character in Wendig's ''[[Star Wars: The Aftermath Trilogy]]''.

In the third book of the trilogy, ''[[Aftermath: Empire's End]],'' Mister Bones has a line which was an apparent callback to [[HK-47]]'s blunt, violent dialogue. In the story of the novel; the droid suddenly "glitches," his voice "warps," then says "COMMENTARY: I SAY WE BLAST THE MEATBAG AND SAVE YOU THE TROUBLE, MASTER" with a "strange, hard-angle" accent. <ref>''[[Aftermath: Empire's End]]''</ref>
