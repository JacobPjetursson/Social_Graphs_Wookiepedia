{{Quote|I smell fear, and it smells good.|Trench|audio=ISmellFear-CaM.ogg|Cat and Mouse}}
'''Trench''' was a [[Harch]] [[Admiral]] and naval [[commander]] who survived a number of presumed [[death]]s throughout [[Sexes|his]] career. Hailing from [[Secundus Ando]], he acquitted himself in engagements with the [[Galactic Republic]], all the while savoring the terror he struck in his enemies. [[Standard year|Years]] after his purported death at the [[Battle of Malastare Narrows]], he resurfaced during the [[Clone Wars]], becoming a key [[officer]] in the [[Separatist navy|navy]] of the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. From the [[Providence-class dreadnought|dreadnought]] ''[[Invincible]]'' he oversaw the Confederate [[blockade]] of [[Christophsis]], which brought him into [[Battle of Christophsis|conflict]] with a Republic [[Fleet|battle group]] led by [[Jedi General]]s [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Anakin Skywalker]] along with an old foe, Admiral [[Wullf Yularen]]. When Skywalker and Yularen attempted to use an experimental [[stealth ship]] to breach the blockade, Trench began a deadly game of cat and mouse with them. Though Skywalker outwitted him by redirecting a volley of [[tracking torpedo]]es at the ''Invincible'', Trench managed to survive his [[flagship]]'s demise.

During the [[Battle of Ringo Vinda]], Trench captured [[clone trooper]] [[CT-5385|Tup]]&mdash;who had mysteriously gunned down [[Jedi]] [[General]] [[Tiplar]]&mdash;and tried to send the [[Cloning|clone]] to Separatist leader [[Count]] [[Dooku]] for examination, though a Republic team intervened and rescued Tup. In another [[Battle for Anaxes|campaign]], Trench besieged the [[Anaxes shipyards|Republic shipyards]] at [[Anaxes]] for [[Standard week|weeks]] on end, exploiting the [[Techno Union]]'s [[CT-1409|secret access]] to a Republic [[Rex's strategy algorithm|strategy algorithm]]. Even as the tide of battle began to turn, Trench remained intent on annihilating the Jedi and their clone infantry. Though he activated a bomb beneath the [[Anaxes assembly complex|assembly complex]] on Anaxes, Skywalker infiltrated Trench's [[Trench's flagship (Anaxes)|flagship]] and forced the admiral to divulge the sequence to disarm the device. When Trench tried to retaliate, Skywalker drove his [[Skywalker's lightsaber|lightsaber]] through his chest, inflicting a death that even the hardened Harch could not escape.

==Biography==
===Early life===
[[File:Trench symbol.svg|thumb|left|124x124px|Trench's personal symbol]]
Trench was a remarkably tough [[Sexes|male]] [[Harch]] [[Homeworld|from]] [[Secundus Ando]],<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" /> Trench saw service in multiple battles throughout his military career, mostly in [[cruiser]]-to-cruiser action. In many of these battles he would fight against forces utilizing [[cloak]]ed [[starship]]s, defeating them through the use of [[tracking torpedo]]es fixed on the vessels' magnetic signatures.<ref name="Cat and Mouse" />

Trench would eventually rise to command a corporate [[fleet]] that [[Battle of Malastare Narrows|blockaded]] the [[planet]] [[Malastare]]. Trench was able to hold his lines against a [[Galactic Republic|Republic]] fleet led by [[Wullf Yularen]] sent to break the [[blockade]], tearing their ships apart. However, a [[Jedi]]-led taskforce commanded by [[Jedi Master|Master]] [[Kep-She]] was able to defeat Trench, vaporizing his [[flagship]] and seemingly [[Death|killing]] him in the process. In reality, however, Trench survived the battle with the help of the Harch's hardy biology as well as a damaged pressure suit.<ref name="Cat and Mouse" /><ref name="Fact File 106">[[The Official Star Wars Fact File Part 106|''The Official Star Wars Fact File'' Part 106]]</ref>

===Clone Wars===
====Reemergence====
[[File:Trench armada.png|thumb|right|250px|"''I smell fear, and it smells good.''"]]
{{Quote|Turn back now. Retreat while you can, for I am your doom.|Trench|Cat and Mouse}}
Trench, along with his [[T-series tactical droid|tactical droid]], [[TI-99]], were then sent to [[Christophsis]]<ref name="Cat and Mouse" /> to assist [[General]] [[Whorm Loathsom|Loathsom]] and [[Count]] [[Dooku]]'s [[assassin]], [[Asajj Ventress]] in seizing the [[planet]] for the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Confederacy]], and [[Battle of Christophsis|blockading]] the planet to tighten their grip of the system.<ref name="The Hidden Enemy">{{TCW|The Hidden Enemy}}</ref> There, he commanded the blockade from his war-painted flagship, the ''[[Invincible]],'' to prevent [[Senator]] [[Bail Organa]] of [[Alderaan]] and other republic relief forces from being resupplied and to cripple any attempts to penetrate the blockade. Trench then held his lines against [[Jedi General]] [[Anakin Skywalker]]'s fleet. Trench then watched as the [[Grand Army of the Republic|Republic fleet]] retreated by the [[moon]] and had his force recharge their [[cannon]]s.<ref name="Cat and Mouse" />

While the Jedi retreated and regrouped, Trench felt that he had won the first round. His tactical droid was puzzled and asked Trench if they should pursue. The Admiral instead ordered his troops not to follow the enemy, as per the commands he was issued by higher authority; after which, Trench commanded his droids to recycle the ship's shields and allow the cannons to recharge to full power. The Admiral, satisfied with the proceedings, seated himself at the bridge and awaited for the return of the enemy ships.<ref name="Cat and Mouse" />

However, Trench's old adversary from Malastare Narrows, [[Admiral]] [[Wullf Yularen]], was also present with Skywalker at the battle. After recognizing Trench's trademark insignia painted on his flagship, Yularen studied everything [[Republic Intelligence]] had provided on the Admiral's tactics, allowing him to plan a counter-attack. This came in the form of an experimental stealth ship, piloted by Anakin Skywalker himself and Admiral Yularen as an adviser. Unaware of the existence and capabilities of the cloaked ship,Trench then grew impatient with the Republic fleet and to put pressure on the Republic fleet to attack, Trench sent a squadron of [[Hyena-class bomber|Hyena bombers]] to attack Organa's [[refugee]] camp, particularly the command center as a plan to draw out the Republic on the surface who Trench viewed as "cowards."<ref name="Cat and Mouse" />

When the Republic fleet did not attack, Trench undertsood that something odd was happening. Trench then spotted a [[Stealth ship|cloaked ship]] moving to attack him. Trench and his crew were then able to raise the ''Invincible's'' [[thermal shield]]s. Trench fired torpedoes at the stealth ship, but missed. Trench then ordered a volley of [[laser]]s to be fired at it, and since no shots landed, Trench was able to deduce that the [[pilot]] was a Jedi, not a [[Clone trooper|clone]].<ref name="Cat and Mouse" />

Trench sent a message to Skywalker, telling him that he has dealt with cloaked ships before. He also gloated that Christophsis' citizens and resources would join the Separatist Alliance. Trench also told Skywalker to retreat, for he was his doom. Trench prepared himself for the Jedi's inevitable second offensive. Eventually the cloaked vessel revealed itself, but this time, the crew had knowledge of Trench's tactics when dealing with ship cloaking devices. <ref name="Cat and Mouse" />

[[File:Trench 2.png|thumb|left|220x220px|Trench accepting his fate]]
After Skywalker attacked, Trench was able to track the ships magnetic signature using [[tracking torpedo]]es so he could follow and destroy them. At first, Trench's tactic worked. However, he would forced to lower his shields to do so and the droid advised that such a maneuver would be unwise. In a moment of compulsive anger (and against his droid's advice), Trench gave the order and the torpedoes were launched. He noticed that Skywalker was leading the torpedoes back to the ''Invincible's'' [[Bridge (starship)|bridge]]. Trench tried to raise his shields, to no avail. Trench accepted his fate,<ref name="Cat and Mouse" /> but was able to survive once again. However, he lost his left [[eye]] and several of his appendages.<ref name="The Unknown" />

====Cyborg====
[[File:Admiral-trench-count-dooku.png|thumb|right|270x270px|Trench speaks with Dooku]]
Trench, alongside the [[super tactical droid]] [[Kraken]], later commanded the [[Confederacy military|Separatist forces]] on the [[Ringo Vinda space station|space station]] at [[Ringo Vinda]] [[Battle of Ringo Vinda|against]] Jedi Generals [[Tiplee]], [[Tiplar]], Skywalker, and their [[Cloning|clone]] forces. As the Republic came close to breaking his lines, Trench witnessed one of the [[CT-5385|clone troopers]] kill General Tiplar. Trench's observation for minor details proved vital as it allowed Sidious and his apprentice, Count Dooku to create a cover-up before the Jedi Order could discover the existence of Protocol [[Order 66|66]] prematurely. Trench described to Count Dooku his observations, telling him that the clone looked "like he was in a trance of some kind." Trench then had Kraken capture and deliver the clone to Dooku, despite the Republic's [[blockade]]. After successfully kidnapping of the clone trooper "Tup," the Count applauded the Harch's success, Trench then tasked Kraken to personally escort the captured Clone to Dooku himself. However, the mission failed as the Republic recaptured Tup and Kraken was decapitated by Anakin Skywalker. Following the recapture of Tup, the Republic eventually withdrew its forces from Ringo Vinda.<ref name="The Unknown" />

====Death====
[[File:Trench_death.png|thumb|left|252x252px|Admiral Trench meets his demise after being interrogated by Anakin aboard his flagship.]]
Later in the [[Clone Wars]], Trench, now on the offensive, commanded the Confederate forces during the [[Battle for Anaxes|battle]]<ref name="The Bad Batch">{{TCW|The Bad Batch}}</ref> for the Republic's vital shipyards on [[Anaxes]] in a campaign which lasted for several weeks. Trench used his own tactical acumen, as well as using the Republic’s [[Rex's strategy algorithm|strategy algorithms]] against them using the [[Techno Union]]'s test subject on Skako Minor, a captured [[Advanced Recon Commando|ARC trooper]] named "[[CT-1409|Echo]]."<ref name="A Distant Echo">{{TCW|A Distant Echo}}</ref> Trench was killed by Skywalker after [[Clone Force 99]], [[Clone Captain|Captain]] [[Rex]], Anakin Skywalker, and Echo boarded his ship as Trench primed a bomb planted on the planet surface. Echo was able to decipher all but the final sequence for the bomb, forcing [[Anakin Skywalker]] to ambush Trench. The [[Jedi Knight]] destroyed Trench's [[Unidentified super tactical droid (Anaxes)|super tactical droid]] and [[BX-series droid commando]]s, and then threatened the admiral's life to get the final sequence for the detonation code. While Anakin was preoccupied giving [[Jedi General]] [[Mace Windu]] the final sequence, Trench took advantage of the Jedi's distraction by electrocuting him. This action prompted Anakin to retaliate, thrusting his [[lightsaber]] and delivering the final blow to the Harch Admiral. As Trench writhed in agony on the floor, Anakin acquired the self destruct detonator of the flagship and indifferently bid the admiral a final farewell as he departed. As Clone Force 99 escaped, they planted remote detonators along the corridors, and activated them after leaving the ship, vaporizing Trench's body along with several of his ships.<ref name="Unfinished Business" />

====Legacy====
Although Trench's flagship, the ''Invincible'', was destroyed by Anakin Skywalker in a cloaked stealth ship during the Battle of Christophsis, some of the flagship's modules were salvaged and used to modify a [[Berch Teller's warship|Separatist dreadnought]] owned by [[Berch Teller]]'s [[Berch Teller's rebel cell|rebel cell]] to [[Attack on Sentinel Base|attack]] the [[Galactic Empire|Empire's]] [[Sentinel Base]] in [[14 BBY]].<ref name="Tarkin">''[[Tarkin (novel)|Tarkin]]''</ref>

==Personality and traits==
[[File:Trench's file.png|thumb|right|242x242px|Trench's file brought up by Yularen including his signature crest seen emblazoned on his flagship.]]
Trench was a fearsome [[Harch]] admiral who was far larger than the average member of his species, as the arachnids seldom grew to such size due their [[skeleton|exoskeletons]] not being able to bear the weight of the [[hair|fur]].<ref name="Fact File 106" />

Trench became a terror on the battlefield, as he held no mercy or remorse toward his opponents. He was a well-decorated military genius and his aggressive tactics and maneuvers in combat made him responsible for the destruction of many Republic fleets.<ref name="Fact File 106" /> His skill in hunting cloaked ships through the use of tracking magnetic signatures was also noted and recorded in the [[Republic Intelligence]] record, which was studied during the blockade of Christophsis by Admiral [[Wullf Yularen|Yularen]].<ref name="Cat and Mouse" />

Trench prided himself for having won many victories in the war, resulting in him developing an overconfident personality and often boasting about outsmarting his opponents. Trench often viewed his battles like a game and would often cajole and taunt his enemies as he made his moves, before leading them into a vulnerable position where he could eliminate them. However, his overconfidence nearly led to his own demise at the hands of Anakin Skywalker when he made an uncharacteristic oversight which left himself vulnerable to incoming missiles. Even when his death appeared imminent, Trench did not panic or show distress; he simply accepted his fate.<ref name="Fact File 106" />

[[File:Trenchscreenshot3.png|thumb|left|244x244px|Trench brandishing an electronet.]]
Following his defeat, Trench was immediately fitted with "top-of-the-line" [[cybernetics]] making up half of his limbs and face to ensure his quick return to service. Trench, learning from his mistakes of lowering his guard, carried an electrostaff-cane variant as well as one of his cybernetic arms being equipped with an [[electronet]] which he used against Skywalker prior to his demise.<ref name="Fact File 106" />

==Trench's Flagships==
===Trench's First Ship===
Trench's first flagship was part of a [[Corporate fleet (Malastare)|corporate fleet]] which was present at the [[Battle of Malastare Narrows]] where Trench blockaded the planet and engaged [[Wullf Yularen|Wullf Yularen's]] republic fleet which was successful until a [[Jedi]]-led task force intervened and sabotaged his campaign. It was believed that he had gone down with his ship, but this was later proven false at the [[Battle of Christophsis]] in [[19 BBY]].<ref name="Cat and Mouse" />

===The'' Invincible''===
[[File:Invincible2-TCWs2BR3.png|thumb|right|175x175px]]
The ''[[Invincible]] ''served as the Harch commander's first command ship after his reemergence where it blockaded the planet of [[Christophsis]], offering a great range of attacks and it was said that the cruiser could blockade a planet on its own. Unlike the stock variant of a Separatist dreadnought; Trench's was well-equipped with heavy deflector and thermal shields which allowed for a powerful defense. However, Trench underestimated the opposing commander, Jedi Anakin Skywalker, resulting in him losing the upper hand and Anakin taking advantage of the Admiral's temper by redirecting Trench's projectiles to the [[bridge]] of his ship.<ref name="Cat and Mouse" />

===Trench's Flagship (Anaxes)===
[[Trench's flagship (Anaxes)|Trench's Flagship (Anaxes)]] was commanded by Trench during the [[Battle of Anaxes]] where he relayed transmissions from [[Wat Tambor]] on [[Skako Minor]] to predict the Republic's forces on Anaxes and issuing commands before being infiltrated by the Republic and ultimately assassinated by Anakin on the bridge of his ship.<ref name="The Bad Batch" />

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Trenchbadbatch.png|thumb|left|250px|Admiral Trench appears in the opening newsreel of the episode "The Bad Batch" in story reel format.]]
Admiral Trench was created for the ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' television series and made his first appearance in the second season of the series "[[Cat and Mouse]]" and voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]] also known for voicing the [[Clone trooper]]s in the series.<ref name="Cat and Mouse" />

Trench was confirmed to have survived in "Cat and Mouse" and make his return in the series in the [[The Clone Wars: The Lost Missions|sixth season]] episode "[[The Unknown]]", where Trench is alive with half his body consisting of cybernetics.<ref name="The Unknown" /> Additionally, ''Clone Wars'' writer [[Brent Friedman]] confirmed on his Twitter account that he wrote a four-part episode arc that wasn't published that featured Trench.<ref name="Friedman Twitter">{{Twitter|BFree63|status/353962107764609024|[[Brent Friedman]]|quote=One of the arcs I wrote, one you'll sadly never see, featured Trench. But really don't remember if the Order 66 arc does.}}</ref> The episode arc, was screened at [[Celebration Anaheim]] ''[[Star Wars]]'' convention as story reel form apart of ''[[The Clone Wars Legacy]]'' project in [[2015]], which would have featured the return and death of Admiral Trench. The episodes were later released on [[StarWars.com]].<ref name="Bad Batch Recon">{{SW|url=news/star-wars-the-clone-wars-bad-batch-recon|text=''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' 'Bad Batch' Recon}}</ref>
