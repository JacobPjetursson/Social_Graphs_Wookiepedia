{{Quote|I have no value to you. Kill me. My creature, Pateesa, is dead. All my beasts are gone&mdash;|Malakili, to Cobb Vanth|audio=Malakili_-_I_have_no_value_to_you.ogg|Aftermath: Life Debt}}
'''Malakili''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] from the [[planet]] [[Corellia]] who spent much of his [[Youngling|childhood]] living in the slums of the [[moon]] [[Nar Shaddaa]]. Having an affinity for [[Species|animals]], Malakili was hired as a [[beastmaster]] for [[Hutt]] [[circus]]es, but he was sold into [[slavery]] after a creature got loose and [[Death|killed]] audience members. Purchased by [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba the Hutt]], Malakili served as a caretaker to the creatures in [[Jabba's Palace]] on the [[desert]] planet [[Tatooine]]. During that [[time]], Malakili became fond of Jabba's [[rancor]], [[Pateesa]], and the creature saved his life during a [[Tusken Raider]] attack. Sympathizing with Pateesa, Malakili planned to one [[Standard day|day]] escape with the beast.

In [[4 ABY]], [[Luke Skywalker]] of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] arrived at Jabba's Palace in an attempt to [[Rescue of Han Solo|rescue]] [[Han Solo]]. Skywalker was tricked into Jabba's rancor pit, where, to Malakili's distress, the rebel killed Pateesa. In the aftermath, Skywalker escaped with Solo, and Jabba was killed. Over the following [[Standard month|months]], Malakili was one of the last to leave the palace, and he wandered into the [[Dune Sea]] toward the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]]. Feeling purposeless without his creatures, Malakili considered committing [[suicide]], and he wandered further into the desert.

In the desert, Malakili was attacked by the [[Red Key Raiders]], criminals who had risen to power in Jabba's absence, but he was rescued by [[Sheriff]] [[Cobb Vanth]] and [[Issa-Or]], self-proclaimed [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcers]]. When the two learned Malakili was a beastmaster, they offered him a job in [[Freetown]] to work with [[ronto]]s and [[Teacher|teach]] a [[Borgo|Huttlet]]. Malakili accepted the position and felt he had regained purpose. Vanth was concerned about the growing power of the Red Key Raiders, so with Malakili's help, the sheriff formed an alliance with a group of Tusken Raiders. Later, when Freetown was attacked by Red Key thugs, the Tusken Raiders arrived to help. Eventually, Malakili was reunited with [[Porcellus]], the former head [[chef]] of Jabba's Palace. Together, they traveled to [[Mos Eisley]] and opened the [[Crystal Moon Restaurant]].

==Biography==
===Beastmaster for the Hutts===

[[File:Malakili-Imperial-Assault.png|thumb|left|250px|From a young age, Malakili worked as a beastmaster for Hutt circuses.]]
Malakili was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] [[Reproduction|born]] on [[Corellia]],<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" /> a [[planet]] in [[the galaxy]]'s [[Core Worlds]].<ref name="Corellia">{{Databank|corellia|Corellia|archiveurl=http://archive.is/UcsV6}}</ref> Malakili departed Corellia at a [[Youngling|young]] age, winding up in the slums<ref name="Life Debt" /> of the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] [[moon]]<ref name="Star Wars 8">''[[Star Wars 8: Showdown on the Smuggler's Moon, Part I]]''</ref> [[Nar Shaddaa]]. Skilled with handling [[Species|beasts]], Malakili spent his childhood training vicious creatures called [[gugverm]]s to stop stealing from local [[Foodstuff|food]] stores; with [[time]], the gugverms became Malakili's pets, friends, and protectors.<ref name="Life Debt" /> Eventually, Malakili was hired as a [[beastmaster]] for traveling<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" /> [[Hutt]] [[circus]]es,<ref name="Life Debt" /> such as [[Circus Horrificus]],<ref name="Complete Locations" /> in which he domesticated and taught a variety of creatures, including [[sand dragon]]s, [[kill-wing]]s, costumed [[womp rat]]s, and eventually [[rancor]]s, monstrous creatures no one else could tame.<ref name="Life Debt" /> His circus career ended after a show on Nar Shaddaa, when one of the dangerous beasts got loose and [[Death|killed]] audience members.<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" />

As a result of the incident, Malakili was made a [[Slavery|slave]]<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" /> and, by [[0 BBY]],<ref name="Bounty Hunt date">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates the events of both ''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]'', which depicts the completion of the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star's]] [[superlaser]], and [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']], which depicts the [[Death Star]]'s destruction at the [[Battle of Yavin]], to [[0 BBY]]. Given that the Death Star's superlaser is fully operational in ''[[Bounty Hunt]]'', that story can therefore also be dated to 0 [[Galactic calendar|BBY]].</ref> was sold to [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]], a Hutt [[crime lord]] on the [[desert]] planet [[Tatooine]].<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" /> Serving as a caretaker in [[Jabba's Palace]], Malakili was responsible for tending to Jabba's [[Zoo|menagerie]] of creatures, including the Hutt's prized<ref name="Databank">{{Databank|malakili|Malakili|archiveurl=http://archive.is/c8Cpj}}</ref> male rancor,<ref name="AEYNTK">''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know]]''</ref> [[Pateesa]],<ref name="Life Debt" /> who was named after the [[Huttese]] word for "friend."<ref name="AEYNTK" /> Pateesa was purposed with [[Diet|eating]] [[prisoner]]s, and Malakili would tend to the wounds he received doing so. During Malakili's time at Jabba's Palace, he became very fond of the rancor, and he, along with the [[Kadas'sa'Nikto]] [[Giran]], considered Pateesa to be their favorite of Jabba's creatures. Pateesa also had a fondness for Malakili, and one [[Standard day|day]], when the beastmaster was attacked by [[Tusken Raider]]s, the rancor saved his life.<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" /> In Jabba's Palace, Malakili grew sympathetic toward Pateesa, and he planned to one [[Standard day|day]] escape with the creature.<ref name="Head-to-Head" />

Shortly before the [[Battle of Endor]] in [[4 ABY]],<ref name="Galactic Atlas">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]''</ref> [[Jedi]] [[Luke Skywalker]], a [[commander]] in the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]], attempted a [[Rescue of Han Solo|bargain]] with Jabba to save the life of his captured friend, [[Han Solo]]. Jabba declined the offer and tricked the Jedi,<ref name="Episode VI" /> who, along with the [[Gamorrean]] guard [[Jubnuk]],<ref name="Complete Locations" /> fell through a trap door leading to the palace's rancor pit. While the guard was promptly eaten by Pateesa, Skywalker evaded the beast's claws and ran under the pit's gate toward a [[Viewport|windowed]] back door. When Skywalker reached the exit, he discovered it was locked from the other side and would not open for him.<ref name="Episode VI" /> Malakili and Giran were in the adjoining chamber, playfully fighting over their dinner, and when Skywalker tried opening the barred gate, the two laughed at the rebel and used [[spear]]s to force him away.<ref name="Return of the Jedi">[[Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (paperback novel)|''Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'' junior novelization]]</ref>

[[File:Malakili_weeping.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Malakili and Giran weep at Pateesa's demise.]]
As the rancor approached Skywalker, the cornered Jedi picked up a [[Skeleton|skull]], and he used [[the Force]] to propel it toward the gate's utility panel. The [[bone]] smashed the button, causing the panel to short-circuit and release the gate down upon the rancor's head, crushing the beast's skull.<ref name="Beware">''[[Return of the Jedi: Beware the Power of the Dark Side!]]''</ref> Shocked,<ref name="Databank" /> Malakili opened the door, rushed to Pateesa's side, and wept upon seeing he was dead. Whimpering, Malakili turned away from the fallen beast, placing an [[Limb|arm]] around Giran for comfort.<ref name="Episode VI" />

===Leaving the palace===
Following the rancor's death, Jabba demanded that Skywalker and his friends be taken to the [[Dune Sea]] and executed in the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]], the resting place of a [[sarlacc]], a dangerous creature and one of Jabba's favorite pets. While Jabba left aboard his [[sail barge]], the ''[[Khetanna]]'', to witness the execution,<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars">''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''</ref> Malakili remained in the palace with several others. However, the rebels escaped, killed Jabba, and destroyed the sail barge, leaving the palace residents unsure of what to do. The inhabitants of Jabba's Palace said that a new Hutt would come to take the castle, so Malakili remained, waiting for his new employer to arrive.<ref name="Life Debt" />

After a time, the palace began to run out of food and [[water]], but Malakili and many other residents still stayed. Some of the palace dwellers realized that no Hutt was coming, creating rumors that changes in the [[galaxy]] had caused fighting to erupt among the Hutts in an underworld war. As many of the tenants left, Malakili became one of the last to remain in the otherwise empty fortress, but one day he also left, putting the palace<ref name="Life Debt" /> and the unmoved carcass of Pateesa<ref name="Battlefront">''[[Star Wars Battlefront]]''&mdash;''Outer Rim''</ref> behind him.<ref name="Life Debt" />

[[File:Dune_Sea.png|thumb|left|300px|Without his creatures, Malakili felt purposeless and wandered the Dune Sea.]]
Feeling purposeless without Pateesa and his other creatures, Malakili set out toward the Great Pit of Carkoon, creating an ultimatum for himself: successfully tame the sarlacc, or commit [[suicide]] by throwing himself into the monster's [[mouth]]. When Malakili reached the sarlacc, he found it was injured; the ''Khetanna''{{'}}s destruction had sent [[Fire|burning]] wreckage onto the creature, partially exposing its massive body from the sand, and [[Jawa]]s had slit open its [[Stomach|stoma-tubes]] to [[Scavenger|scavenge]] weapons, [[armor]], [[droid]]s, and tools. Upon seeing the sarlacc wailing, unable to fend off pillagers and deprived of its sole purpose, Malakili empathized with the creature and wept.<ref name="Life Debt" />

===Finding purpose===
{{Quote|We got a couple [of] unruly rontos that could use a steady hand. Can you handle that? There'd be payment. And a homestead for you if you care to claim it.''"<br />"''I&hellip;can.|Cobb Vanth and Malakili|audio=Vanth_-_unruly_rontos.ogg|Aftermath: Life Debt}}
In [[5 ABY]],<ref name="LifeDebtdate">{{LifeDebtdate}}</ref> [[Standard month|months]] after Jabba's death, Malakili wandered toward the [[City|town]] of [[Freetown|Mos Pelgo]]. En route, he was found by two thugs of the [[Red Key Raiders]], a criminal syndicate that posed as a [[mining]] company. Malakili ran from the gang, but he was older and slower than he once had been, and the thugs quickly caught up, knocking him to the ground and rummaging through his few belongings. One of the thugs took Malakili's [[waterskin]], drank what was left, and introduced himself as [[Bivvam Gorge]]. Gorge declared that the area was the territory of the Red Key, and that the leader of the syndicate, [[Lorgan Movellan]], deserved his cut of Malakili's possessions. A [[blaster]] bolt then struck and killed Gorge, and the [[Unidentified Red Key Raider|remaining thug]] began firing at the attackers before being shot himself. Malakili feared the gunmen were also raiders, so he played dead.<ref name="Life Debt" />

The new arrivals, a human man and a [[Twi'lek]] woman, approached Malakili, introducing themselves as [[Cobb Vanth]] and [[Issa-Or]]. Vanth explained that he was a [[Law enforcement agency|lawman]] and de facto [[mayor]] of Mos Pelgo, which had been renamed Freetown. When the pair asked Malakili if he had any skills, he stated that he was worthless without his creatures. Issa-Or asked Malakili if he was a beastmaster, and he replied that he was. Hearing this, Vanth offered Malakili a job taming [[ronto]]s, which the trainer accepted. Asked if he could train a Huttlet, the beastmaster replied that he could [[Teacher|teach]] one and agreed to work with Vanth in Freetown.<ref name="Life Debt" /> Feeling a new sense of purpose, Malakili taught the Huttlet, whom he named [[Borgo]], in Freetown. Vanth, acting as Freetown's [[sheriff]], was wary of the Red Key's growing power, so he made a deal with a group of Tusken Raiders, who agreed to leave Freetown alone in exchange for water. To complete the deal, Malakili procured a [[krayt dragon pearl]], gifting it to the Tusken Raiders in exchange for their protection.<ref name="Empire's End">''[[Aftermath: Empire's End]]''</ref>

[[File:Mos_Eisley.png|thumb|right|300px|Malakili eventually traveled to Mos Eisley, where he opened a restaurant with Porcellus.]]
Months into Malakili's stay, the alliance was put to use when an [[army]] of Red Key Raiders, led by Movellan, [[Skirmish in Freetown|attacked]] Freetown. During the raid, Malakili was chained up by Movellan's thugs, and he, along with Vanth and Borgo, was dragged into the town's center. As Movellan prepared to kill them, Vanth signaled Malakili with a nod and a wink, and the beastmaster returned the nod, instructing Borgo to alert the Tuskens. However, [[Trayness]], a Red Key thug, clubbed Malakili in the head, causing the man to clutch the [[Blood|bleeding]] wound and fall. Responding to Malakili's order, the Huttlet released a howl, and soon after, the town's front gates opened as a Tusken astride a massive [[bantha]] charged toward the Red Key thugs. As more Tuskens arrived, Malakili used a [[magna-driver]] to remove his and Vanth's shackles, and the lawman attacked Movellan, stating that Freetown would never submit.<ref name="Empire's End" />

Sometime after the skirmish, Malakili was reunited with [[Porcellus]], the former head [[chef]] of Jabba's Palace. The two became business partners, and they eventually traveled to [[Mos Eisley]], where they opened the [[Crystal Moon Restaurant]].<ref name="Complete Locations" />

''Teach'' one, then.''"<br />"''I could. I believe.|Cobb Vanth and Malakili|audio=Vanth_-_Hutts.ogg|Aftermath: Life Debt}}
Malakili was a [[Corellian]]<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" /> with [[Color|blue]] [[eye]]s and light skin.<ref name="Episode VI" /> Having a giant<ref name="Beware" /> and burly stature,<ref name="Databank" /> he stood at a height of 1.72 [[meter]]s, or five [[Foot|feet]], eight [[inch]]es,<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" /> and had a mass of 95 [[kilogram]]s.<ref name="Head-to-Head" /> Although the Corellian was naive,<ref name="Life Debt" /> brutish,<ref name="Beware" /> tough, crude,<ref name="Galactic Defense">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Defense]]'' {{C|[[:File:Galactic Defense shutdown.png|shutdown date]]}}</ref> and antisocial, he displayed tenderness and sympathy toward animals,<ref name="Head-to-Head" /> caring deeply for all of his creatures.<ref name="Galactic Defense" /> Malakili cared most of all for the rancors, whom he thought to be precious, and he took joy in working with them.<ref name="Life Debt" /> When Pateesa, the human's favorite creature,<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" /> was killed, he wept with shock.<ref name="Databank" /> After the deaths of Pateesa and Jabba, Malakili thought that Luke Skywalker was a lucky fool and that the Jedi's rebel friends were cruel.<ref name="Life Debt" />

[[File:RIP_Pateesa.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Following the death of Jabba, Malakili was one of the last to leave the palace and Pateesa behind.]]
Having abandoned Jabba's Palace, Malakili contemplated feeding himself to Jabba's sarlacc as a means of committing suicide. Upon finding the creature severely wounded, the beastmaster sympathized with the monster, as its only purpose had been taken from it, and he wept for its fate. Malakili believed that his sole purpose in life was working with animals, and he felt useless without his creatures. As he wandered the deserts of Tatooine, the beastmaster felt like a scrap of cloth or piece of trash being blown across the sand without destination or meaning, and he believed he was going to die. After Cobb Vanth rescued Malakili from Red Key Raiders, the sheriff told him that he looked familiar, but the Corellian responded that he was no one. Malakili added that he had no value or use to Vanth, and he told the man to kill him.<ref name="Life Debt" />

When Issa-Or inquired if Malakili was a beastmaster, the human thought he was undeserving of the word "master," but he acknowledged that he trained beasts. Once Vanth offered Malakili a job in Freetown, the beastmaster felt that he had found a new purpose, and he felt the darkness inside of his [[heart]] be replaced with light.<ref name="Life Debt" /> Malakili stayed in Freetown for months, and during the raid on Freetown, he felt gleeful, despite receiving injuries.<ref name="Empire's End" />

Despite being a slave to Jabba,<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" /> Malakili saw the Hutt as an employer who provided him with food, a home, and a purpose. When Vanth and Issa-Or introduced themselves as law enforcers, the former slave did not believe them, nor did he believe there could be any law on Tatooine without the Hutts. Malakili considered the Hutts [[Sentience|sentient]] beings, not pets, and he thus corrected Vanth after being asked if he could train a Huttlet, remarking he could instead teach one. Once Vanth reworded the proposition, the beastmaster accepted.<ref name="Life Debt" /> Later, Malakili named the Huttlet Borgo, and during the raid on Freetown, the beastmaster comforted Borgo using a singsong voice.<ref name="Empire's End" />

==Skills and abilities==
{{Quote|You a beastmaster?''"<br />"''I train beasts. Yes.|Issa-Or and Malakili|audio=Issa-Or_-_beastmaster.ogg|Aftermath: Life Debt}}
[[File:Rancor-CHRON.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Malakili was capable of training rancors.]]
Skilled with animals from a young age, Malakili trained vicious gugverms on Nar Shaddaa to stop stealing from food stores, and with time the creatures became his pets, friends, and protectors. The human was hired as a beastmaster for Hutt circuses, and he trained a variety of creatures, including sand dragons, kill-wings, womp [[rat]]s, and rancors, the latter of which no one else could tame. During his slavery to Jabba, Malakili worked with the Hutt's creatures, including the rancor Pateesa. The slave befriended the rancor and tended wounds he received, and Pateesa saved Malakili's life during a Tusken Raider attack.<ref name="Life Debt" />

While wandering the Tatooine desert, Malakili was rescued from Red Key Raiders by Vanth and Issa-Or, and the Corellian played dead, a trick he had learned from many of his creatures.<ref name="Life Debt" /> The human was able to gather a [[krayt dragon]] pearl, which he gifted to Tusken Raiders in exchange for their protection.<ref name="Empire's End" />

==Equipment==
{{Quote|What else you got, wanderer?|Bivvam Gorge, to Malakili|audio=Gorge_-_what_else.ogg|Aftermath: Life Debt}}
As a rancor keeper, Malakili wielded a [[gaderffii stick]],<ref name="Databank" /> and he used cages for transporting young rancors.<ref name="Galactic Defense" /> Additionally, Malakili's [[sleep]]ing quarters in the palace were connected to the rancor pit, and the room was equipped with a device capable of [[stun]]ning the beast into submission.<ref name="Complete Locations" /> At the time of Skywalker's arrival, Malakili wore a dark, sweat-soaked rag [[belt]], ancient circus [[Clothing|pants]], a brown headdress, spiked [[Bracelet|armbands]], and wrist guards.<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" />

While wandering in the desert, Malakili wore a hood and carried a satchel that contained a waterskin, a lucky braid of bantha [[Hair|fur]] and [[Tooth|teeth]], a small water shiv made out of [[dewback]] bone, and a few droid gears and shiny [[Currency|chits]] to pay off Jawas or Tusken Raiders.<ref name="Life Debt" /> During the skirmish in Freetown, Malakili used a magna-driver to remove Vanth's shackles.<ref name="Empire's End" />

==Behind the scenes==
{{Quote|I like the idea that everyone loves someone. And even the worst, most horrible monster you can imagine was loved by his keeper. And the rancor probably loved his keeper.|George Lucas|The Making of Return of the Jedi}}
[[File:Paul_Brooke_as_Malakili.png|thumb|left|200px|Paul Brooke on the set of ''Return of the Jedi'']]
Malakili first appeared in [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']], the final film in the [[original trilogy]], which was released on [[May 25]], [[1983]]. Malakili was conceived by [[George Lucas]], who liked the idea of someone loving the rancor. The character was first imagined as an [[alien]], but he was changed to a human. In [[December]] [[1981]], Malakili's costume concept was finalized by [[Nilo Rodis-Jamero]]. Malakili was portrayed by [[Paul Brooke]], and his sobs were provided by [[Ernie Fosselius]];<ref name="Making">''[[The Making of Return of the Jedi]]''</ref> neither Brooke nor Fosselius were credited in the film.<ref name="Episode VI" /> Many film critics praised Malakili's brief appearance, and [[Wikipedia:Roger_Ebert|Roger Ebert]] of the [[Wikipedia:Chicago_Sun-Times|''Chicago Sun-Times'']] noted that details like Malakili's distress are what make ''[[Star Wars]]'' films "more than just [[Wikipedia:Space_opera|space operas]]."<ref name="Making" />

In ''Return of the Jedi'', Malakili was unnamed, listed in production notes as the "human rancor keeper,"<ref name="Making" /> but he was later named in the ''[[Star Wars Roleplaying Game]]'' of the [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] continuity.<ref name="Mysteries">{{SW|url=news/star-wars-mysteries-who-is-wiebba-wiebba|text=''Star Wars'' Mysteries: Who is Weibba-Wiebba?|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119034057/http://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-mysteries-who-is-wiebba-wiebba}}</ref> In the new ''Star Wars'' [[canon]], the name "Malakili" was first used in the [[Video game|mobile game]] ''[[Star Wars: Force Collection]]'', which initially launched in [[2013]].<ref name="Force Collection">{{ForceCollection|Malakili|star=1}}</ref> Although the launch of ''Force Collection'' predates<ref name="Force Collection release">{{SW|url=news/announcing-star-wars-force-collection.html|text=Announcing Star Wars: Force Collection|archivedate=20141008122906}}</ref> the ''Star Wars'' canon reset of [[2014]],<ref name="Legends">{{SW|url=news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page.html|text=The Legendary Star Wars Expanded Universe Turns a New Page|archivedate=20170921050922}}</ref> [[Lucasfilm Story Group]] member [[Leland Chee]] confirmed that the game was kept updated to fit with canon.<ref name="Twitter">{{Twitter|holocronkeeper|status/846807700482666496|[[Leland Chee]]|quote=I'm not gonna go through the trouble of changing them and I don't have any reason to believe currently that anyone would.

Beyond ''Return of the Jedi'', Malakili appeared in ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Defense]]'',<ref name="Galactic Defense" /> a [[Wikipedia:Tower defense|tower defense]] mobile game released in 2014<ref name="Galactic Defense release">{{SW|url=news/star-wars-galactic-defense-arrives-on-mobile-devices|text=''Star Wars: Galactic Defense'' Arrives on Mobile Devices|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119035250/http://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-galactic-defense-arrives-on-mobile-devices}}</ref> and discontinued in [[2016]]. In ''Galactic Defense'', Malakili, alongside Luke Skywalker, were unlockable Champions available during the limited-time event "Enter the Pit." Players who won Malakili were able to use him on missions, and they could use his Champion Skill of summoning a young rancor to help fight enemy forces.<ref name="Galactic Defense" /> According to ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: Head-to-Head]]'', a young-readers reference book by [[Pablo Hidalgo]], Malakili would likely lose in a theoretical fight against [[Bobbajo]],<ref name="Head-to-Head" /> a storytelling [[Nu-Cosian]] who trained various critters.<ref name="All Creatures Great and Small">{{Shortstory|story=All Creatures Great and Small|book=Tales from a Galaxy Far, Far Away: Aliens: Volume I}}</ref> In [[2015]], [[Chuck Wendig]], author of the novel ''[[Aftermath]]'', expressed interest in potentially writing stories about [[Omi]], [[Chief]] [[Chirpa]], or Malakili.<ref name="Chuck Wendig's War">{{InsiderCite|160|Chuck Wendig's War}}</ref> Subsequently, Wendig featured Malakili in the remainder of ''[[Star Wars: The Aftermath Trilogy|The Aftermath Trilogy]]'', with the character appearing in interlude chapters of ''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]'' and ''[[Aftermath: Empire's End]]''.<ref name="Life Debt" /><ref name="Empire's End" />
