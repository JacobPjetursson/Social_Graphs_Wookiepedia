{{Quote|I guess your purge wasn't efficient enough, Vader!|Echuu Shen-Jon to Darth Vader|Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds}}
'''Echuu Shen-Jon''' was a [[Sexes/Legends|male]] [[Human/Legends|human]] [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] in the waning years of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] until its fall, and served as a [[Jedi General/Legends|Jedi General]] in the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. During the war, he went into hiding and eventually re-emerged to fight for the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel Alliance]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
A [[Force-sensitive/Legends|Force-sensitive]] [[Human/Legends|Human]], Echuu Shen-Jon was [[Jedi training/Legends|educated]] in the ways of [[The Force/Legends|the Force]] by the [[Jedi Order/Legends|Jedi Order]] at the [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] [[Jedi Temple]]. Upon [[Jedi Initiate Trials|graduating]] from the [[Jedi academy|Temple academy]], Shen-Jon was selected as a [[Padawan/Legends|Padawan]] by [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Mace Windu/Legends|Mace Windu]]. Successfully constructing a green-bladed [[Lightsaber/Legends|lightsaber]] and passing his [[Jedi Trials/Legends|Trials of Knighthood]], Padawan Shen Jon ascended to the rank of Jedi Knight.<ref name="Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds: Clone Campaigns" />

===Clone Wars===
{{Quote|Echuu was accomplishing every task that the Jedi Council asked of him. He was becoming a General that the Confederacy feared. As he grew in power, I knew the dark side would also be growing in its temptation.|[[Mace Windu/Legends|Mace Windu]].|Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds: Clone Campaigns}}
[[File:Stam Death.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Echuu Shen-Jon looking upon the body of his Padawan, Stam Reath.]]
Later, as a Jedi Master, Shen-Jon took a Padawan of his own, [[Stam Reath]], during the time that the [[Separatist Crisis/Legends|Separatist Crisis]] plagued the [[Galactic Senate/Legends|Galactic Senate]]. The master and apprentice team joined Master Windu's [[Geonosis strike team|task force]] formed to [[First Battle of Geonosis|rescue]] Jedi [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Anakin Skywalker]], and [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Padmé Amidala/Legends|Padmé Amidala]] from [[Geonosis/Legends|Geonosis]]. Landing on the planet with over two hundred Jedi, Master Shen-Jon and Padawan Reath did not enter the [[Petranaki arena/Legends|Petranaki arena]] with the others; instead they were were assigned the task of destroying several [[Trade Federation/Legends|Trade Federation]] [[Core ship/Legends|core ships]]. They succeeded, and were then ordered to pursue Separatist leader [[Count of Serenno/Legends|Count]] [[Dooku/Legends|Dooku]] as he attempted to reach his escape craft. Along the way they were intercepted by the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems/Legends|Confederacy of Independent Systems]] [[General/Legends|General]] [[Sev'rance Tann]], who quickly slew Padawan Reath before Master Shen-Jon's eyes.<ref name="Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds: Clone Campaigns" />

Escaping the battle, Master Shen-Jon slipped into depression. When General Tann reappeared from the shadows, [[First Battle of Sarapin|taking]] the planet [[Sarapin/Legends|Sarapin]] in a shocking move with the help of stolen [[Decimator (war machine)|Decimator]] technology, the [[Jedi High Council/Legends|Jedi High Council]] hurriedly assigned Shen-Jon a new Padawan&mdash;[[Naat Reath]], Stam Reath's sister.<ref name="Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds: Clone Campaigns" />

Together, Shen-Jon and Reath led a series of successful campaigns against Tann and quickly [[Second Battle of Sarapin|took back]] Sarapin. As the weight of war grew heavier, Master Shen-Jon and his new apprentice sank deeper into the lull of the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side of the Force]], each wanting revenge for the death of Stam Reath. Shen-Jon tracked Tann across [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] to the planet [[Krant]], but along the way, Reath was captured by the [[Chiss/Legends|Chiss]] general. Master Shen-Jon did not heed the warnings of Master Windu as he slipped into the dark side and went after Tann.<ref name="Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds: Clone Campaigns" />

[[File:Echuu Dark side.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Shen-Jon tempted by the [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]].]]

After weeks of pursuit, Master Shen-Jon confronted Tann alone in the heart of a Confederate fortress on Krant. Besting her after calling upon the dark side of the Force, Shen-Jon carried out his revenge for his fallen Padawan and slew Tann. Contacting his current Padawan, Shen-Jon admitted he could not return to the Order until he had meditated on his crimes against the [[Jedi Code/Legends|Jedi Code]]. He told Reath that she would make a fine [[Jedi Knight/Legends|Jedi Knight]] one day, and bade her return to the Temple for reassignment. This she did, but she never revealed Shen-Jon's location.<ref name="Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds: Clone Campaigns" />

===Exile and re-emergence===
Master Shen-Jon survived in hiding for over two decades through the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire's]] [[Great Jedi Purge]] and the disbanding of the Order. His exile would be the very thing which spared his life from the likes of the Empire's forces. During this time period, he had lost his old green lightsaber, but acquired a new blue one, which he from then on used as his weapon of choice. In [[0 ABY/Legends|0.5 ABY]], some time after the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|destruction]] of the first [[Death Star/Legends|Death Star]], Shen-Jon finally reemerged for his exile when Princess [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]] had crash-landed on the world of [[Krant]]. There he aided her in her struggle against the Empire, defending the cities of Krant with his lightsaber.<ref name="Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds" />

Later, when Organa met with [[Utric Sandov]], Shen-Jon was surprised to hear that the Imperials had found the ancient [[Jedi artifact]] [[Vor'Na'Tu]]. He accompanied her to [[Hanoon|Geddes]] and together they obtained the artifact, but upon returning to their shuttle they found [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] awaiting their arrival.<ref name="Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds" /> Vader demanded that they hand over the relic to him, but Shen-Jon refused to surrender and destroyed it instead. Engaging the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord]] in a [[Lightsaber duel/Legends|duel]], Shen-Jon's skills were no match for the [[Sith Lord/Legends|Sith Lord's]] and eventually Echuu Shen-Jon was killed. In dueling Vader, he gave Princess Organa enough time to escape.<ref name="The New Essential Chronology">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref>

===Legacy===
Even after his death, Echuu Shen Jon managed to transcend the physical plane and live on as a force spirit. Years later after his death and the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|defeat of the Empire]] at [[Endor/Legends|Endor]], Master Echuu Shen-Jon's [[Force ghost|spirit]] warned the Princess and [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] about the Vor'Na'Tu and urged them to return to Geddes, since [[Terraforming|terraformed]] and renamed [[Hanoon]], to secure the relic once and for all. Organa and Skywalker [[Battle of Hanoon|liberated]] the world and destroyed the Vor'Na'Tu's shards. Shen-Jon was never known to contact them again.<ref name="Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds" />

==Behind the scenes==
Echuu Shen-Jon was first mentioned in the [[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds: Prima's Official Strategy Guide|strategy guide]] for the [[2001]] [[video game]] ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds]].'' He appeared in the game's Rebel campaign where he was voiced by [[Roger Jackson]]. His backstory was revealed in the expansion pack ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds: Clone Campaigns|Clone Campaigns]]''.

During the Clone Wars, Echuu Shen-Jon had a green lightsaber. However, by the time of Leia Organa's visit, it had changed to blue. This may have been due to the fact that the model used to represent Shen-Jon was recycled from that of the game's Jedi Master class, which carries a blue lightsaber.
