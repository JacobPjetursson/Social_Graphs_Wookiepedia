{{Quote|Sir, you seem troubled.''"<br />"''Well, Quinlan Vos has that effect.|Commander Cody and Obi-Wan Kenobi|Hunt for Ziro}}
Hailing from the [[planet]] [[Kiffu]], '''Quinlan Vos''' was a [[Sexes|male]] [[Kiffar]] [[Jedi Master]] who lived during the final days of the [[Galactic Republic]]. He was a maverick within the [[Jedi Order]] and garnered a reputation for bending the rules. He was renowned for his retrocognition—perceiving others' memories when touching objects they had contacted. Due to this ability, Vos was an expert tracker. Many of his missions took him into the criminal underworld. On one such mission he met [[Aayla Secura]] and thereafter accepted her as his [[Padawan]].

During the [[Clone Wars]], a [[Hutt]] [[crime lord]] named [[Ziro Desilijic Tiure|Ziro]] escaped imprisonment in the Galactic Republic [[capital]], [[Coruscant]]. Vos teamed with Jedi Master [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] to track and recapture him. Finding that Ziro had been freed by [[bounty hunter]] [[Cad Bane]], Vos and Kenobi followed their trail to [[Nal Hutta]], the Hutt [[homeworld]], and then eventually to [[Teth]]. Here they discovered Ziro had been murdered and subsequently [[Showdown on Teth|failed their attempt at arresting Bane]].

Later in the war, Vos partnered with [[Asajj Ventress]], a former [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]] [[assassin]]. The duo was unsuccessful in their attempt to assassinate [[Sith Lord]] [[Dooku|Count Dooku]], brutal leader of the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. In an attempt to uncover the identity of Dooku's master, [[Darth Sidious]], Vos succumbed to the dark side. However, he was [[Light side of the Force|brought back]] by his love for Ventress.

During the final days of the war, Vos moved his [[Grand Army of the Republic|Republic]] troops to [[Boz Pity]]. After the [[Order 66|fall]] of the Jedi Order, Vos was amongst those the [[Galactic Empire]] presumed to have survived the [[Jedi Purge]].

==Biography==
===Early life and Jedi service===
{{Quote|It's forbidden for Jedi to form attachments, yet we are supposed to be compassionate.''"''<br />''"''It is nothing to be ashamed of, Ahsoka. I went through the same process when I was your age with my own master.''"''<br />''"''Really? You?''"''<br />''"''He was like a father to me. I realized that for the greater good, I had to let him go.|[[Ahsoka Tano]] and Aayla Secura, after Tano's master, Anakin Skywalker, was gravely wounded in battle|Jedi Crash}}
[[File:VosAndRags.png|thumb|250px|left|Vos, seated on the left, during his mission in Mos Espa&mdash;as Anakin Skywalker passes by.]]
Quinlan Vos was born on the [[planet]] [[Kiffu]] in the [[Standard year|years]] prior to the fall of the [[Galactic Republic]]. [[Sexes|He]] became a member of the [[Jedi Order]], becoming [[Padawan|apprentice]] to [[Jedi Master]] [[Tholme]]. Although he was not born in the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]], he considered it home for it was where he grew up. He ended and started fights in rooms meant for fighting and in some that were not. He also took sneak naps in the Temple's library.<ref name="Dark Disciple" /> Vos eventually rose to the rank of [[Jedi Knight]]. Vos gained a reputation as a maverick who did not always follow the rules of [[Jedi]] life. He became renowned, however, for his [[Psychometry|ability]] to see the memories of other beings simply by touching an object that such beings had come into contact with. This allowed him to develop skills as an expert tracker, and, as a result, often took missions that dealt with the criminal underworld.<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" />

It was on one such mission that Vos met [[Aayla Secura]], a [[Twi'lek]] who displayed a [[Force-sensitive|sensitivity]] to the [[Force power|powers]] of [[the Force]]. During the mission, Vos rescued Secura from a dangerous area on her [[homeworld]] of [[Ryloth]].<ref name="Quinlan Vos SWE">{{SWE|characters|quinlanvos|Quinlan Vos}}</ref> The maverick Jedi took Secura as his Padawan,<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" /> and the two formed a close relationship.<ref name="Jedi Crash">{{TCW|Jedi Crash}}</ref> Secura later became a Jedi Knight.<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" />

In [[32 BBY]],<ref name="Galactic Atlas">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]''</ref> Vos was on a mission in [[Mos Espa]], a [[spaceport]] settlement on the [[desert]] world of [[Tatooine]]. Coincidentally, Jedi Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and his Padawan, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], were also on Tatooine; the two Jedi had chosen to land their [[Naboo Royal Starship|vessel]], carrying [[Monarch of Naboo|Queen]] [[Padmé Amidala]] of [[Naboo]], on Tatooine after it sustained damage while it escaped from the [[Trade Federation]]'s [[Invasion of Naboo|blockade]] of Naboo. Vos was present to witness one of the earliest meetings between Jinn and [[Anakin Skywalker]], a young Mos Espa [[Slavery|slave]] who Jinn would soon come to believe was the [[Chosen One]] destined to bring balance to the Force.<ref name="Episode I">[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']]</ref><ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" />

===The Clone Wars===
====The hunt for Ziro====
{{Quote|I never did enjoy hanging out with you.|A sarcastic Obi-Wan Kenobi, to Vos, as the two hung over a ledge following a fight with Cad Bane|Hunt for Ziro}}
In [[22 BBY]],<ref name="Galactic Atlas" /> the [[Clone Wars]] were sparked during the [[Battle of Geonosis]].<ref name="Episode II">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]</ref> During the Republic's war with the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]], the [[crime lord]] [[Ziro Desilijic Tiure|Ziro]] the [[Hutt]] was imprisoned by the Republic in the [[Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center]] on the [[capital]] planet of [[Coruscant]]. Ziro's crime was to conspire with [[Count]] [[Dooku]], a [[Sith Lord]] and the [[Politics|political]] leader of the Separatist Alliance, in a plot to kidnap [[Rotta]], the infant child of Ziro's nephew [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the Hutt; the plot was designed to implicate the Jedi Order in the kidnapping and intended death of the Huttlet, in order to convince the [[Hutt Clan]] to join the Separatist cause.<ref name="TCWfilm">[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' film]]</ref> The Hutt Clan later paid to have the [[bounty hunter]] [[Cad Bane]] [[Senate hostage crisis|break]] Ziro out of [[prison]], so the Hutt criminal could be imprisoned by the Hutts and not reveal damaging information he had about the [[Grand Hutt Council]] to the Republic.<ref name="Hunt for Ziro" />

[[File:Vos and Obi-Wan on Coruscant.png|thumb|250px|right|On Coruscant, Vos and Kenobi discuss their mission to find Ziro.]]
In order to return Ziro to Republic imprisonment, the [[Jedi High Council|Jedi Council]] assigned Vos and Kenobi, the latter of whom had become a Jedi Master, to track the Hutt criminal down and capture him. Before their mission began, Vos met Kenobi and [[Clone Commander|Commander]] [[CC-2224|Cody]], a [[clone trooper]] in the [[Grand Army of the Republic]], at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. Kenobi suspected that Jabba was behind the escape due to wanting revenge for his son's kidnapping, but Vos had information correctly stating that the Hutt Council was involved due to Ziro's damning information. The two Jedi left Coruscant and made their way to [[Nal Hutta]], the Hutt homeworld, where Vos correctly believed that Ziro had been taken.<ref name="Hunt for Ziro" />

Vos and Kenobi arrived on Nal Hutta and landed at the [[Gardulla the Hutt's Palace|palace]] of [[Gardulla Besadii the Elder|Gardulla]] the Hutt, where Ziro was being held, and were brought before the Grand Hutt Council. Vos confronted the Council with the theory that they broke Ziro out of prison, a theory that the Hutts expressed offense over, despite its accuracy. As the Hutts spoke to Kenobi, who assured them that they meant no harm to the Council, Vos picked up a glass that Ziro had used and was able to sense his memories, telling him that the Hutt had been in the palace. Vos told Kenobi what he had discovered as the two left the Council chambers and the Jedi made their way into the prison, where they soon discovered that Ziro had escaped.<ref name="Hunt for Ziro" />

[[File:VosTrackingZiro-HFZ.png|thumb|250px|left|Vos uses his psychometric tracking skills while searching for Ziro on Nal Hutta.]]
Using Vos' expert tracking skills, Vos and Kenobi ventured through the swamps of Nal Hutta on the trail of Ziro and his lover, the [[musician]] [[Sy Snootles]], who had helped him escape&mdash;and, unknown to Ziro or the Jedi, was being paid by Jabba to bring Ziro's diary of damaging information to him. Kenobi wondered why Ziro would still be on Nal Hutta, suspecting that the Hutt may have left the planet, but Vos sensed that Ziro was still on the Hutt homeworld. While on the hunt, Kenobi was attacked by a [[dragonsnake]], a fearsome creature that lived in the swamps. The Jedi Master killed the large carnivore, leaving Vos to quip that Kenobi was wasting precious time in the hunt for the Hutt escapee. The trail led the Jedi, who discovered that Cad Bane was also searching for the Hutt, towards the [[Mama the Hutt's house|home]] of Ziro's mother, [[Mama]]. Vos and Kenobi learned that Ziro had stolen Mama's [[starship]] and that Bane had arrived soon thereafter and forced her to divulge what she knew about her son's activities. Kenobi assured her that he and Vos did not want to kill her son, and she revealed that Ziro was making his way to the jungle planet [[Teth]]&mdash;where Ziro had hidden his diary.<ref name="Hunt for Ziro" />

[[File:Vosteth.png|thumb|right|220x220px|Vos using his lightsaber on Teth.]]
The Jedi arrived on Teth to find Bane standing over Ziro's corpse, though, when confronted, the bounty hunter rightly insisted that he was not responsible for the murder. Bane attempted to leave, but Kenobi and Vos fought to capture him for his crimes against the Republic, including holding the [[Galactic Senate]] hostage<ref name="Hunt for Ziro" /> as part of his plot to free Ziro.<ref name="Hostage Crisis">{{TCW|Hostage Crisis}}</ref> This led to a [[Showdown on Teth|fight]] between the Jedi and Bane, with Bane able to hold his own against the two Jedi. The Jedi chased Bane across large rock formations that were in the area, and at one point the bounty hunter was able to gain possession of [[Quinlan Vos's lightsaber|Vos' lightsaber]] and use it against Kenobi. Bane grabbed Kenobi's arm during the fight and electrocuted him, but Kenobi was soon saved by Vos, who used jet boots to fly towards Bane and fight him mid-air. The bounty hunter evaded the Jedi Knight and, despite Vos and Kenobi's efforts, flew to his ship and escaped from Teth. Their mission to recover Ziro and capture Bane ended in failure.<ref name="Hunt for Ziro" />

====Yoda's vision====
[[File:Vision of a peaceful Jedi Order.png|thumb|250px|Vos, along with many other Jedi, appears in Yoda's vision of an idyllic Jedi Order.|left]]
Later in the war, [[Grand Master]] [[Yoda]] set out on a journey to unlock the secrets of [[immortality]], which would allow him to [[Force spirit|retain his consciousness]] after death. This journey led him to a mysterious [[Wellspring of Life|planet]],<ref name="Destiny">{{TCW|Destiny (episode)|Destiny}}</ref> the origin of life itself.<ref name="Force planet Databank">{{Databank|force-planet|Force planet}}</ref> He was put through a number of trials by five [[Force Priestesses]], who tested Yoda to determine if he was worthy of their secrets. During the trials, Yoda saw a vision of an idyllic Jedi Order, one that had not become corrupted by years of warfare. Amongst the many Jedi Yoda saw in the peaceful time was Vos, who spoke with Jedi Master [[Saesee Tiin]]. The vision ended once Yoda remembered that what he was seeing was not real, but rather an illusion conjured on the Force planet.<ref name="Destiny" />

====Successful Partnership====
=====Working with Ventress=====
{{Quote|What is this?"<br>"It's called a 'tackle.'"<br>"Who. Are. You?!"<br>"Relax. I've got this one, honey."<br>"Honey?!|Quinlan Vos and Asajj Ventress|Dark Disciple}}
Some time later,<ref name="Timeline Note">The timeline in ''[[Lords of the Sith]]'' places the events of ''[[Dark Disciple]]'', in which the referenced events take place, after the events of the television series ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'', in which the previously-mentioned events take place.</ref> Vos was on an undercover assignment at [[Otor's Hub]]. Disguised as "Master Tal", Vos was tracking [[Sheb Valaad]], an unscrupulous [[Koorivar]] [[merchant]] who specialized in selling the ill-gotten works and objects of deceased individuals; some of whom he had arranged to be murdered. Vos' mission was interrupted by the arrival of the [[Mahran]] Jedi Knight [[Akar-Deshu]] ("Desh"), who had been sent by the Jedi Council to fetch Vos for a new mission. After dispatching Sheb and his henchmen, the two Jedi traveled back to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

Upon arriving back in Coruscant, Vos learned that he had been assigned on a secret mission to assassinate Count Dooku. The Jedi Council had been spurred into action by Dooku's [[Attack on Mahranee|genocidal attack]] on the Mahran homeworld of [[Mahranee]]. Seeking to prevent the further loss of lives, the Council had decided to kill Dooku in order to bring an end the Clone Wars. Vos accepted the mission but insisted on having a partner accompany him. After some discussion, Master Yoda recommended that he team up with [[Asajj Ventress]], a [[bounty hunter]]<ref name="Bounty">{{TCW|Bounty (episode)|Bounty}}</ref> who had once been Dooku's [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]] [[Sith apprentice|acolyte]] and [[assassin]]; before Dooku [[Battle of Sullust|cast]] her aside on the orders of [[Darth Sidious]], the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]].<ref name="Nightsisters">{{TCW|Nightsisters (episode)|Nightsisters}}</ref> The alliance between Vos and Ventress, forged by the Jedi Council, was designed to bring both the [[Light side of the Force|light side]] and dark side together to kill the Count of [[Serenno]], although the Council did not want Ventress to know she was aiding the Jedi.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

Vos's first challenge was to locate Ventress. He did this by traveling to [[Level 1313]] of Coruscant in order to get information as to her location. While there he spoke with the bounty hunter [[Boba Fett]] in a [[Unidentified bar (Level 1313)|bar]] who hinted that his former partner was hunting a [[Volpai]] named [[Moregi]] on [[Pantora]]. Traveling to Pantora, Vos joined forces with Ventress to [[Capture of Moregi|capture]] the Volpai fugitive. After a series of conflicts and misunderstandings, Vos managed to win Ventress over by using his psychometric powers to find Moregi's home. Having captured Moregi, Ventress, believing Vos to be a competent if irritating bounty hunter, agreed to form a partnership. <ref name="Dark Disciple" />

[[File:Pantoran city.png|thumb|290px|right|Pantora, where Vos and Ventress met.]]
The two spent several weeks aboard Ventress's ship, the ''[[Banshee (starship)|Banshee]]'', training and conducting missions. During a mission on Coruscant's Level 1313, Vos on one occasion saved Ventress' life by using the Force to knock a [[blaster]] out a [[Weequay]] thug's hand. On their fifth hunt, Vos and Ventress worked together to capture the estranged former [[Blood Bone Order first mate|first mate]] of the [[Blood Bone Order]]'s [[captain]] [[Lassa Rhayme]]. At Quinlan's suggestion, Ventress managed to bait the fugitive using her feminine charms. As part of their payment, Rhayme gave them a bottle of [[Tevraki whiskey]], which the two hunters enjoyed together. While drinking, Vos questioned Ventress about her training but she remained tight-lipped. The two hunters also began to develop feelings for each other that went beyond their business partnership.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

When Ventress made a business trip to Coruscant's Level 1313 to make modifications to the ''Banshee'', Quinlan took the opportunity to update Master Kenobi about the progress of his mission. Since Vos had established a rapport with Ventress, Kenobi urged his fellow Jedi to find a way to motivate her against Dooku. Vos later learned that Ventress had accepted a new job from the [[Pyke Syndicate]], a drug and [[spice]] cartel that was based on the rocky planet [[Oba Diah]]. The [[Pyke]] Syndicate boss [[Marg Krim]]'s wife [[Tezzka Krim]] and their two children [[Laalee]] and [[Vram (Pyke)|Vram]] had been kidnapped by the [[Black Sun]] crime syndicate and were being held hostage on the volcanic planet [[Mustafar]]. Marg tasked the two hunters with [[Rescue of Marg Krim's family|rescuing]] his family.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

Traveling together to Mustafar, Vos and Ventress rented two [[lava flea]]s and visited a bar called [[The Last Resort (bar)|The Last Resort]]. There, they accosted a [[Falleen]] Black Sun guard and forced him to divulge information about the Pyke hostages. Using this information, Vos and Ventress infiltrated the Black Sun fortress through an exposed balcony outcropping. Despite rescuing Laalee and Vram, they were unable to find Tezzka. Pursued by the Black Sun sentries, the two hunters and the children headed back to their lava flea mounts, which were separated by a high cliff. While Ventress with Laalee managed to jump safely onto their lava flea, a blaster bolt hit Quinlan's back; causing Vram to lose his grip and fall into the lava flow. However, Vos used his Force powers to [[Telekinesis|lift]] the boy to safety before he could touch the lava flow.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

After returning to the ''Banshee'', the two bounty hunters formulated a plan to rescue Tezzka while Ventress treated Vos' wounds. Using his psychometric powers, Vos touched Laalee's locket and discovered that her mother Tezzka was still being held in the fortress. While Ventress entered the fortress disguised as a Pyke Syndicate negotiator, Vos managed to free Tezzka from her cell. Together with Tezzka, Vos rejoined Ventress in the Black Sun leader [[Ziton Moj]]'s throne room where the two hunters assaulted Moj and his men. Having accomplished their mission, the two hunters and Krim's family returned to Oba Diah on the ''Banshee''. During their journey, Vos and Ventress managed to befriend the two children, who regarded the hunters as their rescuers.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

Upon returning to Oba Diah, Marg Krim rewarded Ventress with double the pay. As they departed the planet, the two hunters witnessed a fleet of Black Sun [[starfighter]]s and [[Interceptor-class frigate|''Interceptor''-class frigates]] exiting [[hyperspace]] above the planet. Black Sun had come to settle scores with the Pyke Syndicate in retaliation for the Mustafar rescue. Despite knowing that the Pikes would not stand a chance, Vos wanted to help. However, Ventress knew that they were outnumbered by the Black Sun fleet and took the ''Banshee'' into hyperspace.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

=====Ventress' Disciple=====
{{Quote|Good, Vos. You can now touch the dark side at will. But it's one thing to feel those emotions&mdash;rage, hate, anguish&mdash;and quite another to use them. You must let go of your compassion, and focus on your hatred.''"<br>"''And...use them on a living creature.''"<br>"''Precisely.|Ventress guiding Vos' through his "discipleship"|Dark Disciple}}
[[File:Dark Disciple Cover Detail.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Quinlan Vos partnered himself with the former Sith Acolyte Asajj Ventress to defeat Count Dooku. The two eventually became lovers.]]
Reeling from their failed mission, Quinlan revealed to Ventress that he was a Jedi, a fact that she was already aware of; having observed his unnatural combat prowess and ability to survive even the most lethal incidents as evidence of his Force-sensitivity. With nothing to hide, Vos finally revealed to his true identity and his mission to assassinate Count Dooku. Having come to respect Vos and seeing a potential way to finally get revenge on her former master, Ventress agreed to aid him in his mission, but insisted that assassinating Dooku would not be possible without the aid of the dark side.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

When Vos found an opportunity to travel to Coruscant, he met up with Master Kenobi in the same seedy Level 1313 bar. Vos informed Kenobi that Ventress was aware of his Jedi identity and that she was willing to help assassinate Dooku. He pointed out that Ventress had Separatist contacts who knew Dooku's location. When Vos stated that he trusted the [[Dathomirian|Dathomiri]] bounty hunter, Kenobi cautioned his fellow Jedi not to trust Ventress due to her manipulative nature. In response, Vos asserted that she had been faithful to him for now.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

To guide him in his teachings, Ventress took Vos to her former homeworld, [[Dathomir]], a planet that was steeped in the dark side. After landing the ''Banshee'', Ventress led Vos to the site of the [[Nightsisters]] [[Battle of Dathomir|massacre]] that [[General]] [[Grievous]] had instigated the previous year under the orders of Count Dooku. Vos also learned about Ventress' life story and her desire for revenge against Dooku for the murder of her fellow Nightsisters. After Vos grasped one of the fallen Nightsisters' [[Nightsister energy bow|energy bows]], he experienced a psychometric vision of the Nightsisters massacre and understood Ventress' pain. Despite his feelings for Ventress, Vos still clung to the Jedi teaching to avoid giving into anger. Knowing this, Ventress tried to get her disciple to embrace his hatred; arguing that Jedi doctrine would not bring about Dooku's demise.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

During their time on Dathomir, Ventress exhorted the Jedi Master to use his emotions to strengthen his bonds with the dark side. In Vos' presence, she summoned a [[snake]] to slither over her body before crushing its windpipe using a dark side-fueled [[Force choke]]. When Vos drew an analogy between Ventress' struggle with the death of her Master [[Ky Narec]] and his Master Tholme, Ventress claimed that Dooku had murdered his master in an effort to fuel his anger towards the Count and the Jedi Council for withholding that information. In truth, Ventress had [[Battle of unidentified planet (Tholme and Ventress)|murdered]] Tholme under the orders of Count Dooku. Giving into his emotions and his attraction to Ventress, Vos embraced his partner&ndash;turned&ndash;teacher to signify his rejection of the Jedi doctrine of non-attachment.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

Vos and Ventress set up camp far from the Nightsister's camp after gathering and burying the remains of the fallen Nightsisters. As part of his Dark-side training, Ventress took Vos on frequent climbs to build his strength and agility, hunting trips to make him comfortable with killing, and long runs to build his endurance. As his training progressed, Ventress got Vos to attempt to coax a snake into coiling around him before killing it with the power of the dark side. However, Vos hesitated and he lost control of the snake, which injected him with a powerful hallucinogenic venom that left him in a state of pain.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

The following morning, Vos had barely recovered from his injuries when Ventress engaged him in a [[lightsaber duel]] around the camp and the surrounding forest. During the duel, Vos gave in to his anger. Satisfied with her disciple's progress, Ventress decided that the time was right to instruct him in the ritualistic access to the dark side perfected by the Nightsisters. She also briefed Vos about a Nightsister coming&ndash;of&ndash;age ritual which involved killing and harvesting the body parts of [[the Sleeper]], a large crustacean creature that inhabited a series of pools near the Nightsisters' village. To prepare for this test, Vos had to train underwater in the [[ocean]]s of Dathomir without the use of any [[A99 aquata breather|breathing equipment]] or ocular aids.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

As his training progressed, Vos also continued his romantic relationship with his teacher&ndash;and&ndash;partner. While dining over [[burra fish]] stew, Ventress asked him about what they would do after they had killed Dooku, Quinlan stated that he would not be returning to the Jedi Order after they had completed their mission. Shortly later, they were contacted by Ventress' [[Information broker|informant]], the [[Gossam]] [[Sumdin]], who informed her that Dooku was planning to visit [[Raxus]] soon. Before the duo proceeded with their mission, Ventress tasked Vos with his final trial: the murder of the Sleeper. Despite some initial hesitancy, Vos managed to kill the Sleeper by crushing it with the power of the dark side while visualizing the creature as Count Dooku. After committing the deed, Vos affirmed his love for Ventress and destroyed his [[comlink]]&mdash;his sole link to the Jedi. Together, the duo then proceeded with their mission to kill Dooku.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

=====Taking on Dooku=====
{{Quote|So. She has given you a taste of the dark side ... and perhaps other things as well, I gather. Tell me Vos, how many Jedi vows have you broken to destroy me?|Dooku taunting Vos|Dark Disciple}}
[[File:RaxusLandscape-HOBS.png|right|290px|thumb|Vos and Ventress traveled to Raxus to assassinate Count Dooku.]]
Having completed his training, Quinlan Vos and Asajj Ventress finally set out on their [[Mission to Raxus|mission]]. They left for the Confederate capital, Raxus, where they rendezvoused with Ventress' secret contact Sumdin in Raxus' capital [[Raxulon]]. Vos was horrified when Ventress murdered Sumdin with her [[Ventress's lightsaber|lightsaber]]. In response to Quinlan's protests, Asajj responded that he could not let compassion or any loose ends stop him from carrying out their mission. Vos accepted Ventress' reasoning and used his anger to fuel the mission that lay ahead. The two would-be assassins planned to ambush Dooku at a formal gathering in Raxulon. The Confederacy was conferring the [[Raxian Humanitarian Award]] on Count Dooku, who would also give a patriotic speech in order to boost morale among the local population.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

After the speech, the two assassins devised a plan to confront the Count alone. While Ventress contacted Dooku and told him to meet her alone at the overlook, Vos ambushed General Grievous and his battle droids in order to prevent them from assisting Dooku. After locking Grievous in a chamber, Vos proceeded to join Ventress in carrying out their mission. The two assassins engaged the Separatist leader in a [[Lightsaber combat|lightsaber duel]] but were unable to match Dooku's mastery of the dark side. During the fight, Dooku knocked out Asajj by hurling her against a wall. While parrying with the [[Sith]] Lord, Dooku attempted to sow discord between Vos and Ventress by claiming that he would be a far better teacher than Ventress.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

In the end, Dooku managed to overpower Vos and knock away his [[lightsaber]]. Shortly later, General Grievous arrived with [[battle droid]] reinforcements and drove Ventress away. Defeated and having failed his mission, Vos attempted to goad the Count into killing him. However, Dooku had other plans for his Jedi captive and instead knocked him unconscious with [[Force lightning]]. The last thing that Vos saw before falling unconscious was the sight of Ventress fleeing Dooku's battle droids thus leaving him in Dooku's captivity.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

=====Agent of the dark side=====
{{Quote|Remember... you always have a choice to be better. You always have a choice to... to pick the right path. Even if that choice comes a little late.|Asajj Ventress to Quinlan Vos|Dark Disciple}}
[[File:DookuVilla-Nightsisters.png|thumb|left|275px|Vos was imprisoned and tortured at Dooku's palace on Serenno.]]
Following Quinlan Vos' capture, he underwent extended [[torture]] and psychological manipulation at [[Dooku's palace]] on Serenno. Sensing the darkness already growing within him, the Sith Lord sought to manipulate Vos into becoming his latest apprentice and a tool against the Jedi. Vos initially held out against his captor until Dooku revealed that Ventress had been responsible for the death of his former master, Tholme. Quinlan initially refused to believe Dooku's account until the Count gave him Tholme's lightsaber. Using his psychometric powers, Vos discovered that Dooku had been telling the truth. With his trust in his former lover broken, Vos succumbed to the dark side and agreed to become Dooku's apprentice.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

Despite aligning with Count Dooku and the Separatists, Vos secretly planned to use Dooku to get to his mysterious [[Sith Master|master]] Darth Sidious and to eliminate the Sith once and for all. Meanwhile, Ventress launched a desperate [[Mission to Serenno (Boba Fett's syndicate)|rescue mission]] to Serenno with the aid of her [[Boba Fett's syndicate|former bounty hunting allies]]. While the bounty hunters distracted Dooku's [[droid]] sentries, Ventress made her way into Dooku's prison and managed to find Vos' cell. However, Vos overwhelmed by Dooku's mind games and his hatred towards Ventress, lashed out at his would be rescuer, revealing himself to now be an agent of the dark side. Heartbroken, Ventress was forced to leave Serenno empty handed.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

Now Dooku's servant and consumed by the dark side, Vos began a new life as the deadly Separatist agent, known to the galaxy as '[[Admiral]] Enigma'. For several [[Standard month|months]], Vos utilized his familiarity with the Republic military to orchestrate a series of victories, quickly becoming one of the the Confederacy's most feared operatives. Recognizing that the Jedi Order would soon discover the truth of Enigma's identity, Vos and his new master orchestrated a plan. As anticipated, the Jedi Order, teaming up with Ventress, launched a [[Rescue of Quinlan Vos|mission]] to capture Enigma and hopefully rescue Vos. After fighting Dooku, the strike team discovered the former Jedi battered and broken in a prison cell aboard Enigma's [[flagship]]. While rescuing Vos, Asajj saw his [[eye]]s flash brightly and realized that he had joined the dark side. Despite Ventress's protestations to the contrary, Vos's former Jedi allies believed his deception and welcomed him back to the Order.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

=====Returning to the light side=====
{{Quote|We lost our way. We lost it when we decided to use assassination, a practice so clearly of the dark side, for our own ends... All that has happened since&mdash;Vos succumbing to the dark side, the deaths he has directly and directly caused, the secrets leaked, the worlds place in jeopardy&mdash;all of this can be traced back to that single decision. Masters, I submit to you that Vos' fall was of our making...|Obi-Wan Kenobi speaking up for Vos in a Jedi Council hearing|Dark Disciple}}
[[File:Vanqor landscape.png|thumb|right|250px|Vos sabotaged a Republic military operation on Vanqor.]]
However, Vos' quick reintroduction into the Jedi Order simply acted as a means to an end. To prove his loyalty to Dooku, Vos sabotaged a Jedi [[Destruction of the Separatist supply storage base|operation]] to salvage supplies including medications, weapons, ship-repair parts, and foodstuffs that were being stored in a [[Separatist supply storage base]]. Vos planted several Republic-issue bombs in the asteroid base before the Jedi and Republic could salvage the supplies; effectively denying them to the Republic's people and war effort. Later, Vos leaked intelligence about a joint Republic-Jedi [[Destruction of the Vanqor listening post|military operation]] against a [[Vanqor listening post|Separatist]] [[listening post]] on [[Vanqor]] to Dooku. This enabled the Separatists to evacuate the base before Republic forces arrived.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

While Vos professed shock and ignorance at the failure of these operations, several of his Jedi colleagues particularly Master Windu came to suspect that he was secretly working for Dooku. After some debate among the Jedi Council, Master Yoda ultimately discerned that Vos had indeed fallen after interacting with the former Jedi personally. As a final test of faith, the Jedi Council once again tasked Vos with the assassination of Dooku. Vos, seeing this as an opportunity to defeat [[Darth]] Tyranus and learn the identity of his mysterious master Darth Sidious, accepted the [[Second battle of Christophsis|mission]]. Prior to embarking on the mission, Vos took the opportunity to reconcile with Ventress, asking her to follow him secretly on his mission.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

Unknown to him, the Jedi Order, expecting deception, sent Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Vos' Mahran friend, Desh, to trail him aboard Dooku's [[Providence-class dreadnought|dreadnought]]. Infiltrating the Separatist [[warship]], Vos quickly defeated Dooku and demanded an audience with Darth Sidious before both Sith were promptly captured by the Jedi. Vos tried to protest his innocence but was ignored by Kenobi, who felt hurt by his friend's betrayal. Kenobi and Skywalker brought Vos and Dooku aboard the [[Venator-class Star Destroyer|''Venator''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Vigilance]]'' where they were surrounded by two dozen armed clone troopers led by [[Commander]] Cody. While being led to the ship's brig, Vos was confronted by his old friend Desh, who was hurt by his betrayal.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

Under the pretext of wanting to talk to Desh, Vos lured his former friend to approach him and then used the Force to levitate his lightsaber. Vos then used Desh' lightsaber to break Dooku's bonds and the two dark siders attacked their [[Cloning|clone]] and Jedi captors. Vos engaged in a lightsaber duel with Desh while probing his thoughts. Vos quickly realized that the Mahran planned to sacrifice his own life to kill Vos by breaking his own wrist to release venom from his stinger into Desh's bloodstream. Vos managed to dodge Desh's stinger and hurled him straight at [[Kav Bayons]], killing the other Jedi Knight. As Desh succumbed to his own poison, Vos spared his former friend the agony of a painful death by killing him with his lightsaber.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

[[File:Christophsis landscape.png|left|thumb|250px|Vos along with Ventress and Dooku crash-landed on Christophsis' crystalline surface.]]
Meeting up with a horrified Ventress in the ship's hangar, Vos and Dooku fled aboard the ''Banshee'' and attempted to reach Dooku's dreadnought. However, they were shot down by the ''Vigilance'' and crash-landed on [[Christophsis]]. Vos and his companions survived the crash but sustained various wounds. Pursued by Republic forces, a wounded Dooku guided both Vos and Ventress to a [[Christophsis Separatist tower|Separatist stronghold]]. On the way, Ventress questioned Vos about his collusion with Dooku. Vos tried to assure her that he had a plan and told her to trust him. As promised, Dooku attempted to provide Vos with an audience with his master, but the conversation was cut short by an assault launched by the Republic military.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

After an artillery blast left Ventress wounded, Dooku seized the opportunity to kill both of his former apprentices in one fell swoop. However, in a moment of self sacrifice, Ventress dove in front of a lethal blast of Dooku's force lightning, saving her lover from certain death. Enraged and broken by her sacrifice, Vos defeated Dooku in a fit of passion. Before striking the killing blow, Vos experienced a final moment of clarity and spared the Sith Lord's life. Ventress spent her final moments in her lover's arms declaring her devotion to him even in death and reassured him that the path to redemption was not outside his reach.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

Dooku ultimately escaped in the chaos of the battle, but Vos's actions of mercy were witnessed by Obi-Wan Kenobi. Following the battle, Vos was taken into custody and imprisoned in the ''Vigilance{{'s}}'' brig. Heart-broken by the death of his lover Ventress, Vos did not resist his Jedi and Republic captors. During a hearing at the Jedi Council, Vos confessed that he had fallen to the dark side as part of his plan to find the identity of Dooku's secret Sith master Darth Sidious. Believing that the Jedi decision to resort to assassination was a moral failure, Kenobi advocated for Vos's reinstatement in the Jedi Order, which was granted by the Council although Vos was placed under surveillance until he could earn back their trust. Kenobi and Vos attended Ventress's [[funeral]] on Dathomir, where Vos buried her in the traditional way of her people.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

====Final battles====
{{Quote|Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.|Obi-Wan Kenobi, near the end of the war|Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith}}
The last days of the Clone Wars saw Vos leading military forces in the Grand Army of the Republic. After the [[Siege of Saleucami|fall]] of the planet [[Saleucami]], Vos moved his troops to [[Boz Pity]].<ref name="Episode III" /> Vos would then join the [[Battle of Kashyyyk|fight]] on [[Kashyyyk]], strategizing alongside the [[Wookiee]] [[Chief]]tain [[Tarfful]].<ref name="Card Trader">[[Star Wars: Card Trader|''Star Wars'': Card Trader]]</ref> Shortly thereafter, [[Supreme Chancellor]] Palpatine&mdash;secretly Darth Sidious&mdash;[[Proclamation of the New Order|transformed]] the Republic into the [[Galactic Empire]], the Jedi Order was [[Order 66|destroyed]], and the Clone Wars came to an end.<ref name="Episode III" />

===Presumed survival===
{{Quote|There must be other Jedi left in the galaxy. I have found no record of Kenobi's death, or Yoda's. Perhaps Quinlan Vos survives.|Ferren Barr, to Verla|Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 17: Burning Seas, Part V}}
Following the events of Order 66, Vos was listed among the presumed survivors of the new [[Galactic Emperor]]'s Jedi purge.<ref name="Dying Light I">''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 7: The Dying Light, Part I]]''</ref> During the [[occupation of Mon Cala]], Jedi Padawan [[Ferren Barr]] and [[Verla]], his informal apprentice, escaped an [[Skirmish in Bel City|engagement]] with a trio of [[Inquisitorius]]. As they parted ways following their escape, Barr told Verla to find another surviving Jedi to help train her, listing Vos among the possible survivors she could turn to.<ref name="Dark Lord 17">''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 17: Burning Seas, Part V]]''</ref>

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|That Jedi has quite a reputation."''<br />"''You may be overstating it, Cody. Let's just say he's ''crazy''.|Commander Cody and Obi-Wan Kenobi|Hunt for Ziro}}
[[File:Quinlan Vos Scum and Villainy.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Vos wore distinctive clothing not typical of a Jedi.]]
Quinlan Vos was a [[Kiffar]]<ref name="Databank" /> male with [[Color|black]] hair, brown eyes, and tan skin.<ref name="Hunt for Ziro" /> He had yellow [[tattoo]]s on his face and left arm.<ref name="Dark Disciple Concept Art">{{SW|url=tv-shows/dark-disciple-concept-art-gallery|text=Dark Disciple Concept Art Gallery}}</ref> Vos wore clothing that differed from typical Jedi apparel, including black garb while on Tatooine.<ref name="Episode I" /> During the hunt for Ziro, he wore a traditional Jedi tunic, but it was sleeveless and was complimented by armor on his shoulder and lower arms.<ref name="Hunt for Ziro" />

Vos displayed a sarcastic personality and was known as a maverick who did not always follow the rules of Jedi life.<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" /> He displayed these tendencies while working with Kenobi to find Ziro, cracking jokes and preferring to stick to his own methods for operating on a mission, including his confrontational tone with the Grand Hutt Council.<ref name="Hunt for Ziro" /> As a teacher, he formed a close bond with his Padawan, Aayla Secura, who had to learn to let her master go in order to move on with her life as a Jedi Knight.<ref name="Jedi Crash" />

While working undercover, Vos encountered the dark sider Asajj Ventress and developed a rapport with her. Due to his undercover skills, the Jedi Council handpicked him for a mission to assassinate Count Dooku in an effort to end the Clone Wars. Despite Vos' love and affection for Ventress, he was uneasy with her bloodlust and violence. Vos' determination to complete his mission led him to acquiesce to Ventress' request that he train under her instruction in the dark side of the Force. While Vos was later overcome by hatred towards Ventress for murdering his late Master Tholme, he still loved her enough to reconcile with her. Vos' love for Ventress led him to resolve to leave the Jedi Order after he had completed his mission to kill Dooku.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

Though Vos had apprenticed himself to Count Dooku and inflicted considerable damage on the Republic and Jedi, his main motivation for joining the dark side was to uncover Dooku's hidden master Darth Sidious and destroy the two Sith Lords once and for all. Despite going over to the dark side and causing harm to the Jedi and the Republic, Vos still had feelings for his former colleagues. On one occasion, Vos' friendship with the Jedi Knight Desh led him to give him a merciful death after the latter had poisoned himself in an attempt to recapture Vos. Later, Vos' love for Ventress gave him the strength and will to return to the light side and the Jedi Order.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

==Powers and abilities==
{{Quote|Well, since you're suddenly so interested in my tracking abilities, they went this way.''"''<br />''"''I never doubted you.|Quinlan Vos and Obi-Wan Kenobi, while on the hunt for Ziro|Hunt for Ziro}}
[[File:BaneEscapesTheJedi-HFZ.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Vos and Kenobi fight Bane on Teth.]]
Quinlan Vos was renowned for his psychometry, the ability to sense the memories of other beings by touching objects that they had come into contact with. This allowed the maverick Jedi Knight to become an expert tracker, which he utilized by taking on missions that delved into the galaxy's criminal underworld.<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" /> His dealings with criminals gave him an understanding of how the underworld operated, which helped him to deduce the true nature of Ziro's escape from Republic imprisonment and how the Hutt Council factored into the situation.<ref name="Hunt for Ziro" /> Later, Vos used his psychometric powers to examine his late master Tholmes' lightsaber; which allowed him to identify Asajj Ventress as his master's killer.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

As a Jedi Master, Vos was well versed in lightsaber combat and wielded a green-bladed lightsaber. During the hunt for Ziro, he displayed a prowess with a lightsaber, teaming with Kenobi to take on the infamous bounty hunter Cad Bane.<ref name="Hunt for Ziro" /> Vos was also able to levitate objects and people with his Force powers. On one occasion, he levitated the Pyke child Vram from a lava flow on the volcanic planet of Mustafar, saving the boy from serious burns or death. Under Ventress' tutelage, Vos learned how to tap into the power of the dark side of the force. On one occasion, he was able to fight even though he had been bitten by a poisonous snake. Later, he was able to levitate and kill the Sleeper, a large crustacean creature, by harnessing the dark side.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

While Vos was proficient enough to use the Force hide the fact that he had embraced the dark side, he was unable to deceive everyone. His lover Asajj recognized his dark side alignment after noticing that his eyes flashed with hatred. Later, Yoda was able to discern during a private conversation with Vos that the Master had indeed turned to the dark side. Despite embracing the dark side, Vos was able to return to the light due to his love for Asajj Ventress.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

==Behind the scenes==
{{Quote|In much the same way that Aayla Secura caught Lucas' eye enough to prompt the director to include the comic's character in Episode II, Lucas was intrigued by Quinlan Vos.|[[Pablo Hidalgo]]|Star Wars Insider 85}}
[[File:QuinEp3.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Quinlan Vos, in a deleted animatic from ''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith''.]]
Quinlan Vos was based on a background character who appeared in the streets of Mos Espa in the [[1999]] film [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']], written and directed by ''[[Star Wars]]'' creator [[George Lucas]]. The character was created, based on this appearance, by author [[John Ostrander]] and artist [[Jan Duursema]]. Ostrander created the character's name by patterning it off of Qui-Gon Jinn's name, as Ostrander wanted a name with the same number of syllables.<ref name="Vos Name Origin">{{Cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=18972|title=OSTRANDER USES THE FORCE IN "VECTOR"|first=Jeffrey|last=Renaud|work=Comic Book Resources|date=November 28, 2008|accessdate=June 2, 2015}}</ref> Vos went on to prominently appear in a number of [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] stories, including ''[[Star Wars: Republic]]''.<ref name="Republic 17">''[[Star Wars 17: Emissaries to Malastare, Part 5]]''</ref> The background character was officially [[retcon]]ned as being Vos in the official ''Star Wars'' [[canon]].<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" />

The character, as fleshed out in the Expanded Universe, eventually caught Lucas' eye. The director was intrigued by Vos and decided to include him in the [[2005]] film [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]. The character was scripted to appear on the planet Kashyyyk, the Wookiee homeworld, during the execution of Order 66, but the scene was never photographed.<ref name="Trivia>{{SW|url=tv-shows/clone-wars/hunt-for-ziro-trivia-gallery|text="Hunt for Ziro" Trivia Gallery}} {{C|Slide 1}}</ref> An animatic featuring Vos was developed, however,<ref name="Insider85">{{InsiderCite|85|Ask Lobot|Ask the Master}}</ref> that featured him with a squad of clones on a [[HAVw A6 Juggernaut]] at the time of Order 66.

[[File:Vos Ventress Dark Disciple Concept Art.png|thumb|200px|right|Vos, Ventress, and Dooku, in concept art for the episodes that formed the basis for ''Dark Disciple''.]]
Vos later appeared in "[[Hunt for Ziro]]," the ninth episode of the [[The Clone Wars: Season Three|third season]] of the animated television series ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'',<ref name="Hunt for Ziro Episode Guide">{{SW|url=tv-shows/clone-wars/hunt-for-ziro|text="Hunt for Ziro" Episode Guide - The Clone Wars}}</ref> in which he was voiced by [[Al Rodrigo]].<ref name="Hunt for Ziro" /> Vos was previously slated to appear in the [[The Clone Wars: Season One|first season]] episode "[[Bombad Jedi]]," where where he would have been working undercover and using his Force abilities to help [[Jar Jar Binks]] appear to be a Jedi. His appearance was cut because, at the time, the production had a limited ability and limited amount of time with which to create new character models.<ref name="Vos Bombad Info">{{Cite web|url=http://theforce.net/jedicouncil/interview/henrygilroyanddavefiloni.asp|title=Interviews - Face to Face with the Masters|accessdate=June 2, 2015}}</ref>

Although "Hunt for Ziro" was Vos' only appearance on ''The Clone Wars'', he was slated to be part of a number of episodes featuring a team-up between him and Asajj Ventress. The episodes, eight in total,<ref name="Shapiro Interview">{{Cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/2015/03/11/mtfbwy-7-star-wars-books-editor-teases-future-your-favorite-book/|title=MTFBWY #7: Star Wars Books Editor Teases Future, Your Favorite Book|work=ComicBook.com|first=Lucas|last=Siegel|date=2015-03-11|accessdate=2015-03-22}}</ref> formed a single story arc<ref name="Golden One Arc">{{Twitter|ChristieGolden|status/579837584890851328|[[Christie Golden]]|quote=No, it was one long arc.
