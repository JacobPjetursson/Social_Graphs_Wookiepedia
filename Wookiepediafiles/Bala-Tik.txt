'''Bala-Tik''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] who worked as a negotiator for the [[Guavian Death Gang]]. He handled a deal with the famed [[smuggler]] [[Han Solo]] by paying for Solo to haul [[rathtar]]s, a deal that Solo also made with [[Kanjiklub]].

==Biography==
===Associate of Solo===

[[File:Bala-Tik SWDA.png|left|thumb|200px|Bala-Tik.]]
The [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] Bala-Tik served the criminal [[Guavian Death Gang]]<ref name="TFA VD" /> as a leader<ref name="TFA novel">[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)|''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' novelization]]</ref> and frontman during the reign of the [[New Republic]]. During his time with the gang, he encountered the [[smuggler]] [[Han Solo]] and managed to shake several profitable leads out of him,<ref name="TFA VD" /> although Solo let the Guavians down at least once.<ref name="Episode VII" /> The smuggler eventually took out a loan of fifty thousand [[credit]]s from the gang in order to hunt [[rathtar]]s for [[King]] [[Grevoth Prana IX|Prana]]; however, he failed to pay it back within a timely manner and the leaders of the gang soon became tired of his delays and excuses.<ref name="TFA VD" /> Less than a [[Standard year|year]] before the [[First Order]]'s [[Attack on Tuanul|attack]] on the village of [[Tuanul]] in [[34 ABY]],<ref name="Date">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' dates the [[attack on Tuanul]] to [[34 ABY]], and ''[[Before the Awakening]]'' establishes that [[Poe Dameron]] joined the [[Resistance]] less than a [[Standard year|year]] prior. Since Dameron is a Resistance member in ''[[Poe Dameron 9: The Gathering Storm, Part II]]'', it can be deduced that the events of the comic occurred less than a year before the attack on [[Tuanul]].</ref> Bala-Tik was on the [[planet]] [[Kaddak]] on the [[Level 45|forty-fifth level]] of the [[city]] known as [[the Sliver]] with three [[Guavian security soldier]]s.<ref name="PD9">''[[Poe Dameron 9: The Gathering Storm, Part II]]''</ref>

While in the Sliver, the Guavians were approached by four members of [[Kanjiklub]],<ref name="PD9" /> a criminal group with whom the gang were often in conflict.<ref name="TFA VD" /> Kanjiklub's leader, [[Tasu Leech]],<ref name="TFA VD" /><ref name="PD9" /> had overheard the [[protocol droid]] [[C-3PO]] mention that Solo had borrowed money from the Guavian Death Gang,<ref name="PD9" /> and revealed to Bala-Tik that the smuggler had also borrowed fifty thousand credits from Kanjiklub to hunt rathar. The two groups of criminals found common ground in their hatred of Solo and agreed to confront him together over his debts,<ref name="TFA VD" /> with Leech and Bala-Tik shaking hands on the agreement.<ref name="PD9" />

===Debt collector===

[[File:Guavian Death Gang.png|thumb|right|250px|Bala-Tik and his team boarded the ''Eravana''.]]
In 34 [[Galactic calendar|ABY]], Bala-Tik and a group of security soldiers caught up with Solo while he was hunting on the planet [[Nantoon]] and then followed him<ref name="TFA VD" /> in a nonmilitary [[transport]]<ref name="TFA novel" /> when he left the world in his [[Baleen-class heavy freighter|''Baleen''-class heavy freighter]] ''[[Eravana]]''.<ref name="TFA VD" /> Solo, who was unaware of the criminals pursuing him, traveled to the [[Western Reaches]] in order to locate his old [[YT-1300 light freighter]] the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. The ''Eravana'' stopped in the [[Jakku system]], where a tracker onboard the ''Falcon'' had signalled from, and managed to pick up the [[freighter]]. Shortly after the ''Falcon'' was pulled onboard the ''Eravana'', Bala-Tik and the Guavians revealed themselves by docking with Solo's freighter.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Bala-Tik and a five-man team of security soldiers disembarked their [[Starship|ship]] and began marching through the ship until they found Solo and his co-[[pilot]] [[Chewbacca]] in one of the ''Eravana's'' corridors. The frontman demanded Solo repay them their money, also revealing that he knew about the loan from Kanjklub. The smuggler claimed Kanjiklub were lying, to which Bala-Tik responded that Solo could tell that to the group himself. Five members of Kanjiklub then revealed themselves in the corridor behind Solo, led by Leech. The smuggler promised both groups that he would deliver what he owed them, but Bala-Tik and Leech were unimpressed due to his previous work for them.<ref name="Episode VII" />

===Runaway rathtars===

[[File:Bala-Tik_flees.png|thumb|left|Rathtars attacked Bala-Tik and his men on the ''Eravana''.|250px]]
Bala-Tik then noticed the [[BB-series]] [[astromech droid]] [[BB-8]], who was hiding between Solo and Chewbacca. Remembering that the group known as the First Order was searching for a similar BB unit and two fugitives, Bala-Tik pointed out BB-8, causing Kanjiklub to start searching the ship for the fugitives. Before Bala-Tik could make a move for the [[droid]], the three rathtars that Solo had caught on Nantoon were set free by [[Rey]] and [[Finn]], the two fugitives that Bala-Tik had mentioned who had been on the ''Falcon'' when Solo found it. Hearing the rathtars roar, Bala-Tik ordered his men to kill Solo and Chewbacca and grab BB-8; however, one of the rathtars attacked his team from behind before they could open fire<ref name="Episode VII" /> and grabbed two of the soldiers.<ref name="TFA novel" />

Bala-Tik and his remaining men fled forward toward Solo and then down a corridor to their left<ref name="Episode VII" /> while the rathtar killed the pair it had grabbed.<ref name="TFA novel" /> Kanjiklub were also attacked by a rathtar and forced to flee, allowing Solo and his companions to escape.<ref name="Episode VII" /> Bala-Tik managed to regroup with one member of his gang in one of the ship's corridors to take account of their losses, although as he spoke the frontman witnessed a third member of his gang being killed by a rathtar and was forced to flee while firing ineffectually at the beast.<ref name="TFA novel" /> Solo managed to reach the ''Falcon'' with Chewbacca, BB-8, Finn and Rey and then escape onboard it, killing one of the rathtars in the process. Bala-Tik witnessed the ''Falcon'' depart through one of the ''Eravana's'' hangar doors and then gave orders via [[comlink]] that his men should contact the First Order and warn them that Solo had the droid.<ref name="Episode VII" />

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Your game is old. There's no one left in the galaxy for you to swindle.|Bala-Tik loses his patience with Solo|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}
[[File:Bala-Tik_on_comlink.png|thumb|right|Bala-Tik was willing to aid the First Order.|250px]]
Bala-Tik stood 1.8 [[meter]]s tall<ref name="Databank" /> and had fair skin, [[Color|brown]] [[eye]]s and brown [[hair]]. He spoke with a harsher form of the clipped accent commonly found in the galactic [[Core Worlds]]. He had a [[Cyborg|cybernetic]] left [[Limb|leg]], which he concealed. Bala-Tik frequently used Solo and Chewbacca as sources of information, a relationship that he valued for the Death Gang despite growing increasingly impatient with the Corellian smuggler's schemes. He knew enough about Solo to bring several guards with him aboard the ''Eravana'', believing Solo to be foolish enough to start a [[blaster]] fight near a ship's [[airlock]].<ref name="TFA VD" />

Bala-Tik was a confident and experienced individual, not one to waste time on false pleasantries. When he met Solo on the ''Falcon'', he was bursting with barely controlled anger and spoke in clipped tones.<ref name="TFA novel" />

==Equipment==
Like all Guavians, Bala-Tik carried the latest in [[black market]] weapons technology. This included a [[percussive cannon]] manufactured by [[Tostovin Munitions]], which fired particularly explosive blaster bolts. He wore a black [[gorraslug]]-[[Gorraslug-leather|leather]] [[Clothing|long coat]] with [[armor]]ed lining, a pair of black [[sparadillo armored boot]]s and a pair of ribbed black [[pants]] that concealed his [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] right [[Limb|leg]].<ref name="TFA VD" />

==Behind the scenes==
Bala-Tik was portrayed by Scottish actor [[Brian Vernel]] in the [[2015]] film [[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']].<ref name="Episode VII" /> The [[Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)|novelization]] of the film written by [[Alan Dean Foster]] contains notable differences to the film in terms of Bala-Tik's dialogue, with most of his lines being extended. During his initial interaction with Solo, the smuggler suggests that the Guavians accompanying him in bringing the rathtars to Prana so that they can claim the reward together, but Bala-Tik rejects the idea as he believes Solo will try and escape. As these scenes contradict the amount of dialogue shown in the film, this article assumes them to be non-[[canon]].<ref name="Episode VII" /><ref name="TFA novel" />

===LEGO appearances===
{{Quote|And he shot [[Greedo]]!''"<br />"''I heard Greedo shot first.''"<br />"''Oh&hellip; them's fighting words!|Bala-Tik and Leech disagree over who shot first|Hunting for Han}}
Bala-Tik also appeared in two episodes of the non-[[canon]] series of video shorts ''[[LEGO Star Wars: The Resistance Rises]]'' voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]]. In the episode "[[Hunting for Han]]", Bala-Tik brings a pair of [[musical instrument]]s to the [[Maz Kanata's castle|castle]] of [[Maz Kanata]], which Kanata had hired him to locate. The frontman then demands that in exchange for the instruments, Kanata must tell him where Han Solo is so that he can track him down to reclaim his debt. As the pair discuss Solo's debt, Tasu Leech and several Kanjiklub members enter the castle enter the castle also demanding to know where Solo is. Leech, Bala-Tik and several other patrons of the castle argue over who has the greatest claim to vengeance on Solo which quickly turns into a full on brawl.

Kanata then ends the fighting by using a [[lightsaber]] to partially collapse part of the castle's roof on the fighters. To prevent further fighting, Solo's old friend [[Lando Calrissian]] directed the fighters to Jakku to search for Solo. Bala-Tik quickly leaves with the other patrons, forgetting to collect the instruments he had brought Kanata.<ref name="HfH">{{The Resistance Rises|Hunting for Han}}</ref> In the following episode, "[[Rey Strikes Back]]", Bala-Tik and his comrades arrive on Jakku onboard a [[Resistance transport]] and immediately spot the ''Millennium Falcon''. The group races toward it, but are run down by [[Rey's speeder]] before they can reach it.<ref name="RSB">{{The Resistance Rises|Rey Strikes Back}}</ref>
