{{Quote|Whoever heard of a bander who didn't gamble?|Figrin D'an|Ultimate Star Wars}}
"'''Fiery'''" '''Figrin D'an''' was a [[Sexes|male]] [[Bith]] [[musician]] who played the [[Kloo horn]] as frontman and leader of the [[band]] [[Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes]].

==Biography==
A [[Sexes|male]] [[Bith]] [[Reproduction|born]] on the [[species]]' [[homeworld]] of [[Bith (planet)|Bith]], Figrin D'an proved to have a fine aptitude for [[music]] and high manual dexterity for playing a range of instruments,<ref name="USW" /> and became the bandleader and organizer of the all-Bith [[band]] [[Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes]].<ref name="SWCT" /> D'an favored the [[Kloo horn]], although could also play a mean [[Gasan string drum]].<ref name="USW" /> He proved overbearing and compulsive to his band-mates, although the Modal Nodes earned a reputable standing in the music industry, and achieved reasonable success on the [[The galaxy|galactic]] circuit. However, the band largely remained an entertainment feature on the [[Outer Rim Territories]], theorized to be due to the lack of vocals in their tracks.<ref name="SWCT" /> In particular, they became a popular fixture at [[Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina]] in [[Mos Eisley]] on [[Tatooine]],<ref name="USW" /> where patrons preferred D'an's work on the Gasan string drum over his usual Kloo horn.<ref name="Modal Nodes Databank">{{Databank|figrin-d-an-and-the-modal-nodes|Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes|archivedate=20170602113800}}</ref>

Shortly before the [[Battle of Yavin]], D'an and the Modal Nodes played<ref name="ANH" /> their most recognizable tune<ref name="Databank" /> "[[Mad About Me]]"<ref name="Absolutely Everything">''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know]]''</ref> on stage in [[Chalmun]]'s [[cantina]], although their performance was interrupted by [[Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] slicing off the arm of the [[Aqualish]] [[Ponda Baba]] in defense of the young farmboy [[Luke Skywalker]]. Once the incident was over, the band began playing again as the cantina's patrons returned to their drinks.<ref name="ANH" />

==Personality and traits==
As a Bith, Figrin D'an had a fine aptitude for music and boasted a high manual dexterity, allowing him to play a range of instruments.<ref name="USW" /> While head of the Modal Nodes, Figrin D'an was overbearing and compulsive, although the band managed to maintain a reputable standing in the music industry.<ref name="SWCT" /> Nonetheless, Figrin was a rocking frontman, and his deft playing of his Kloo horn earned him the nickname "Fiery" Figrin.<ref name="Databank" />
