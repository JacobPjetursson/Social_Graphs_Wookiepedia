{{Quote|Sir! They've gone up the ventilation shaft!|Tey How|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace}}
'''Tey How''' was a [[Sexes|female]] [[Neimoidian]] who served as a [[battleship]] [[pilot]] for the [[Trade Federation]] during their [[blockade]] and subsequent [[Invasion of Naboo|invasion]] of the [[planet]] [[Naboo]]. During the initial blockade, How piloted the Federation [[flagship]] ''[[Saak'ak]]'' and gave her superiors [[Daultay Dofine]] and [[Nute Gunray]] various reports and warnings concerning a pair of [[Jedi]] [[ambassador]]s from the [[Galactic Republic]] who the Federation tried to [[Death|kill]] aboard the vessel.

After the Jedi escaped and the full invasion of Naboo began, How transfered to piloting the [[droid]] control ship ''[[Vuutun Palaa]]''. She activated the [[battle droid]] army deployed to fight the [[Gungan Grand Army]] during the [[Battle of Naboo]], but was killed when the child pilot [[Anakin Skywalker]] managed to fly an [[N-1 starfighter]] into the interior of the ''[[Vuutun Palaa]]'' and destroy its main [[reactor]].

===Jedi escape===

Tey How was a [[Neimoidian]] [[Sexes|female]] who served the [[Trade Federation]] during their [[Invasion of Naboo|blockade]] of the [[planet]] [[Naboo]] over a trade dispute<ref name="The Phantom Menace" /> in the [[Standard year|year]] [[32 BBY]].<ref name="Date" /> She was stationed as the [[pilot]]<ref name="Complete Locations">''[[Star Wars: Complete Locations (2016)|Star Wars: Complete Locations]]''</ref> of the [[Lucrehulk-class LH-3210 cargo freighter|''Lucrehulk''-class LH-3210 cargo freighter]] ''[[Saak'ak]]'' under the command of [[Captain]] [[Daultay Dofine]], which served as the [[flagship]] of the Federation fleet.<ref name="The Phantom Menace" /> How was seated in the navigation station<ref name="Complete Locations" /> on the bridge when the [[Jedi]] [[ambassador]]s [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] arrived onboard the ''Saak'ak'' to negotiate the end of the [[blockade]] on the behalf of [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Finis Valorum]] of the [[Galactic Republic]].<ref name="The Phantom Menace" />
[[File:Tey How Gunray Haako and Sidious.png|thumb|right|250px|How served under Viceroy Nute Gunray.]]
After Trade Federation [[Viceroy]] [[Nute Gunray]] tried to [[Death|kill]] the Jedi using [[poison]]ous [[dioxis]] gas, a [[squad]] of [[B1 battle droid]]s was sent to make sure they were dead; however, How reported to her superiors that contact had been lost with the squad after the [[battle droid]]s were quickly destroyed by the Jedi. Panicked by the loss of the [[droid]]s, Gunray ordered How to seal off the bridge and then to close the [[blast door]]s once Jinn started to cut through the bridge doors with his [[Qui-Gon Jinn's lightsaber|lightsaber]]. The Jedi were forced to cease their attempt to reach the bridge once a pair of [[droideka]]s attacked them, and How reported that they had moved into the ship's vents.<ref name="The Phantom Menace" />

===A deadly transfer===
{{Quote|We're losing power. There seems to be a problem with the main reactor.''"<br />"''Impossible! Nothing can get through our shields.|How and Dofine discover that the control ship is about to explode|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace}}
[[File:Activate the droids.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Tey How activated the droid army.]]
As the Jedi slipped aboard one of the Federation's [[C-9979 landing craft|landing craft]] and escaped the ''Saak'ak'', How informed Gunray that they were receiving a transmission from [[Queen]] [[Padm√© Amidala]] of Naboo on the surface below. After Amidala refused to give into the Federation's demands, droid forces were deployed to invade the surface of Naboo. How was then still present on the bridge when Gunray's master [[Darth Sidious]] contacted him via [[hologram]] for an update on the invasion's progress, in which Gunray chose to avoid mentioning the escape of the two Jedi.<ref name="The Phantom Menace" />

[[File:Tey How death.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The destruction of the ''Vuutun Palaa'' killed Tey How.]]
As the takeover of Naboo proceeded, How and Dofine transferred from the ''Saak'ak'' to the bridge of the [[Lucrehulk-class Battleship|''Lucrehulk''-class Battleship]] ''[[Vuutun Palaa]]''. When the [[Gungan Grand Army]] gathered to oppose the Trade Federation's invasion in [[Battle of Naboo|battle]], Dofine ordered How to activate their droid army on surface below. During the ensuing battle, the child [[Anakin Skywalker]] [[pilot]]ed a [[N-1 starfighter]] into the interior of the ''Vuutun Palaa'' and fired [[missile]]s into the vessel's main [[reactor]].<ref name="The Phantom Menace" />

How reported that the ship was losing power due to the apparent damage, but Dofine refused to believe anything had made it through the [[battleship]]'s [[Deflector shield|shields]]. The captain's confidence was misplaced however, and the bridge erupted around them along with the rest of the ship, killing How and other members of the crew.<ref name="The Phantom Menace" />
