'''Riley''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|female]] [[thief]] active during the [[Imperial Era|reign]] of the [[Galactic Empire]]. Riley and her [[The Smuggler|younger sibling]] were orphaned on the [[mining]] colony of [[Burnin Konn]]. The two were renowned for their skill as thieves until Riley was injured in a fall from a building, after which she gained a [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] leg brace to compensate for her injury. She became mostly a planner following this incident.<ref name="PlayUprising" />

==Behind the scenes==
Riley was consistently depicted as a fair-skinned human in the game's promotional material.<ref name="Uprising Launch">{{SW|url=video/star-wars-uprising-launch-trailer|text=Star Wars: Uprising Launch Trailer}}</ref><ref name="New Galaxy">{{SW|url=news/star-wars-uprising-puts-you-in-a-whole-new-galaxy|text=''Star Wars: Uprising'' Puts You in a Whole New Galaxy|archivedate=20170813153940}}</ref> Consequently, the present article treats her as such.
===Physical Appearance===
In ''[[Star Wars: Uprising]]'', the appearance of Riley depends on what species and skin tone/color the player chooses for [[The Smuggler|their character]]. Riley's gender does not change in correlation with The Smuggler's gender.<ref name="Uprising" />
