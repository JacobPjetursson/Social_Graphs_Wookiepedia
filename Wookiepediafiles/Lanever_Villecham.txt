==Biography==
[[File:Korr Sella final moments.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Chancellor Villecham with Commander Korr Sella moments before they are killed by Starkiller Base's superweapon.]]
Lanever Villecham served as a delegate to the [[Galactic Senate (New Republic)|Galactic Senate]] of the [[New Republic]], hailing from the [[Tarsunt system]]. [[33 ABY|Twenty-nine]] [[Standard year|years]] after the [[Battle of Endor]], Villecham was elected to serve as the Senate's [[Chancellor (New Republic)|chancellor]]. He focused his term in office on improving trade relations with neutral systems in the [[Trans-Hydian Borderlands]], as they had been disaffected from the Republic for [[Standard decade|decades]]. His [[time]] in office also saw the rise of the [[First Order]], a successor to the [[Galactic Empire]]. Villecham did not consider the First Order a threat so long as they abided by the dictates of the [[Galactic Concordance]], a peace treaty marking the Empire's defeat to the Republic at the end of the [[Galactic Civil War]]. This was in contrast to the claims of [[General]] [[Leia Organa]] and the [[Resistance]], who urged the Republic to consider military action against the resurgent Imperial power. Organa dispatched an envoy, [[Commander]] [[Korr Sella]], to the Republic's then [[capital]] of [[Hosnian Prime]] to argue for a military build-up, but by then it was too late.<ref name="TFA VD" /> Villecham, Sella, and the Senate were [[Hosnian Cataclysm|wiped out]] when the First Order targeted their [[superweapon]], [[Starkiller Base]], on Hosnian Prime and destroyed it.<ref name="Episode VII" />
