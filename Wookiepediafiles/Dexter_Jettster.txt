'''Dexter "Dex" Jettster''', nicknamed '''Dexi Jet''',<ref name="Smuggler's Guide">''[[Star Wars: Smuggler's Guide]]</ref> was a [[Sexes|male]] [[Besalisk]] with a colorful background who lived on the [[planet]] [[Coruscant]] and was the owner of [[Dex's Diner]].<ref name="Dexter" /> Serving mostly hard workers from the area, the diner offered home-style cooked meals and freshly brewed [[ardees]] ("Jawa juice"). Jettster worked as the cook and employed two waitresses, [[Hermione Bagwa]] and her [[WA-7 waitress droid]] partner, [[FLO]].<ref name="Diner">{{Databank|dexs-diner|Dex's Diner|archivedate=20170225081024}}</ref>

It was shortly before the [[Clone Wars]] that [[Jedi Knight]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] came to Dex's Diner to see if his old friend, Jettster, could identify a poisoned dart. Though few even knew of the planet [[Kamino]], Jettster did from his days as a [[prospector]] and was able to identify the dart as originating from that planet. Furthermore, he knew of the native inhabitants, the [[Kaminoan]]s, who were [[Cloning|cloners]] of some repute and kept to themselves but were welcoming to those who brought [[credit]]s. Jettster gently chided his old friend Kenobi who as a Jedi should have put more faith in another person's wisdom than the knowledge of the [[Jedi Archives]].<ref name="AotC">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]</ref>

==Biography==
Before the [[Clone Wars]], [[Dex's Diner]] was known to have the best [[nerfburger]]s ever, and people from all over [[the galaxy]] traveled to [[Coruscant]] to eat at Dex's. Unfortunately, not all of Jettster's clientele was trustworthy, as [[Sexes|he]] was. [[Thief|Thieves]] sometimes stole nearby, so Jettster enlisted the help of his [[Jedi]] friend, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]. Kenobi and Jettster set up a sting in the diner itself to stop the robberies. When the thief, [[Tri Tellon]], pickpocketed a trinket from Kenobi, Jettster and Kenobi tracked Tri to [[Tri Tellon's home|her hideout]] that she shared with another rogue, [[Magreda]]. Jettster now owed a favor to Kenobi, one that would be paid.<ref name="Stop, Thief!">{{IDWAdventuresCite|1|[[Tales from Wild Space: Stop, Thief!]]}}</ref>

It was right before the [[Cloning|Clone]] Wars began that Jettster was approached by Kenobi, who wanted to know if Jettster could identify a [[Kamino saberdart|poison dart]]. Jettster was able to identify the dart, which was from the [[planet]] [[Kamino]]. Jettster and Kenobi exchanged friendly banter, and then Kenobi left the diner.<ref name="AotC" />

==Personality and traits==
Jettster was 1.88 [[meter]]s tall, with a [[Color|brown]]-black mustache, yellow [[eye]]s, and tan-brown skin.<ref name="Dexter" />

==Behind the scenes==
Dexter Jettster was voiced by Ronald Falk in his debut, Attack of the Clones.<ref name="AotC" /> He was originally written to be married to his waitress, Hermione Bagwa.<ref>{{DB|character|hermionebagwa|Hermione Bagwa}}</ref>
