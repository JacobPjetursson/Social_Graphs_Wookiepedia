'''Zutton''',<ref name="Alien Archive">''[[Star Wars: Alien Archive - Species Guide]]''</ref> also know as '''Snaggletooth'''<ref name="CT" /> was a [[Snivvian]] present in [[Chalmun's Cantina]] on the [[planet]] [[Tatooine]]<ref name="EP4">[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]</ref> during the [[standard year]] [[0 BBY]].<ref name="GA">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]''</ref> While walking the streets of [[Mos Eisley]], Snaggletooth wore a [[Color|red]] [[Clothing|tunic]] over a black shirt along with light-colored [[pants]] and [[boot]]s. The Snivvian had light-colored skin, black [[eye]]s, and brown [[hair]].<ref name="EP4" /><ref name="CT" />

==Behind the scenes==
The name "Snaggletooth" dates back to the original [[Kenner Products|Kenner]] ''[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' [[Star Wars (toy line)|toy line]], in which an action figure based on the Snivvian was given the name.<ref name="Kenner">{{KennerCite|set=Star Wars (toy line)|text=''Star Wars''|pack=Snaggletooth|link=VINtSnaggletooth.asp}}</ref> Later sources which are now identified as belonging to the [[Canon|''Star Wars'' Legends]] timeline noted that the name Snaggletooth was actually a nickname, and that the [[Sexes|male]] Snivvian's real name was [[Zutton]]. The first canon source to provide Snaggletooth's name was the ''[[Star Wars: Card Trader]]'' mobile [[video game]], as the character is otherwise unnamed in their only appearance, ''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope''.<ref name="CT" />

Although the character in the film wears a red-colored shirt, the original Kenner toy featured blue clothing. The figure's clothing was changed to red during the toy line's production run, as was the figure's height. Snaggletooth's general appearance later served as inspiration for [[Katt Mol]], a Snivvian character who appeared in the [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' television episode]] "[[Padawan Lost]]."<ref name="Episode Guide">{{SW|url=tv-shows/clone-wars/padawan-lost-episode-guide|text="Padawan Lost" Episode Guide - ''The Clone Wars''|org=theclonewars/guide/episode321.html}}</ref>
