'''Unkar Plutt''', a member of the [[Sexes|male]] [[Crolute]] [[species]], resided on the remote, lawless world of [[Jakku]] approximately 30 [[Standard year|years]] after the [[Battle of Endor]]. The Crolute was a [[junk boss]] who bought weapons, gears and scraps of Rebel and Imperial ships which had crashed during the [[Battle of Jakku]]. The ruthless Unkar used hired [[Unkar's thugs|thugs]] to enforce his stranglehold on barter, sending them to punish any [[scavenger]] who dared dabble in unauthorized trades or negotiated too aggressively. '''The Blobfish'''&mdash;as scavengers called him behind his broad back&mdash;had collected all manner of weapons, gears, and ships over the years, including a battered [[Millennium Falcon|Corellian freighter]] he kept under a tarp on the outskirts of [[Niima Outpost]]. From his [[Concession Stand]] at [[Niima Outpost]], he ruled over the lives of the scavengers, buying and selling scrap and doling out survival rations.

==Biography==
===Birth===
Unkar Plutt was born on the aquatic world of [[Crul]]. He claimed to have left after a business deal fell through, then drifted from place to place until eventually ending up on [[Jakku]].<ref name="True Love Chapter 4">"[[True Love]]" Chapter 4</ref>

===Early dealings===
[[File:Garbagell Do SoR.png|left|thumb|250px|The ''Millennium Falcon'' in Plutt's junkyard outside Niima Outpost]]
Unkar Plutt established himself on [[Jakku]] sometime after the [[Battle of Jakku]], making a living trading salvage for [[Foodstuff|food]] rations to local [[scavenger]]s and reselling the parts to [[spacer]]s that wanted to buy parts off-the-books. Roughly sixteen [[Standard year|years]] after the [[Battle of Endor]], a [[youngling]] who called herself [[Rey]] was left with him on Jakku.<ref name="Episode VII" /> Rey worked for Unkar directly until she began coordinating with other scavengers. The young teen eventually struck out on her own, becoming one of the best scavengers on Jakku. Because of that, Unkar's thugs had orders to make sure she was left alone.<ref name="Rey's Survival Guide">''[[Rey's Survival Guide]]''</ref>

At some point in his career, Unkar stole a [[YT-1300 light freighter]] from the [[Irving Boys]], which turned out to be the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. Over Rey's objections, Unkar installed a [[compressor]] and primer in the [[Starship|ship's]] systems. The ship would sit in Unkar's yard for years under a tarp.<ref name="Episode VII" /> Plutt also organized a failed mission to collect valuables from [[Carbon Ridge]], rumored to house a hidden [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] base. Stung by the failure, Plutt never talked about it again.<ref name="Rey's Survival Guide" /> Plutt arranged for a shuttle depositing credits with an offworld banking service to be robbed, crippling the small minority of scavengers who chose to sell their scrap to offworlders for currency instead of going to him.<ref name="True Love Chapter 1">"[[True Love]]" Chapter 1</ref>

About 30 years after the Battle of Endor, Unkar had bought out or driven out his competition in Niima Outpost, creating a monopoly for his business.<ref name="awakensjunior">[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: A Junior Novel|''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' A Junior Novel]]</ref> Even the Constabulary answered to him. Unkar had total control over [[Niima Outpost]].<ref name="Rey's Survival Guide" /> He controlled the most [[water]], and the most wealth, of anyone on Jakku.<ref name="True Love Chapter 1" />

===Junk boss of Jakku===
{{Quote|The Blobfish sits behind his barred window all day, examining junk, muttering to himself,  and yelling at his goons as if he's afraid that we scavengers would tear him apart if he set one blobby foot outside.|Rey about Unkar Plutt|Rey's Survival Guide}}
[[File:Unbar Plutt TFA.png|thumb|right|300px|Unkar Plutt, junk boss of Jakku.]]
As Niima Outpost's only [[junk boss]], Unkar spent most of his time doling [[ration pack]]s to scavengers from his stall in the [[Concession Stand]] in exchange for their salvage.<ref name="awakensvisual">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> He almost never left the stand, because the harsh environment of Jakku disagreed with his aquatic nature.<ref name="True Love Chapter 1" /> It was widely believed that most of his resources were stored in the stand, although some suspected the real wealth was hidden elsewhere.<ref name="True Love Chapter 2">"[[True Love]]" Chapter 2</ref>

Sometime before the [[attack on Tuanul]], Plutt was kidnapped by [[Zool Zendiat]] and his gang, who were searching for a [[J9]] droid which had been sold to Plutt.<ref name="Devil 1">''[[Better the Devil You Know, Part I]]''</ref>

At some point, two of Plutt's minions attempted to acquire info from him using a [[Tanandra Frullich|sophisticated AI]]. Plutt captured them and took the AI for himself as an assistant, although he often threatened to delete it.<ref name="True Love" />

One day, Rey came to sell salvage accompanied by a [[BB-8|droid]], one that Unkar recognized as being one wanted by the [[First Order]].<ref name="awakensnovel" /> He offered to buy the droid for 60 portions, but Rey refused. Again, he bargained the droid for 100 portions, but to no avail. Refusing to take "''No''" for an answer, Unkar dispatched two of his [[Unkar's thugs|thugs]] to steal the droid. Rey easily subdued them.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Unkar didn't have a chance to form another plan to steal Rey's droid, since almost immediately after Rey defeated his thugs, the [[First Order]] began an [[Escape from Jakku|attack]] on Niima Outpost. In the commotion of the [[stormtrooper]]s and [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighers]], Unkar watched as Rey, the droid, and a defecting [[stormtrooper]] named [[Finn]] hijacked the ''Millennium Falcon'' from his yard. His screams that the ship was his were ignored.<ref name="Episode VII" />

===Confrontation on Takodana===
{{Quote|I'm gonna make you and that worrisome droid pay for what you've done.|Unkar Plutt to [[Rey]]|Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)}}
[[File:Young Rey with Unkar Plutt.png|left|thumb|245px|A young Rey clutched by Unkar Plutt in Rey's vision.]]
Unwilling to lose the ''Millennium Falcon'', Unkar and his thugs trailed the ship to [[Maz Kanata's castle]]. There, he assaulted Rey physically, wanting the ship back and revenge on his former scavenger and the droid for the misery they caused him. Rey attempted to fight back, but neglected to remove the [[safety]] on her [[blaster]]. The commotion, however, caught the attention of the [[Wookiee]] [[Chewbacca]], one of Rey's new friends, who had recovered the ''Falcon'' along with Solo shortly after Rey and Finn's departure from Jakku. When Chewbacca indicated that he would fight him if he did not release Rey, Plutt laughed it off, wondering what a lone Wookiee could do against him and his thugs, reason for which he started to touch repeteadly the Wookiee's injured arm. Furious, Chewbacca demonstrated succinctly why it wasn't wise to upset a Wookiee by ripping off one of Plutt's arms, which landed in a near table at the castle.<ref name="awakensnovel" />

Later, when experiencing her [[Force vision]] at the basement [[Maz Kanata]]'s castle after touching the [[Skywalker's lightsaber]], Rey saw her childhood self being left in Unkar's charge for the first time.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Sometime after the [[Battle of Starkiller Base]], Chewbacca started to fix the unadvised modifications made by Plutt to the ''Falcon'' whilst Rey was being trained by [[Jedi Master]] [[Luke Skywalker]] on [[Ahch-To]].<ref name="lastjedinovel">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: Expanded Edition]]''</ref>

==Personality and traits==
A hulking [[Crolute]], Unkar Plutt was the ruthless junk [[boss]] of Jakku, often using hired muscle to enforce his stranglehold on barter and sending his thugs to punish any scavenger who dared dabble in unauthorized trades or negotiated too aggressively. This attitude eventually earned him the nickname of "The Blobfish" by many scavengers behind his broad back.<ref name="Unkar Plutt" />

Despite his attitude, Unkar used to be somewhat polite when doing business sometimes, especially with Rey, calling her "My Girl" or "Sweetheart" when dealing with her, like when he negotiated with her the possibility of selling BB-8, though she ultimately refused. He didn't like, however, to have scavengers disputing the value of their finds.<ref name="awakensnovel" />

Unkar also was not used to taking orders or respecting anyone, a trait that was demonstrated when he ignored the Wookiee Chewbacca's warning about not harming Rey, taking advantage of the injured shoulder of Rey's friend, touching repeteadly the bandage that covered the Wookiee's wound. This, however, cost Unkar one of his arms, as the Wookiee ripped it off for his insolence.<ref name="awakensnovel" />

==Behind the scenes==
Unkar Plutt was portrayed by [[Simon Pegg]] in [[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']]. Pegg is a frequent collaborator with director [[J.J. Abrams]] and his production company, [[Bad Robot Productions]], having also appeared as [[Wikipedia:Benji Dunn|Benji Dunn]] in Abrams's ''Mission: Impossible'' trilogy and [[MemoryAlpha:Montgomery Scott (alternate reality)|Scotty]] in his ''Star Trek'' films. Plutt is Pegg's second ''Star Wars'' role; he had previously provided the voice of [[Dengar]] in two episodes of ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]''. Pegg was also initially announced to be reprising his role as Unkar in [[Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VIII ''The Last Jedi'']],<ref>[http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/ready-player-one/253869/simon-pegg-negotiating-to-join-ready-player-one-adaptation-by-steven-spielberg Simon Pegg Negotiating to Join Ready Player One Adaptation by Steven Spielberg] at [http://www.denofgeek.com Den of Geek!]</ref> but neither he nor his character were featured in the finished version of the film, though Unkar still got a mention in [[Jason Fry]]'s [[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: Expanded Edition|novelization]] for the film.

In the animated microseries ''[[Star Wars: Forces of Destiny]]'' and the non-canon video game ''[[Disney Infinity 3.0]]'', Unkar Plutt is voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]].

In the film's [[Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)|novelization]], Rey refuses Plutt's offer to purchase BB-8, instead bargaining upward before finally accepting a much higher offer. She then, however, changes her mind. When Plutt gets upset, she puts him in his place, earning the respect of many other individuals at the Niima Outpost, but likely burning her bridges with him for good. This likely plays a large part in the confrontation with him at Maz Kanata's castle that later occurs in the novelization. The novelization also describes in detail Rey's general disgust with Plutt and his operation.<ref name="awakensnovel" /> In the [[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: A Junior Novel|junior novelization]], Rey bargains up to 100 portions, which is quickly accepted. However, when Plutt tells her "''That's my girl''," she changes her mind and tells him that "''conditions have changed''," feeling that turnabout is fair play, given the number of times he's changed deals on her. He tells her that she's nothing, but she ignores him and walks away, earning glances of respect from many of the others in Niima Outpost.<ref name="awakensjunior">[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens (junior novelization)|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'' junior novelization]]</ref> A scene in which Chewbacca rips off Plutt's arm was filmed for ''The Force Awakens'', but ultimately deleted from the final cut. This scene was included in the film's novelization.<ref name="ewdeleted">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/18/star-wars-force-awakens-deleted-scene-unkar-plutt-chewbacca|title=''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' deleted scene: Unkar Plutt enrages Chewbacca|first=Anthony|last=Breznican|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|date=October 18, 2016|accessdate=October 18, 2016}}</ref>
