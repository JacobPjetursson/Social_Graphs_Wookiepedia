'''CC-1004''', nicknamed "'''Gree'''," was a [[Clone Commander]] in the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] during the [[The galaxy|galactic]] conflict known as the [[Clone Wars]]. Gree was born and raised on the planet [[Kamino]] as a [[Cloning|clone]] of the [[bounty hunter]] [[Jango Fett]], and under the command of [[Jedi General]] [[Luminara Unduli]], Gree led the [[41st Elite Corps]] in a number of battles. After [[Padmé Amidala]] and [[Jar Jar Binks]] successfully apprehended [[Trade Federation]] [[viceroy]] [[Nute Gunray]] on [[Rodia]], Gree was tasked with escorting the viceroy back to [[Coruscant]]. He failed, however, and Gunray escaped with the help of [[Asajj Ventress]] and [[Senate Commando]] [[captain]] [[Argyus]].

Later in the war, Gree and Unduli commanded the 41st in the [[Second Battle of Geonosis]]. Alongside the [[501st Legion]], led by [[Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Clone Captain]] [[Rex]], they led an attack on [[Poggle the Lesser]]'s [[Geonosis primary droid foundry|droid foundry]] in an attempt to provide a distraction for [[Padawan]]s [[Ahsoka Tano]] and [[Barriss Offee]]. The distraction was successful, and Tano and Offee were able to destroy the foundry and the newly produced [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist]] [[Super tank]]s.

In the final days of the Clone Wars, Gree and Unduli were on [[Kashyyyk]], where they were assisting the [[Wookiee]]s in their [[Battle of Kashyyyk|defense]] against the [[Separatist Droid Army]]. [[Jedi]] [[Grand Master]] [[Yoda]] had also arrived on the planet, and he and Gree watched the battle unfold from an elevated command center. Gree received [[Order 66]] from [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]] during the battle, which commanded him to eliminate his Jedi Generals. He was forced to comply, but before he could carry out the order, Yoda sensed a disturbance in [[the Force]] and quickly decapitated the clone commander.

Gree participated alongside [[Green Company]] when they rescued Naboo Senator [[Padmé Amidala]], Representative [[Jar Jar Binks]], and their protocol droid, [[C-3PO]], from Separatist leader [[Viceroy]] [[Nute Gunray]] following their [[Mission to Rodia|mission]] to [[Rodia]]. They also captured Gunray. Gree, along with Luminara Unduli and Padawan [[Ahsoka Tano]], were stationed on the ''[[Tranquility]]'' to escort Gunray to Coruscant to stand trial. However, the [[Sith]] acolyte [[Asajj Ventress]] boarded the ''Tranquility'' [[Rescue on the Tranquility|to rescue]] or kill Gunray before he spoke a word to the [[Galactic Republic|Republic]]. Gree assisted Unduli in defeating the [[B2 super battle droid|super battle droids]]. He then guarded Gunray with [[Senate Guard]] [[Senate Commando|Commando]] captain [[Argyus]]. However, Argyus betrayed Gree and freed Gunray. Gree alerted Unduli and Tano to Argyus' betrayal. Despite knocking Argyus out, Gree was then knocked out by Gunray. The two of them escaped.<ref name="Cloak of Darkness" />

====Battle of Kashyyyk and Order 66====
{{Quote|It will be done, my lord.|Gree, responding to Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine's execution of Order 66|Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith}}
[[19 BBY|Nineteen]] [[standard year|years]] before the [[Battle of Yavin]], in the closing days of the Clone Wars, the [[Mid Rim]] planet of [[Kashyyyk]] came under attack by Separatist forces. [[Grand Master]] [[Yoda]] intended to assist in the defense of the world, as he had good relations with the native [[Wookiee]] populace, and so travelled to the planet accompanied by Gree, Unduli and the 41st Elite Corps.<ref name="Revenge of the Sith" />

[[File:TheDeathofCommanderGree.png|thumb|left|220px|Yoda after beheading Gree]]
Gree and Yoda oversaw the battle from a command post in the great tree city of [[Kachirho]]. The pair were joined by the city's ruler [[Tarfful]], as well as another Wookiee named [[Chewbacca]]. Partway into the [[battle of Kashyyyk|battle]], Gree received a transmission from [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]], who ordered him to execute [[Order 66]], a command that forced clones to execute their Jedi commanders. Gree and a [[clone scout trooper]] also present on the command post took position behind the Jedi Master and prepared to execute him. However, Yoda sensed this betrayal, and beheaded Gree and the scout trooper before they could put him down.<ref name="Revenge of the Sith" />

===Legacy===
Because of Gree's assassination attempt on the Jedi Master during the Battle of Kashyyyk, Yoda was made aware of the [[Jedi Purge]] and was able to avoid it.<ref name="Revenge of the Sith" /> Around [[2 BBY|17]] years after his death, the helmet worn by Gree during the Battle of Kashyyyk was part of the private art collection owned by [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]] of the [[Galactic Empire]], and was stored aboard his [[flagship]], the ''[[Chimaera]]''.<ref name="Through Imperial Eyes"> {{Rebels|Through Imperial Eyes}}</ref>

==Personality and traits==
As a clone of the bounty hunter Jango Fett, Gree stood at 1.83 meters and had brown eyes with tanned skin. He also cut his hair into two rectangular stripes, both of them dyed red. Commander Gree was a very loyal soldier. This was shown when he advised Ahsoka Tano to not go against Luminara Unduli's command.<ref name="Cloak of Darkness" /> He also fought and defeated Captain Argyus because of his betrayal. Commander Gree also had respect for his Jedi commanders and clone brothers; he never spoke ill of them and never put a toe out of line.<ref name="Weapons Factory" />

==Equipment==

He also carried a set of personal green-colored [[macrobinoculars]].<ref name="Revenge of the Sith" /> Like many commanding officers, Gree carried a variety of weapons and tertiary weaponry. He carried a [[DC-15A blaster]];<ref name="Revenge of the Sith" /> he was also equipped with one [[DC-17 hand blaster]] (complemented by a holster on the side of one leg) compared to the two pistols some other commanding officers like Captain Rex wielded.<ref name="Weapons Factory" />
