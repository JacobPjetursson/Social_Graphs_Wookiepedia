{{Quote|I mean, he was brave, sure, but always in the service of saving his own hide or profit. But I had also detected that deep down, behind all that smooth talking and those well-ironed capes, there was a whole human being with a conscience and a desperate need to do something worthwhile with his life.|[[Kaasha Bateen]], on Lando Calrissian|Last Shot}}
'''Lando Calrissian''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] [[smuggler]], [[gambler]], and card player who became [[Baron Administrator]] of [[Cloud City]] and, later, a [[general]] in the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]]. He was the owner of the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' before losing it to [[Han Solo]] in a game of [[sabacc]]. After losing the ''Falcon'', Calrissian put an end to his days as a smuggler and became an entrepreneur, setting up a small [[mining]] operation on the [[planet]] [[Lothal]] before eventually becoming the leader of Cloud City in the skies of the planet [[Bespin]].

During the [[Galactic Civil War]], [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] arrived on Cloud City in order to lay a trap for his son, [[Luke Skywalker]]. As part of the trap, the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] forced Calrissian into tricking a group of Rebels, including Solo and [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Organa]], leading them to Vader himself. Though Vader promised to leave Cloud City without an Imperial presence, Calrissian felt the deal had been altered to the point where he could no longer tolerate it. Calrissian alerted his citizens to the [[Galactic Empire]]'s presence and impending occupation, and he ordered an evacuation. He helped the Rebels try to rescue Solo, who had been [[Carbon-freezing|frozen]] in [[carbonite]], from [[Boba Fett]], but the [[bounty hunter]] escaped.

Calrissian joined the Rebel Alliance and set out to find Solo. After locating him in the [[Jabba's Palace|palace]] of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the [[Hutt]] on [[Tatooine]], Calrissian aided in his [[Rescue of Han Solo|rescue]]. The Rebels returned to the fleet and Calrissian became a general, volunteering to lead the assault on the [[Death Star II]] during the [[Battle of Endor]]. During the battle, he piloted the ''Millennium Falcon'' into the battle station's core, firing the shot which destroyed it.

[[File:Img-swsolo-char1.png|thumb|225x225px|left|Young Lando Calrissian]]
Lando Calrissian was [[Reproduction|born]] on the [[planet]] [[Socorro]]<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" /> approximately thirty [[Standard year|years]] before the [[Battle of Yavin]].<ref name="Visual Guide Battles" /> During [[Sexes|his]] youth, he became a [[smuggler]] and a [[gambler]], playing a card game known as [[sabacc]]. He traveled throughout [[the galaxy]] and [[pilot]]ed a [[freighter]] called the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'',<ref name="Databank">{{Databank|lando-calrissian|Lando Calrissian|archivedate=20140703012422}}</ref> which saved his life on numerous occasions.<ref name="Episode V" /> Sometime before [[10 BBY]], Lando won a [[Unidentified subtropical moon|subtropical moon]] in the [[Oseon Belt]] during a game of [[Sabacc]].<ref name="Solo" />

[[Time|Sometime]] prior to the Battle of [[Yavin]], Lando and his droid companion [[L3-37]] were [[Ambush in the Halthor sector|ambushed]] in the [[Halthor sector]] when an Imperial [[Interdictor vessel|interdictor]] dropped out from [[hyperspace]]. As a result of the ambush, Calrissian lost a majority of his shipment of [[walker]]s that he acquired from an [[Er'Kit (species)|Er'Kit]] [[arms dealer]] in the [[Noonian sector]].<ref name="Commander">''[[Star Wars: Commander]]''</ref> Lando also had dealings with [[Crimson Dawn]]'s agent, [[Qi'ra]] on [[Felucia]]. He completed his debt to Crimson Dawn and it's leader, [[Dryden Vos]].<ref name="Solo" />

====Freeing slaves====
[[File:Kristiss and Lando.png|thumb|right|250x250px|Lando meeting with Kristiss]]
Calrissian later smuggled weapons to [[Petrusia]] after the Empire [[Seizure of Petrusia|seized]] control of it. Following that operation, Calrissian considered turning the ''Falcon'' into a [[casino]], despite L3's reservations about it. He also started to write the ''[[Calrissian Chronicles]]'' to show the [[galaxy]] his prodigiousness. Calrissian and L3 then took the ''Falcon'' to [[Batuv]]. There he tried to by a new [[cape]] from [[Borkus (Trandoshan)|Borkus]] until he met the [[bartender]] [[Kristiss]]. She told Calrissian of her [[Petrusian|people's]] plight and status as slaves at the [[Imperial outpost of Kullgroon|Imperial outpost]] on [[Kullgroon]]. Kristiss asked for his help in arming her people for 1,000 [[credit]]s up front. Despite his reservations, Calrissian decided to speak with her and have drink with her.<ref name="Double or Nothing 1" />

Calrissian was confronted by [[Brushaun]], who believed that cheated him out of 2,000 credits in a card game on [[Canto Bight]]. Calrissian was saved by Kristiss, who offered him the credits to pay off Brushaun and more if Calrissian helped her people. Calrissian spoke with L3 about this mission. Knowing he would be a dead man, Calrissian excepted Kristiss' mission. Enroute to Kulgroon, Calrissian and the ''Falcon ''came under attack by several [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]]. Calrissian and L3 were able to lead the TIEs to a moon, where he was able to pick them off. The ''Falcon'' then arrived at Kullgroon.<ref name="Double or Nothing 1" />

[[File:KullgroonWastelands.jpeg|thumb|216x216px|left|Lando arrives at Wastelands Of Kullgroon abord the ''Millennium Falcon'']]
Calrissian powered the ''Falcon'' down in order to appear as space junk in order sneak past the Empire. As the ''Falcon'' descended into Kullgroon's [[atmosphere]], he and L3 were able to pilot the ship in to the [[Wastelands Of Kullgroon|wastelands]]. Calrissian, Kristiss, and L3 then made their way towards the camp. After Kristiss got herself captured by a pair of stormtroopers, Calrissian considered abandoning the mission. L3 convince him to stay. He then came under attack by some outlaws and starfighters. Calrissian was able to find a abandoned star fighter and attempted to evade them. Unfortunately he was shot down and taken prisoner by the outlaws.<ref name="Double or Nothing 2">''[[Lando: Double or Nothing, Part II]]''</ref>

[[File:Lando fighting in arena.JPG|thumb|245x245px|right|Lando about to fight Murkel Kev, Canto Zain, Kawal Trane, and Siswan in a arena battle.]]
The outlaws' leader, [[Batalla]], remembered Calrissian from [[Calladus Festival]], where he took the bulk of the [[Zakku Rain Cartel]]'s credits. Calrissian said it was actually Batalla's prize [[Sharropon]]. He tried to convince Batalla that he was on vacation and was visiting a friend. Batalla considered handing Calrissian over to one of his enemies for a king's ransom. Calrissian was taken to a jail cell. When a droid came with [[Foodstuff|food]], Calrissian was able to trick the droid and disable it. As he made his escape, Calrissian contacted L3 for a pick up. However, L3 was busy looking for Kristiss. He then ran into Batalla's outlaws who threw into a arena. There, Calrissian came against several members of the [[Zakku Rain Cartel]]: [[Murkel Kev]], [[Cantor Zain]], [[Kawal Tane]] and [[Siswan]]. Calrissian fought them until L3 and the ''Falcon'' arrived and returned to the ship. However, L3 wanted to pick up Kristiss despite Calrissian's protests. The ''Falcon'' came under attack by indigenous creature, but Calrissian and L3 was able to steer past them. He contacted Kristiss to arrange the weapons dropoff. Unfortunately, L3 pickup-ed several TIEs closing in on the ''Falcon''.<ref name="Double or Nothing 3">''[[Lando: Double or Nothing, Part III]]''</ref>

[[File:Lando leads Petrusians.JPG|thumb|263x263px|left|Lando leads Petrusian slaves against stormtroopers]]
Calrissian flew the ''Falcon'' low into the wastelands' canyon, hoping to fool the TIEs into believing that the ''Falcon'' crashed. Lando was able to cause a explosion that sealed off the canyon from the TIEs. He took the ''Falcon'' to a sewage expulsion port. As Calrissian made his way through the port, he was confronted by several creatures and shot at them. He was then confronted by the creatures mother, but was able to kill it. Calrissian was able to reach a control station and told L3 to hack into the mainframe to find Kristiss and disable Level 7 to 9's security monitors. Calrissan met up with Kristiss and her father. He then rallied the other Petrusians to take arms against the Empire, despite their resistance to warfare. Calrissian and the slave made their escape to the sewage port and met up with the ''Falcon''. After the slaves armed themselves, Calrissian and Kristiss led them against the stormtroopers.<ref name="Double or Nothing 4">''[[Lando: Double or Nothing, Part IV]]''</ref>

[[File:L3 and Lando.jpg|thumb|252x252px|right|Lando fighting alongside L3 on Kullgroon]]
Calrissian and the Petrusians fought the outpost's stormtroopers. When L3 told him that several TIEs were retuning to the outpost, Calrissian believed it was time for him to retreat when the Petrusians were losing their battle. However, Kristis reactivated hundreds of derelict droids to help them win the battle. Calrissian and [[Rythus]] charged the stormtroopers and saved Kristiss from them. He and [[Kristiss]] used a cord to swing over the stormtroopers. He then met up with L3 and saw the stormtroopers taking the ''Falcon''. After the battle, Calrissian and L3 met up with Kristiss and the slaves as they boarded a [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle|Imperial shuttle]]. He accepted a ride from Kristiss and her father, who gave him his payment. Calrissian learned from L3 that the ''Falcon'' was taken and impounded on [[Vandor]]. A week after this, Calrissian and L3 found the ''Falcon'' on Vandor. There, he decided to go into early retirement and play Sabaac at [[the Lodge]]. <ref name="Double or Nothing 5">''[[Lando: Double or Nothing, Part V]]''</ref>

====Coaxium heist====
[[File:Lando sabacc game with Solo.jpg|thumb|235x235px|left|Lando about to play Sabacc with Han Solo]]
During Lando's retirement on Vandor,<ref name="Double or Nothing 5" /> [[Tobias Beckett]], [[Han Solo]], and [[Chewbacca]] and [[Qi'ra]], who was an old acquaintance of Lando needed a fast [[Starship|ship]] in order to steal unrefined [[coaxium]] from the [[Pyke Syndicate|Pykes]] on [[Kessel]] for [[Dryden Vos]] of [[Crimson Dawn]]. They found him hustling several bar patrons at sabacc by hiding [[Sylop|a card]] up his sleeve. Solo joined in the game, and the stakes soon became the ''Falcon'' against a [[VCX-100 light freighter]] by Solo. Solo produced an impressive hand that caused the other bar patrons to erupt in applause, but Calrissian produced a superior hand by cheating. Calrissian inquired where Solo's ship was, but Qi'ra intervened, explaining the situation. Calrissian agreed to pilot the ''Falcon'' for the heist, in exchange for a 25% cut, negotiated down to 20% by Beckett.<ref name="Solo" />

[[File:Lando & L3-37.JPG|thumb|243x243px|right|Lando and L3-37 about to jump to lightspeed]]
Calrissian and L3-37 [[Raid on Kessel|navigated]] the ''Falcon'' to Kessel, Calrissian remained on the ship during the heist to update
his autobiography. When Solo, Qi'Ra, Chewbacca, Beckett, and L3 returned with the coaxium, Calrissian helped lay down covering fire against the [[Pyke]]s until L3 was shot. Calrissian attempted to save L3, but was shot in the arm, and it took the efforts of Solo and Chewbacca to save him and L3. Aboard the ''Falcon'', L3 [[Death|died]] in a distraught Calrissian's arms. Due to his injury, Calrissian allowed Solo to pilot the ''Falcon'' off Kessel.<ref name="Solo" />

The crew encountered an [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] [[blockade]] when departing Kessel, causing Solo to divert his course into the dangerous [[Akkadese Maelstrom|maelstrom]]. Calrissian retrieved L3's central [[processor]] and plugged it into the ''Falcon's'' [[Navigation computer|navicomputer]] in order to plot a course out of the maelstrom, in which navigation was otherwise impossible. The ''Falcon'' crew encountered a massive [[Summa-verminoth|space creature]], and [[Maw Cluster|the Maw]], a powerful [[gravity well]]. Solo launched the ''Falcon's ''escape pod into the [[gravity]] well, causing the creature to follow it and become trapped. The ''Falcon'' became trapped in the gravity well, only escaping when Beckett used a drop of coaxium in order to give the ''Falcon'' the power to escape.<ref name="Solo" />

====Savareen and Departure====
{{Quote|She is a hell of a ship.''"<br />"''I hate you.''"<br />"''I know.''"<br />"''I'm going to be on ''my ship'', in ''my quarters'', waiting for you to bring me ''my share''. And then I don't ever wanna see you again.''"<br />"''Never?|Han Solo and Lando Calrissian on Savareen|Solo: A Star Wars Story}}
When the crew arrived at the refinery on [[Savareen]] in order to refine the coaxium, Calrissian abandoned the others in the ''Falcon'' when [[Enfys Nest]] and her [[Cloud-Riders]] arrived on Savareen to confront Beckett.<ref name="Solo" />

====Losing the ''Falcon''====
{{Quote|You really have it bad for the ''Falcon'', don't you?''"<br />"''It's mutual, trust me. She belongs with me.|Lando Calrissian and Han Solo|Solo: A Star Wars Story}}
[[File:Lando on Numidian Prime.JPG|thumb|262x262px|left|Lando on Numidian Prime.]]
Solo and Chewbacca later tracked Calrissian to [[Numidian Prime]], where he was once again hustling others at sabacc. Solo swiped Calrissian's spare card when he greeted him, and won the ''Falcon'' in a rematch, leaving with it.<ref name="Solo" />

After losing the ''Falcon'', Calrissian put an end to his days as a smuggler. He fancied himself a respectable businessman,<ref name="Databank" /> and referred to himself as a "galactic entrepreneur." When he was 26,<ref name="Visual Guide Battles" /> Calrissian met a criminal known as [[Azmorigan]], who introduced him to [[Cikatro Vizago]], a [[Devaronian]] [[crime lord]] who operated on the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] planet of [[Lothal]]. Calrissian purchased a [[Lando Calrissian's farm|plot of land]] from Vizago on Lothal, on which the former smuggler intended to begin [[mining]] precious [[mineral]]s. In order to do so discreetly, without attracting the attention of the Empire due to Imperial mining regulations, Calrissian planned to acquire [[Lando Calrissian's puffer pig|a]] [[puffer pig]] from Azmorigan; puffer [[pig]]s had a [[nose]] for minerals and could do the same job as twelve mining scanners. He required a ship that could evade the Imperial blockade set up around the planet; Calrissian attempted to smuggle mining equipment onto Lothal but was stopped by the Empire.<ref name="Idiot's Array">{{Rebels|Idiot's Array (episode)|Idiot's Array}}</ref>

====Hiring the Spectres====
{{Quote| Name's Calrissian. Lando Calrissian. Now please, introduce me to my new droid.|Lando Calrissian|Idiot's Array (episode)}}
Calrissian found such a ship after playing a game of sabacc in [[Jhothal]], a settlement on Lothal. He played the game in [[Old Jho's Pit Stop]], competing against [[Tsoklo]] and [[Garazeb Orrelios]], the latter of whom was a [[Lasat]] [[Spectres|crew member]] aboard the ''[[Ghost]]'', a ship operated by a band of rebels on Lothal. Orrelios believed he had the upper hand and bet his crew's [[astromech droid]], [[C1-10P]], but Calrissian beat his hand by using an [[Idiot's Array]]. The [[droid]], nicknamed Chopper, therefore belonged to Calrissian, but he agreed to give the droid back and pay the rebels much-needed credits if they assisted him on an operation&mdash;which, unknown to them, was the acquisition of the puffer pig. The crew was reluctant to trust Calrissian, but they needed the credits and wanted Chopper returned to them, so they agreed; Calrissian spent much of the time using a divide and conquer strategy, trying to play the rebels against each other so he could accomplish his goals. During the trip to rendezvous with Azmorigan, Chopper gave Calrissian a tour of the ship, where he admired the artwork of [[Sabine Wren]], a [[Mandalorian]] [[artist]] and member of the crew. Calrissian used this as part of his strategy, flattering the Mandalorian's work in order to make himself look good.<ref name="Idiot's Array" />

[[File:Lando on the Ghost.png|thumb|252x252px|right|Lando Calrissian aboard the ''Ghost'']]
Once the ''Ghost'' arrived at the rendezvous, the ship docked with Azmorigan's vessel, ''[[Merchant One]]''. Calrissian and the crew's leaders, [[Hera Syndulla]] and [[Kanan Jarrus]], boarded ''Merchant One'', and Calrissian told them to follow his lead. Calrissian also hinted that the ship had [[escape pod]]s&mdash;a coded message to Syndulla, whom he intended to hand over to Azmorigan as payment for the puffer pig, and he knew that she would need a way to escape the vessel. Despite Jarrus' protests, Syndulla played along once Calrissian offered her to the crime [[lord]], and Azmorigan gave Calrissian the puffer pig, which was locked in a crate. Calrissian and Jarrus returned to the ''Ghost'', where Calrissian explained that he expected Syndulla to use an escape pod to leave ''Merchant One''&mdash;which she did, returning to the ''Ghost'' and attracting the ire of the crime lord. Once Syndulla was aboard, and had given Calrissian a piece of her mind over the betrayal via a knee to the groin, the ''Ghost'' jumped back into hyperspace, leaving Azmorigan behind them.<ref name="Idiot's Array" />

Calrissian showed the crew the puffer pig and warned them not to let it out of its cage, as it would expand into a larger creature if it was startled. Orrelios and fellow crew member [[Ezra Bridger]] ended up letting it out, and the pig ran throughout the ''Ghost'' before being so startled that its size increased and it became stuck in one of the ship's hallways. This proved potentially problematic once the ''Ghost'' [[Mission to Lando Calrissian's farm|returned]] to Lothal, where they needed to slip through the Imperial blockade; Syndulla, the ship's pilot, was stuck on the other side of the pig, so Jarrus would need to pilot the vessel himself. Calrissian asked Chopper, who only responded to Calrissian's commands, to fix the mechanism that would allow the ''Ghost'' to mask its signature and slip past the blockade. Chopper was able to do so and the ship nearly made it through the blockade, but the pig expanded again, knocking Orrelios into the controls that allowed the ship's signature to remain masked. The Empire detected the ''Ghost'' as a rebel vessel and sent a group of [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]] in pursuit, which the ''Ghost'' was able to destroy.<ref name="Idiot's Array" />

[[File:Lando bids farewell.png|thumb|236x236px|left|Calrissian bids farewell to the ''Ghost''.]]
The crew made their way to the [[farm]] that Calrissian purchased from Vizago, where Calrissian explained that his plan was to use the puffer pig for mining. They were confronted by Azmorigan, however, who had anticipated that Calrissian would return to the land. This led to a shootout between the rebels and Azmorigan's forces, one that ended when Azmorigan threatened to kill Orrelios if they did not hand Calrissian over to him. Syndulla refused, and Chopper&mdash;who stole a crate of [[fuel]] for the ''Ghost'' and returned to the ship&mdash;fired the cannons on the ''Ghost'' at Azmorigan, giving Orrelios a chance to gain an upper hand and hold Azmorigan at gunpoint. Syndulla demanded that the crime lord leave, a demand that he acquiesced to. With Azmorigan gone, Calrissian claimed that he did not have the credits that he owed the rebels, but he did return Chopper to them. Nonetheless, Syndulla held Calrissian in her debt, though what he did not reveal was that he knew Chopper had stolen the fuel, which was why he did not give them any credits. He did, however, believe that he would one [[Standard day|day]] meet the rebels again.<ref name="Idiot's Array" />

====Dealing with the Varluk Organization====
[[File:Lando and W1-LE.JPG|thumb|right|225x225px|Lando finds out his Puffer pig has been stolen by the Varluk Organization.]]
Sometime later, Calrissian and [[Rikarda]] were traveling to the planet [[Klonoid]], aboard the ''[[Stellar Sun]]''. During the jounrey, his droid [[W1-LE]], who he had left to watch over his puffer pig and the farm, said that the farm was attacked by raiders who stole Calrissian's pig. Calrissian found out it was the [[Varluk Organization]] and asked Rikarda to set [[Rescue of Lando Calrissian's puffer pig|course]] to their [[Varluk Organization headquarters|headquarters]] which was located on [[Zyzar]].<ref name="Puffer Problems">{{SWRMCite|21|Puffer Problems}}</ref>

After arriving, Calrissian tried to enter the headquarters through a window but was seen by to patrol men. Calrissian paralyzed and shot the patrol men and changed into one their uniforms. After entering the complex, he discovered all the rooms were empty but eventually found his pig in a cage. When trying to free her, he was captured by more patrol men and was sent to the companies leader, [[Ango Croom]].<ref name="Puffer Problems" />

[[File:Rescue of Landos puffer pig.png|thumb|245x245px|left|Lando rescuing his puffer pig]]
Croom explained to Calrissian that he was tired of waiting for him to return his debt, and decided to do it for him, by stealing his pig. Later Calrissian began to pull his pig out of the hands of the patrol men and the pig increased size, throwing the patrol men to the ground. As he was escaping, Calrissian threw a [[hologram]] of a location of raw materials in a room so the Varluk Organization could find it so Calrissian could pay his debt to the Varluk Organization. Later beyond the complex, Rikarda picked him up on the ''Stellar Sun'' and they escaped.<ref name="Puffer Problems" />

====Returning a favor====
Calrissian later came into contact with the rebels again some time later. After the rebels [[Action at Mustafar|destroyed]] the ''[[Sovereign]]'', the personal [[Star Destroyer]] of [[Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]], the Imperials tightened security on Lothal. The rebels [[Mission to Lothal (4 BBY)|returned]] to Lothal after having been away from the planet, where they were pursued by numerous Imperial agents: including [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]]. Vader ordered that no ship could leave Lothal, leading the rebels to contact Calrissian to ask for his assistance in smuggling them off-planet. He spoke to them via hologram, as he was not on Lothal, but nonetheless agreed to help them in exchange for three [[49-v99 Deflector|military-grade]] [[Deflector shield generator|shield generators]]. With the deal having been made, Calrissian ordered his personal droid, W1-LE, to assist the rebels with the [[masking transponder]]s that would trick the Empire into pursuing false signals from their stolen Imperial [[shuttle]]. The rebels successfully escaped Lothal.<ref name="The Siege of Lothal">''[[Star Wars Rebels: The Siege of Lothal]]''</ref>

====Trouble on Tyegin====
[[File:Lando aboard the Exas Jewell.JPG|thumb|right|244x244px|Lando aboard the ''Exas Jewell''.]]
Eventually, Calrissian returned to [[gambling]] at high stakes. At one point Calrissian traveled to the planet [[Tyegin]] and played a game of sabacc with local rich individuals aboard the ''[[Exas Jewell]]'', a [[luxury train]]. Calrissian managed to win, but when he cleared his winnings, the train was attacked by [[Pirate|raiders]]. They stole all of Calrissian's [[Currency|money]] and set the [[train]] on [[fire]] before disappearing on their rockets. Calrissian and the other players tried to stop the train: first they unhooked [[speeder]]s, and began to throw objects onto the [[railroad]]. Sometime later Calrissian and the other players were saved by [[Tyegin's law enforcement]].<ref name="Off the Rails">{{SWRMCite||Off the Rails}}</ref>

====Working with Sana Starros====
[[File:Lando and Sana.JPG|thumb|left|230x230px|Lando meeting with Sana Starros]]
[[Sana Starros]] and Calrissian traveled to [[Coruscant]] to help Starros to crank a scam with thirteen crates of Imperial weapons. Calrissian arranged for them to meet with an Imperial officer, where Sana told them that [[Krawg]] [[Krawg pirates|pirates]] had the crates. For more information, she took 20,000 credits, in addition to 5,000 that she received from the pirates for selling them one box.<ref name="Star Wars 34">''[[Star Wars 34: The Thirteen Crates]]''</ref>

After leaving Coruscant, they went to the planet [[Tatooine]], to the [[Jabba's Palace|palace]] of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the [[Hutt]]. There, Starros disowned from the common past with Calrissian and also reported for 20 thousand credits, who had the thirteenth box of weapons. She herself had stolen it from Jabba, but she stated that the Krawg had done it and successfully completion of their transaction.<ref name="Star Wars 34" />

When leaving Tatooine, the smugglers were attacked by a ship of Krawg who found out that she had deceived them. Eventually the Empire arrested the pirates and Calrissian and Starros managed to escape. They later traveled to [[Nar Shaddaa]] where they had dinner before Calrissian left.<ref name="Star Wars 34" />

===Galactic Civil War===
====Deal of a lifetime====
[[File:Orbital shipyard cc-24.jpg|right|245x245px|thumb|Lando lead an audacious heist to steal the Emperor's yacht ''Imperialis'']]
Prior to becoming the [[administrator]] of [[Cloud City]], Calrissian was a self-described opportunist trying to "make his way" through an uncaring [[universe]]. Calrissian was able to make a living by illegally acquiring and redistributing rare or valuable goods. However, due to Calrissian's penchant for gambling, he and his business partner [[Lobot]] were in deep with the wrong people. After convincing [[Moff]] [[Ssaria]], also known as the "fiend of [[Castell]]", into parting with a valuable and expensive trinket, Calrissian rendezvoused with Lobot at a [[cantina]]. After having had a few drinks, Calrissian was informed that Papa [[Toren]], the individual who had loaned him money, was ready to see him. Calrissian sought to square away his debt by handing over the trinket to Toren, but the loan shark rejected to honor their prior arrangement. Instead of clearing the smuggler's debt, Toren offered to lower Calrissian's debt by ten percent.<ref name="Lando 1">''[[Lando, Part I]]''</ref>

Outraged by the offer, Calrissian claimed this was not the deal they had agreed upon. Toren argued that if Calrissian had any qualms about the deal, he should take it up with the Imperials, who had taken his property from him in the first place. Toren argued that had Calrissian used the time he had been given to pay off the debt, Calrissian would not be in his current predicament of owing a vast sum of credits, with little-to-no time to pay it off. The loan shark suggested that if the smuggler was sincere and adamant about clearing his debt, he would do so, provided Calrissian agreed to do a job for him. After leaving the cantina, Calrissian and Lobot got into a heated exchange. Angry at the fact that Calrissian had accepted the deal, as well as Toren's gall, Lobot argued that Calrissian should have stood up to Toren. Calrissian countered by explaining that only people with no imagination use [[blaster]]s. If they tried to harm Toren, a [[bounty]] would be placed on their heads, adding to their current troubles.<ref name="Lando 1" />

Instead of using violence to accept the deal, Calrissian insisted that the job would be quick. It would not only clear their debt but would also put them ahead. Although Lobot was concerned about their chosen dangerous lifestyle, Calrissian promised his friend that they would no longer accept high stakes work after completing the job. Having acquired the services of [[Aleksin]] and [[Pavol]], in case the plan required the use of force, Calrissian and Lobot went to speak to [[Sava]] [[Korin Pers]], a former [[antiques dealer]] and [[professor]]. Calrissian attempted to make good on a promise to Korin, to pay her back for the loss of the woman's eye. Korin argued that she could not think of a reason why she would ever work with Calrissian again, until she saw Toren's plan and what they were going to steal. According to the plan, Calrissian and company were to steal a pleasure craft being refitted at [[Sienar Fleet Systems]] [[Orbital Shipyard CC-24]].<ref name="Lando 1" />

Adhering to Toren's plan, Calrissian and his crew donned [[stealth suit]]s and [[Theft of the Imperialis|infiltrated]] the [[shipyard]]. They managed to overpower the [[stormtrooper]] sentries and escape in the stolen ship. After taking off, Calrissian and Lobot discussed the fact that the ship that they had stolen seemed to be fairly advanced, specially modified. Lobot asked whether his friend could activate the [[hyperdrive]]. Calrissian, however, assured Lobot that he could do so only after the ship escaped the planet's gravity well. Unknown to Calrissian and his crew, they had stolen the [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine's]] personal luxury [[yacht]], ''[[Imperialis]]''.<ref name="Lando 1" />

====Imperial entanglements====
[[File:Lando and Lobot escape Castell.png|left|274x274px|thumb|Lando and Lobot aboard the ''Imperialis'']]
Before they could jump into hyperspace, Calrissian and Lobot found their path blocked by three [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|Imperial Star Destroyers]]. Calrissian was surprised that the Empire would dispatch such resources and realized that the ship was worth a lot. After the Imperial [[commander]] [[Commodore]] [[Idel]] destroyed Shipyard CC-24 for failing to respect the Emperor's property, he deployed a pair of [[gravity mine]]s to disable the yacht. However, the ''Imperialis''{{'s}} advanced automated defenses incinerated the bombs. An amazed Calrissian then instructed Lobot to power up the hyperdrive.<ref name="Lando 2">''[[Lando, Part II]]''</ref>

Korin then confronted Calrissian and asked what he had gotten them into. Based on the fact that the Imperials had deployed gravity [[mine]]s, Calrissian deduced that the Empire wanted to capture them because there was something irreplaceable and priceless aboard the ship. When two of the Star Destroyers trapped the ''Imperialis'' in their tractor beams, Calrissian devised a trick escape maneuver. He got Lobot to feed the coordinates of the tractor beams into his piloting [[computer]]. Lobot and Aleksin were skeptical about Calrissian's plan to fly into the beams but Korin convinced the others to trust him. Flying the ''Imperialis'', Calrissian locked [[Captain]] [[Conro]]'s [[Conro's Star Destroyer|Star Destroyer's]] tractor beam onto Captain [[Shan]]'s [[Shan's Star Destroyer|ship]]. This collision damaged the two Star Destroyers, allowing Calrissian and his crew to flee into deep space.<ref name="Lando 2" />

After escaping the Star Destroyers, Lobot thanked Calrissian for his dangerous maneuver. Calrissian then proposed to Korin that they divide the ''Imperialis''{{'s}} treasures among themselves and give the ship to Toren. When Calrissian asked Korin what they stole, she replied that the ship was full of treasure. After touring the ship's hallways, they reached the ''Imperialis''{{'s}} central chamber. Lobot managed to access the chamber with his [[AJ^6 cyborg construct|cybernetic headset]] but was impaled in the gut by a pair of [[Emperor's Royal Guard|Imperial Royal Guards]].<ref name="Lando 2" />

As Lobot succumbed to his injuries, his [[Cybernetics|implants]] began to take over his mind. With Korin's help, Calrissian brought the wounded Lobot to the ship's [[medical bay]] while Aleksin and Pavol fought the Royal Guards with [[Knife|knives]].<ref name="Lando 3">''[[Lando, Part III]]''</ref> Meanwhile, the Emperor dispatched the [[bounty hunter]] [[Chanath Cha]] to recover his ship.<ref name="Lando 2" /> He supplied her with the modified [[Star Courier]] ''[[Scimitar]]'', which was capable of tracking the hyperspace signature of starships. While Lobot recuperated inside a [[bacta tank]], Korin told Calrissian that they had encountered Imperial Royal Guards. Based on the ship's opulent treasures and the Royal Guard's presence, Korin deduced that the stolen ship belonged to the Emperor himself.<ref name="Lando 3" />

Calrissian was unwilling to listen to Korin's admonition and told him they were going to help the [[twin]]s. Calrissian and Korin found an armory and helped themselves to some blasters. When they returned to the central chamber, they discovered that Aleksin and Pavol had killed the Royal Guards. While Calrissian complimented the twins, Korin discovered that the guards had mysteriously been corrupted by [[Dark side of the Force|something]] in the valuable chamber. Calrissian and his companions discovered that the central chamber stored several [[Sith artifact]]s including the ancient [[mask of Lord Momin]]. Not realizing the danger, Calrissian quipped that the treasures they found could make up for Korin's lost eye.<ref name="Lando 3" />

====Pall of the Sith====
[[File:Chanath Cha face.png|right|222x222px|thumb|Chanath Cha, a familiar face from Lando and Lobot's past]]
When Calrissian asked how much the treasures in the central chamber were worth, Korin recognized that these artifacts belonged to the ancient [[Sith Lord]] [[Momin]], a [[Sith]] [[sculptor]] whose works were believed to be lost. While Calrissian and Korin discussed their plans to sell the merchandise, Aleksin gazed into the Sith helmet. He grabbed a [[double-bladed lightsaber]] and [[Dismemberment|sliced off]] his twin Pavol's lower right arm. Taken by surprise, Calrissian and Korin managed to exit the central chamber and seal the door. However, Pavol was left inside with the corrupted Aleksin.<ref name="Lando 4">''[[Lando, Part IV]]''</ref>

Ignorant of the Sith and their history, Calrissian believed that Aleksin had double-crossed them. However, Korin speculated that Aleksin had been corrupted by the Sith artifacts, based on her research into Sith lore at the [[University of Bar'leth]]. She deduced that the Royal Guards had been corrupted by their proximity to the Sith objects in the central chamber. Calrissian complimented Korin for being a "fascinating" lady but dismissed the [[Jedi]] and Sith as superstition. All that he was concerned about was that one of his team members had gone nuts and chopped off the arm of his companion. Calrissian also wanted to get back into the chamber and help Pavol.<ref name="Lando 4" />

Korin replied that she was leaving the ship in an escape pod and marveled that Calrissian cared for others for a change. Unknown to Calrissian and his companions, Cha had infiltrated the ship. She was a former romantic interest of Lobot. When Calrissian objected to leaving Pavol behind, Korin warned him not to underestimate the powers of the Sith. Calrissian refused to leave his friend Lobot behind. Before the argument could escalate, the two heard over the intercom that the ''Imperialis''{{'s}} escape pods had been disabled.<ref name="Lando 4" />

Despite Calrissian's objections, Korin headed to the bridge to reactivate the escape pods. However, she was held at gunpoint by Cha, who had disabled the escape pods. Calrissian went to confront the intruder only to discover that it was Cha. After embracing, Cha chastised Calrissian for stealing the Emperor's yacht. She recounted that the Emperor had sent her to kill whoever took his ship. If she was unable to do that, he had instructed her to destroy the ship. Cha warned Calrissian that the only cargo that the ''Imperialis'' carried was death.<ref name="Lando 4" />

====Escaping the ''Imperialis''====
[[File:Lobot Lando and Chanath.png|left|225x225px|thumb|Lando, Lobot, and Chanath aboard the ''Imperialis'']]
Recalling the Emperor's orders to kill the intruders or to destroy the ship, Cha opted to follow the second option since she was unwilling to hurt her former friend. Calrissian tried to reason with her but she pulled out her blaster and warned him that plans get people killed. Calrissian then tried to enlist Cha's help in dealing with Aleksin. He also suggested letting Korin and him escape in a few escape pods with some choice items while she destroyed the ship. Cha rejected that offer on the grounds that Palpatine would notice any choice items turning up on the [[black market]]. Unwilling to risk trouble with the Empire, Cha insisted on proceeding with her plan. However, she agree to ferry Calrissian and Korin to anywhere they wanted with her ship.<ref name="Lando 5">''[[Lando, Part V]]''</ref>

Calrissian then mentioned that he could not risk bringing his friend Lobot out of the [[bacta]] tank to avoid the danger of the implants taking over his mind. He reminded Cha that she once had a relationship with Lobot. Cha reluctantly agreed to help. However, they were then cornered by the corrupted Aleksin and Pavol, who were under the influence of Sith objects. Aleksin demanded that they leave "his" ship or he would kill them. Calrissian objected on the grounds that the heist had been his idea. Aleksin then appealed to Korin and offered to share their treasures with her. Korin stared into the Sith helmet and was corrupted. She volunteered to join forces with Aleksin and Pavol. However, Aleksin killed her with his double-bladed [[lightsaber]].<ref name="Lando 5" />

Cha manged to shoot the door panel shut and initiate the [[Self-destruct mechanism|self-destruct countdown]]. She then instructed Calrissian to retrieve Lobot from the medical bay while she docked her ship. Calrissian managed to helped Lobot out of the bacta tank. Before they could head to the [[airlock]], they were cornered by a lightsaber-wielding Aleksin. Using his smooth talk, Calrissian managed to trick Aleksin into deactivating his lightsaber before shooting him dead. They then joined Cha at the airlock. Despite killing Pavol, the three encountered a new predicament. The ''Scimitar''{{'s}} droid steward [[O-66]] had abandoned Cha after learning that she had activated the ''Imperialis''{{'s}} self-destruct mechanism.<ref name="Lando 5" />

When all seemed lost, Lobot volunteered to connect his [[cyborg]] unit to an interface. Despite struggling in his fight against the implants, Lobot managed to override the control codes. Calrissian and Lobot left in one escape pod while Cha left in the other. After escaping the ''Imperialis'', Calrissian listened as Lobot advised Calrissian to use his charm and skills to find something bigger to believe in other than himself. He also counselled Calrissian to use his talents for good.<ref name="Lando 5" />

====Business success====
{{Quote|A mining colony?''"<br />"''Yeah, a tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it.|Leia Organa and Han Solo|Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}
Some time later, Calrissian scored a major victory in a card game and won control of Cloud [[City]],<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" /> a [[tibanna]] [[gas]] mining operation within the [[atmosphere]] of the planet [[Bespin]].<ref name="Databank" /> The "legitimate pilot and businessman" [[Gev Hessan]] smuggled goods to Calrissian to help him build the city.<ref name="Aftermath" /> Calrissian became the [[Baron Administrator]] of Cloud City and turned to more reputable enterprises. As leader of the mining operation, he was able to keep the operation small enough to avoid being noticed by the Empire and the [[Mining Guild]], which he considered advantageous as his customers did not want to attract attention.<ref name="Episode V" />

====Deal with the Empire====
{{Quote|This deal's getting worse all the time.|Lando Calrissian|Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}
In [[3 ABY]],<ref name="Galactic Atlas">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]''</ref> [[Darth]] Vader and the [[Imperial Navy]] tracked Solo and the ''Millennium Falcon'' after they escaped from the [[Battle of Hoth]]. Vader intended to use Solo&mdash;as well as fellow [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] members [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Organa]] and Chewbacca, who were also aboard the ''Millennium Falcon''&mdash;to lure Vader's son, [[Luke Skywalker]], into a trap. Vader knew that if Skywalker thought his friends were in trouble, he would attempt to rescue them and fall into Vader's trap. In an effort to hide from the Empire, Solo suggested that they make their way to Cloud City and seek help from Calrissian. While en route to Bespin, the ''Falcon'' was tracked by bounty hunter [[Boba Fett]], who had been employed by Vader to find the ''Falcon''.<ref name="Episode V" /> Vader and Fett arrived on Cloud City before the ''Falcon'', and the Dark Lord of the Sith told Calrissian to help trap the Rebels or Cloud City would face the wrath of the Empire. Calrissian agreed to Vader's demands and awaited the Rebels' arrival.<ref name="Databank" />

[[File:Lando13.jpg|thumb|251x251px|right|Calrissian arrives to greet Solo.]]
The ''Millennium Falcon'' arrived at Cloud City and was granted permission from the city authorities to land. Once it landed, Calrissian personally greeted Solo and the others on the [[Platform 327|landing platform]] with Lobot and a full complement of the [[Bespin Wing Guard]] in tow. When Calrissian first approached, he feigned anger for actions Solo committed in their previous encounters. He quickly dropped the facade, however, and greeted his old friend with affection, telling Solo it was very good to see him again. Calrissian asked what brought Solo to Cloud City and the smuggler told him that they needed to repair the ''Falcon''. Calrissian briefly referred to it as his own ship, asking what Solo did to damage it, but Solo reminded him that he won it from Calrissian fair and square. Calrissian then noticed Organa and introduced himself, using his charms to personally welcome her to Cloud City.<ref name="Episode V" />

While the Rebels settled into an apartment on Cloud City, Calrissian ordered his workers to begin fixing the hyperdrive on the ''Millennium Falcon''. At some point, the work was completed and Calrissian was informed that the vessel was fixed, but the Empire secretly disabled the vessel's hyperdrive without Calrissian's knowledge. Once the Empire was ready to capture Solo, Organa, and Chewbacca, Calrissian greeted them in the apartment, where he admired Organa for her beauty. He also found that their [[protocol droid]], [[C-3PO]], had been mysteriously damaged and blown into several pieces, which piqued the suspicions of the Rebels. Nonetheless, after he asked them to join him for refreshments, they followed Calrissian throughout the facility, where he told them about the mining operations and how the Empire and the Mining Guild had no presence on Cloud City. Upon arrival at a dining room, Calrissian told them that he had made a deal to keep the Empire off of Cloud City, and he opened the door to reveal Vader and Fett; Fett intended to take Solo to Jabba to claim a bounty on the smuggler's head. As a result, the Rebels were successfully captured by the Empire.<ref name="Episode V" />

[[File:BobaVaderLando.jpg|thumb|241x241px|left|Calrissian grows increasingly concerned about his deal with the Dark Lord.]]
The Rebels were taken into custody, and Solo was [[torture]]d by the Empire; the torture was seen by Skywalker in a [[Force vision|vision]], who rushed to Cloud City to save his friends. Calrissian waited outside of the torture chamber where he heard Solo's screams, and spoke with the Dark Lord once Vader emerged from the chamber. Vader told him that Organa and Chewbacca could never leave Cloud City, to which Calrissian protested, as neither that nor helping Fett were part of their arrangement. Vader threatened to leave an [[Imperial Garrison (Cloud City)|Imperial garrison]] on Cloud City if Calrissian did not cooperate, which made Calrissian realize that the deal was getting worse and that Vader would not uphold his promises. After Solo's torture ended, Calrissian spoke to his old friend, Organa, and Chewbacca, and told them that the princess and Chewbacca would have to remain on Cloud City. He also told them that Vader was not interested in them, but rather he was using them to bait Skywalker to Cloud City, for which he received a slug to the face from an enraged Solo.<ref name="Episode V" />

Later, Vader determined that he would use the Cloud City [[carbon-freezing]] [[Carbon-freeze chamber|chamber]] to freeze Skywalker in [[carbonite]] so he could be delivered to the Emperor. To ensure that Skywalker would not be damaged, Vader decided to test the carbon-freezing on Solo. Calrissian protested, believing that the carbon-freezing would kill Solo. Nonetheless, Vader moved forward with the test. When Solo and the other Rebels arrived, Calrissian informed Solo of what was about to happen to him. Calrissian monitored the freezing and, when it was completed, checked on Solo's lifesigns, where he found that Solo was alive and in perfect carbonite hibernation. Vader then ordered Calrissian to bring Organa and Chewbacca to the Dark Lord's vessel, once again altering the deal he had made with the Baron Administrator.<ref name="Episode V" />

[[Imperial Military|Imperial forces]] led Calrissian and the Rebels towards the Dark Lord's ship. While en route, they encountered Skywalker, who exchanged fire with the Imperials before the stormtroopers led Calrissian and the Rebels away. The Imperials were soon [[Escape from Cloud City|surrounded]] by Cloud City security forces, led by Lobot, and disarmed. Calrissian freed the Rebels from their [[Stuncuffs|restraints]], at which point Chewbacca attacked him, grabbing his neck and choking him for his betrayal. Struggling to stop the enraged [[Wookiee]] from crushing his windpipe, Calrissian gasped out that there was still time to save Solo from the bounty hunter, who was taking him to the [[East Platform]]. The Rebels let Calrissian go, and he followed them towards the platform. They arrived in time to watch Fett's ship, ''[[Slave I]]'', take off. Though they attempted to fire at it with blasters, it had no impact and the bounty hunter escaped with Solo.<ref name="Episode V" />

[[File:Lando covering fire.png|thumb|260x260px|right|Calrissian provides covering fire for the Rebels' escape.]]
Stormtroopers soon arrived on the platform, forcing Calrissian and the Rebels to fight through them and escape. They made their way to the ''Millennium Falcon'' and arrived at its landing platform, only to find a locked door. [[R2-D2]]&mdash;Skywalker's astromech droid, who had rendezvoused with the Rebels&mdash;attempted and failed to open the door. While the droid was working, Calrissian issued a city-wide broadcast warning his citizens of the Imperial presence and impending occupation of Cloud City. He advised everyone to leave Cloud City before more Imperial forces could arrive. Calrissian's announcement created a frenzy of activity, as numerous people fled throughout the city. Calrissian led the Rebels through the commotion towards another doorway, which R2-D2 was able to open while Calrissian and the Rebels fought off more stormtroopers. The group ran towards the ''Falcon'', where Calrissian provided cover fire as the others boarded the ship. Once aboard, the ''Falcon'' lifted off from the platform, pursued by TIE fighters.<ref name="Episode V" />

As the ''Falcon'' was escaping, Skywalker&mdash;who had been injured in and escaped from a lightsaber [[Duel on Cloud City|duel]] with Vader&mdash;communicated to Organa through [[the Force]], calling to her for help as he struggled to hang onto an [[antenna]] at the base of Cloud City. Organa asked Chewbacca, who piloted the ''Falcon'', to turn the ship around so they could save their friend. Calrissian protested because of the TIE fighters, but the Rebels went back anyway to rescue their friend. They found Skywalker hanging from the city and positioned the ship underneath him. Once in position, Calrissian opened a hatch and took a lift to the top of the ship, where Skywalker fell into and Calrissian caught him. With Skywalker on board, the ''Falcon'' took off again from Cloud City, and Calrissian left Skywalker in Organa's care.<ref name="Episode V" />

Calrissian took the pilot's seat in the ''Falcon'' and prepared the ship for a jump into hyperspace. When he attempted to make the jump, however, the hyperdrive failed, much to Calrissian's frustration as he was unaware that the Empire had sabotaged the ship. The ''[[Executor]]'', Vader's [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought|Super Star Destroyer]], approached the vessel, where Vader would once again attempt to capture Skywalker. R2-D2, who learned of the sabotage while communicating with Cloud City's computer, made the necessary repairs to the hyperdrive and the ship was able to jump into hyperspace, successfully escaping from the Empire.<ref name="Episode V" />

====Rescuing Han Solo====
{{Quote|Princess, we'll find Han. I promise.|Lando Calrissian, to Leia Organa|Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}
[[File:Galaxy1.png|thumb|245x245px|left|Calrissian pilots the ''Falcon'' past a protostar, seeking to find Solo.]]
The ''Millennium Falcon'' returned to the [[Alliance Fleet]],<ref name="Episode V" /> Calrissian did not stay long, however, as he and Chewbacca intended to set out in the ''Millennium Falcon'' to find Solo. Before leaving the [[fleet]], he contacted Organa and Skywalker, promising the princess that he and Chewbacca would find Solo. The group agreed to meet at a rendezvous point on Tatooine, the location of Jabba's Palace. They said their goodbyes and the ''Falcon'' departed from the fleet, blasting off past a [[protostar]].<ref name="Episode V" />

Some time later, Calrissian and Chewbacca had located Solo's still-frozen body at Jabba's palace on Tatooine. Skywalker put together a plan in which Calrissian, Organa, Chewbacca, the droids, and Skywalker himself would rescue their friend and, if necessary, destroy Jabba the Hutt. Calrissian [[Rescue of Han Solo|infiltrated]] the palace and disguised himself as one of the Hutt's guards. He watched as each member of the Rebel team arrived; the droids arrived first, posing as gifts from Skywalker to Jabba, followed by Organa who posed as a [[Boushh|bounty hunter]] collecting the bounty on Chewbacca, who she brought as her prisoner. Organa later released Solo from carbon-freeze, but they were discovered by Jabba and his court. Solo was placed into a [[prison]] cell with Chewbacca, while Organa became the Hutt's [[Slavery|slave]]. Calrissian remained in disguise throughout the arrivals.<ref name="Episode VI" />

Skywalker arrived last and, while declaring himself a [[Jedi Knight]], demanded that Solo and the others be released to him. Jabba refused, and Skywalker was forced to fight and kill [[Pateesa|Jabba's]] [[rancor]] beast. When the rancor failed to kill Skywalker, Jabba sentenced Skywalker, Solo, and Chewbacca to be killed; the sentence was that they would be fed to the [[sarlacc]] creature in the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]], where they would be slowly digested over the course of a [[millennium]]. Calrissian, still disguised as a guard, traveled with Jabba and his entourage to the Great Pit of Carkoon, and was stationed aboard the [[Bantha-II cargo skiff|skiff]] on which the prisoners were kept.<ref name="Episode VI" />

[[File:Han rescues Lando.png|thumb|241x241px|right|Solo rescues Calrissian from the sarlacc.]]
Before the Rebels could be executed, R2-D2 revealed he had been concealing [[Luke Skywalker's green lightsaber|Skywalker's lightsaber]]. The Jedi Knight attacked Jabba's guards and Calrissian revealed himself, helping to free the prisoners and fight off the other guards. While doing so, he was knocked from the side of the skiff and fell towards the sarlacc, clinging onto the edge of the pit. Solo, who was partially though temporarily blind as a result of the carbon freezing, was lowered towards Calrissian by Chewbacca. Solo handed him a staff and Calrissian reached for it, but one of the sarlacc's tentacles grabbed his leg. Solo aimed a blaster at the tentacle and, despite Calrissian's concerns over Solo's ability to see his target, fired upon the creature. He hit the tentacle and the sarlacc released Calrissian, allowing Solo to pull him to safety.<ref name="Episode VI" />

Once they were aboard, Skywalker and Organa&mdash;who had killed Jabba aboard the Hutt's [[Khetanna|vessel]]&mdash;jumped from Jabba's ship to the skiff. Calrissian piloted the skiff away from Jabba's vessel as it exploded, and the group rescued the droids, who had fallen overboard earlier. With the rescue completed, the group returned to the ''Millennium Falcon'' and left Tatooine.<ref name="Episode VI" />

====Battle of Endor====
{{Quote|General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack.''"''<br />''"''Good luck. You're gonna need it.|Admiral Ackbar and Han Solo|Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi}}
[[File:General Lando.png|thumb|270x270px|left|Newly appointed general, Lando Calrissian jokes with Han Solo before a rebel briefing aboard Home One.]]
Calrissian participated in the [[Battle of Taanab]],<ref name="Episode VI" /> helping defeat a pirate fleet.<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" /> He then rendezvoused with the fleet to find that a battle was being prepared to strike a decisive blow against the Empire. The Empire was building a [[Death Star II|second Death Star]], which [[orbit]]ed the [[forest]] [[moon]] of [[Endor]], and the Emperor had personally arrived on the [[Space station|station]] to oversee the final stages of construction. Unknown to the Rebels was that the Emperor had allowed them to learn this information, as he was luring them into a trap in an attempt to destroy them. They believed that the station, which was fully operational, did not yet have use of its primary, [[Superweapon|planet-destroying weapon]]. As such, they put together a plan to destroy the Death Star and kill the Emperor. The plan would require a ground assault to destroy the [[Death Star's shield generator|generator]] that powered the shield protecting the Death Star, as well as a [[Navy|naval]] assault against the station itself. Calrissian volunteered to lead the [[starfighter]] attack and was commissioned as a [[general]] of the Rebel Alliance. He attended a Rebel briefing where the plan for the [[Battle of Endor]] was reviewed, and learned that Solo would lead the ground assault, with a [[Endor strike team|team]] that included Organa, Chewbacca, and Skywalker. Solo congratulated Calrissian on his promotion, to which he responded it must have been because of a maneuver he pulled at [[Taanab]]. Solo told Calrissian he could fly the ''Millennium Falcon'' during the battle. Knowing how much the ship meant to his friend, Calrissian promised that he would return her without so much as a scratch.<ref name="Episode VI" />

Solo and his team departed prior to the fleet, in order to give themselves time to destroy the shield. The Rebel fleet, meanwhile, prepared to leave. Once it was ready, Calrissian and his co-pilot, a [[Sullustan]] named [[Nien Nunb]], flew the ''Falcon'' to the head of the fleet, where all fighter [[squadron]]s were accounted for. [[Admiral]] [[Gial Ackbar]], who led the Alliance fleet, gave Calrissian the order to depart for Endor. Once they arrived at Endor, Nunb told Calrissian that the ''Falcon''{{'s}} scanners had been jammed, leading Calrissian to realize that the Empire knew they were coming and that the attack was a trap. As the squadrons approached the Death Star, Calrissian ordered his [[Alliance Military|forces]] to break off the attack, as he knew that the shield was still operational.<ref name="Episode VI" />

[[File:Lando7.jpg|thumb|273x273px|right|Calrissian and his co-pilot, Nien Nunb, during the Battle of Endor.]]
A hidden Imperial fleet revealed itself, and Calrissian and his fighter squadrons were forced to contend with incoming TIE fighters. He led his fighters towards the Imperial fleet in order to draw enemy fire away from the Rebel [[cruiser]]s, and the ''Falcon'' shot a number of the TIE fighters down. He soon saw Imperial Star Destroyers positioned away from the main fighting and was unsure as to why they were hanging back. Calrissian soon found an answer once the Death Star, revealed as operational, fired its [[Superlaser|primary weapon]] and destroyed a [[Liberty|Rebel cruiser]] with a single shot. Ackbar ordered a retreat, but Calrissian convinced him to keep the fleet in place, as he had faith that Solo would complete his mission on the surface. When another [[Nautilian|Star Cruiser]] was atomized by the superweapon, Calrissian told Ackbar to move the rest of the cruisers and engage the Star Destroyers at point-blank range, reasoning that they stood a far better chance against them than the Death Star and that the destroyers would be caught in the blast if the superlaser dared to fire again.<ref name="Episode VI" />

On the surface, Solo and his team successfully completed their mission and destroyed the [[SLD-26 planetary shield generator|shield generator]]. With the Death Star vulnerable, Ackbar ordered Calrissian and his forces to begin their assault on the battle station. The ''Falcon'' and the fighter squadrons entered an opening on the space station and headed for the [[reactor]] core, all while pursued by TIE fighters. While piloting towards their target, the ''Falcon'' hit a bulkhead on the interior of the Death Star, knocking its [[sensor]] [[Rectenna|dish]] off; Calrissian, as a result, had broken his promise to return the ''Falcon'' to Solo "without a scratch". The Rebels reached the main reactor, where the ''Falcon'' fired the shot that started a chain reaction to destroy the station. Calrissian piloted the ship back through the same route that they entered, as a ball of fire followed close behind. Despite the minor damage, the ''Falcon'' escaped the Death Star just in time and flew back towards the Rebel fleet as the Death Star exploded behind it.<ref name="Episode VI" />

[[File:Celebration on Endor.png|thumb|250x250px|left|Calrissian and his friends celebrate their victory on Endor.]]
Calrissian and his fellow Rebels made their way to the surface of Endor and regrouped in [[Bright Tree Village]], the home of the [[Ewok]]s who helped Solo and his team destroy the shield generator, where they all celebrated the destruction of the Death Star and the death of the Emperor; during the battle, Skywalker redeemed Vader, who in turn killed the Emperor before succumbing to his own injuries. Calrissian reunited with Solo, Chewbacca, and the rest of his friends for the festivities.<ref name="Episode VI" />

===Serving the New Republic===
====Operation: Cinder====
{{Quote|We just got word that Operation: Cinder is headed to Naboo.|[[General]] Lando Calrissian to [[Commander]] [[Iden Versio]] and [[Del Meeko]]|Star Wars Battlefront II}}
Though they had won the Battle of Endor, the Rebels would still face many challenges as they sought to restore the [[Galactic Republic]]. Shortly after [[Inferno Squad]]'s surrender, Calrissian discussed matters with the squad leader [[Iden Versio]]. He offered to let them leave free on two X-Wing fighters as well as providing them the option of helping stop the Empire from implementing [[Operation: Cinder]]. Iden and [[Del Meeko]] took the second option, leading Lando to assign them to join his friend [[Shriv Suurgav]] in [[Danger Squadron]].<ref name="Battlefront II" />

Calrissian commanded an Alliance Fleet including the [[MC80 star cruiser|cruiser]] ''[[Restoration]]'', the ''[[Mellcrawler II]]'' and a small fleet of starfighters, including Danger Squadron and defected members of [[Inferno Squad]] during the [[Battle of Naboo (Galactic Civil War)|battle of Naboo]], aiding [[Monarch of Naboo|Queen]] [[Sosha Soruna]], Organa and [[Lieutenant]] [[Shara Bey]] as they disrupted the Imperial operation to render [[Naboo]] inhospitable.<ref name="Shattered Empire III">''[[Shattered Empire, Part III]]''</ref><ref name="Battlefront II" />

The rebels then reengaged the Imperial forces and destroyed the last [[satellite]]s and engaged the ''Torment'', however, before going down, the ship deployed its [[Imperial Army|ground invasion force]] in an attempt to capture Theed and salvage the battle, after the ground battle ended, the [[New Republic]] began to form.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

====Liberation of Bespin====
{{Quote|Lobot, we're home. Guess the Empire didn't keep up with housekeeping.|Lando Calrissian, remained good-humored in the midst of hardship and conflict|Aftermath: Empire's End}}
Following the events at Endor, [[Governor]] [[Ubrik Adelhard]] imposed the [[Iron Blockade]] on the [[Anoat sector]]. Adelhard also claimed that the Empire had won the Battle of Endor and that rumors of the Emperor's death were rebel [[propaganda]]. In response, a resistance movement known as the [[Uprising]] emerged in the sector. Calrissian kept in touch with his old friend Lobot, who relayed messages through the blockade and served as a liaison between Calrissian and members of the Uprising. Unable to intervene directly in the uprising on Cloud City, Calrissian instead transferred credits to the rebels through the auspices of Lobot. He was privy to a joint operation by Lobot and the pirate [[Kars Tal-Korla]] to breach [[Governor Adelhard's chamber|Adelhard's personal quarters]] and capture him.<ref name="Aftermath" /> Though Adelhard evaded capture, the Uprising managed to [[Liberation of Bespin|liberate]] Bespin as the [[Galactic Civil War]] drew to a close.<ref name="Uprising" />

Calrissian managed to starve [[Ubrik Adelhard's Imperial remnant|Adelhard's Imperial remnant]] into submission. Around the time of the [[Battle of Jakku]], he returned to Cloud City at the head of a ragtag force of Wing Guards and [[New Republic soldier]]s. With Lobot at his side, Calrissian led a mopping-up operation against an Imperial hold-out in the [[Casino Level]]'s [[Bolo Tanga room]]. As they made their way there, Lobot reminded Calrissian to get Organa and Solo a nuptial gift for their [[Kylo Ren|expectant child]]. Calrissian joked about gifting the boy a little cape and mustache so that he could resemble Uncle Lando.<ref name="Empire's End">''[[Aftermath: Empire's End]]''</ref>

Upon arriving at the Bolo Tanga room, Calrissian met with the Wing Guard Captain [[Gladstone]], who informed him that the Imperials were holed up inside. While they had broken through to the beam outtake shaft, they were trapped by [[poison]]ous fumes. Calrissian then addressed the Imperials and offered to spare their lives if they surrendered. As a further incentive, he promised to give them a hot meal, a warm bed, and to send them away without fear of New Republic prosecution. After ending his address, Calrissian ordered his [[engineer]]s to unseal the door.<ref name="Empire's End" />

A dozen Imperials accepted Calrissian's offer and they were taken into custody by the Wing Guard. However, Gladstone then informed the Baron Administrator that an [[Unidentified Imperial sergeant|Imperial sergeant]] was refusing to surrender. Calrissian tried to reason with the [[sergeant]] but the man tried to shoot him. Calrissian was forced to kill the sergeant with his [[Vitiator]] blaster.<ref name="Empire's End" />

After subduing the Imperials, Calrissian chatted with Lobot about the matter of purchasing a nuptial gift. When Calrissian suggested a lamp and a blaster, Lobot opposed the ideas. Calrissian then proposed leaving his Vitiator in a save lock until Organa's son came of age. When Lobot vetoed that, Calrissian then proposed gifting the family a [[Vantillian catamaran]]. Lobot accepted that idea. When Calrissian toyed with the idea of starting his own family, Lobot vetoed that as well. Calrissian then invited Lobot out for a drink but Lobot responded that he did not drink. Calrissian then promised to find a win-win situation for both of them.<ref name="Empire's End" />

===Return to legitimate business===
{{Quote|Nothing is glamorous when you have a blaster pointed at your face.|Lando Calrissian|Tales from Wild Space: Family Affair, Part 1}}
Lando met up with [[Tonee]] to have a toast about his new honest life. He was approached by an old friend, [[Clariah]]. Lando was asked by Clariah to help find and teach her son [[Jiandy]], how to be a legitimate business man. As payment, Clariah offered to return one of Lando's beloved capes. However, Lando refused and wanted to run his business. However, Lando agreed to take Jiany under his wing. Lando took Jiandy to see [[Askroh]]. However, Jiandy and Lando were caught by Askroh and his men.<ref name="Family Affair 1">{{IDWAdventuresCite|10|[[Tales from Wild Space: Family Affair, Part 1]]}}</ref>

[[File:Lando and Clariah escaping Askroh.JPG|thumb|275x275px|right|Lando and Clariah escaping Askroh.]]
The two of them made their escape on a speeder. When their speeder gave out, Lando then spoke with [[Askroh]] about his returning his brooch. Askroh decided toss them over them, and realized that Jiandy had a secret compartment on his belt. He sold Jiandy out, but Calrissian was able to convince Askroh not to throw Jiandy over. As Jiandy ran, he told Calrissian that he never wants to see him again. Lando returned to the bar and was thanked by Clariah for setting her son on a better path.<ref name="Family Affair 2">{{IDWAdventuresCite|10|[[Tales from Wild Space: Family Affair, Part 2]]}}</ref>

===Rise of the First Order===
After the [[Galactic Concordance]] many Imperials then retreated to the [[Unknown Regions]] where they reestablished themselves as the [[First Order]].<ref name="Visual Dictionary">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> In [[28 ABY]],<ref name="Timeframe">{{Twitter|DelReyStarWars|status/652893780236988420|[[Del Rey]]|quote=So excited to have @claudiagray writing a #StarWars novel with us.

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|He's a card player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him.|Han Solo, to Leia Organa|audio=Han on Lando-ESB.ogg|Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}
Lando Calrissian was a [[human]] male with [[Color|black]] [[hair]], brown eyes, and dark skin. He often wore ornate [[clothing]] that included a cape.<ref name="Episode V" /> In his youth, Calrissian enjoyed playing sabacc,<ref name="Databank" /> and Solo described him as having been a scoundrel.<ref name="Episode V" /> Calrissian was also willing to undertaking dangerous risks. On one occasion, he, Lobot, and some companions stole the Emperor's luxury yacht ''Imperialis''.<ref name="Lando 1" /> Calrissian hoped to profit from selling the ship's treasures.<ref name="Lando 2" /> The heist undertook a dangerous turn when the Sith objects aboard corrupted his companions Aleksin, Pavol,<ref name="Lando 4" /> and Korin Pers.<ref name="Lando 5" /> Calrissian had little appreciation for the Sith and Jedi, regarding them as "con-jobs."<ref name="Lando 4" />

[[File:Landos Millennium Falcon Fathead.png|left|thumb|200x200px|The ''Millennium Falcon'' under Calrissian's ownership.]]
He was also familiar with the bounty Cha, which led her to spare his life.<ref name="Lando 4" /> Calrissian cared deeply for his friend Lobot and was unwilling to abandon him. The two were close friends. Lobot recognized Calrissian's charm and ability to motivate people and counseled him to find a greater cause than himself and to do good for others.<ref name="Lando 5" />

After losing the ''Millennium Falcon'' however, Calrissian sought to turn into a respectable businessman, and he turned Cloud City into a mostly-legitimate enterprise.<ref name="Databank" /> He was protective of his people to the point that he betrayed Solo and the Rebels to save Cloud City from the wrath of the Empire, for whom Calrissian had no love. He turned against the Empire, however, in order to give his citizens a chance to escape and to save Solo. Although Solo had felt betrayed by Calrissian's actions,<ref name="Episode V" /> the two reconciled after Solo was rescued from Tatooine, and shared a warm embrace during the victory celebration on Endor.<ref name="Episode VI" />

Calrissian was known for his jocular and witty personality. Despite the wartime damage to Cloud City, Calrissian was undaunted and preferred to look on the bright side of things by hiring [[refugee]]s to staff his facilities. Calrissian was also a smooth-talking negotiator who managed to convince several Imperial holdouts to surrender in return for being well-treated and allowed to leave Cloud City. Calrissian was also a man of honor who kept his promises. The only person that could exert an influence on Calrissian was his friend and employee Lobot. Calrissian welcomed the news that his friends Solo and Organa were expecting a child and looked forward to being an uncle.<ref name="Empire's End" />

==Skills and abilities==
[[File:X-8 Night Sniper EaW.png|right|thumb|200x200px|An X-8 Night Sniper was Calrissian's favored blaster.]]
{{Quote|Someone must've told them about my little maneuver at the Battle of Taanab.|Lando Calrissian|Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi}}
Calrissian was a skilled pilot. During the Battle of Taanab, Calrissian performed a piloting maneuver that impressed even himself. He later attributed that maneuver as being one of the reasons why the Rebel Alliance commissioned him as a general and placed him in a command position for the Battle of Endor.<ref name="Episode VI" /> Calrissian was also skilled with a blaster, wielding [[Lando's X-8 Night Sniper|an]] [[X-8 Night Sniper]] as his weapon of choice which he used against Azmorigan's thugs with enough proficiency to earn him a compliment from Wren, herself an accomplished markswoman.<ref name="Idiot's Array" />

Calrissian once undertook a dangerous maneuver which involved latching onto a Star Destroyer's tractor beam and causing it to collide with another Star Destroyer. Calrissian boasted of doing this maneuver a thousand times.<ref name="Lando 2" /> Calrissian was also a cunning combatant and once tricked the lightsaber-wielding Aleksin into deactivating his blade so that he could kill him.<ref name="Lando 5" /> Calrissian also owned a [[Rossmoyne]] Vitiator [[pistol]], which he won in a game of [[Six-Card Gizka Limit]] from a [[spice]]-drunk [[Aybarian]] [[Unidentified Aybarian diplomat|diplomat]]. Calrissian used this pistol to kill an Imperial sergeant who refused to surrender.<ref name="Empire's End" />

==Behind the scenes==
{{Quote|The audience was so enamored with Lando, they could forgive Lando for anything. If you're able to play a character that can be sort of a bad guy but has redeeming qualities, those are the best characters to play. That was a great challenge to me, to make him palatable, and it worked.|Billy Dee Williams, commenting on his work as Lando Calrissian|Among the Clouds}}
Lando Calrissian was portrayed by [[Billy Dee Williams]] in [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']] and [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']].<ref name="Episode V" /><ref name="Episode VI" /> Williams reprised the role in "[[Idiot's Array (episode)|Idiot's Array]]," the ninth episode of the [[Star Wars Rebels Season One|first season]] of the animated television series ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'',<ref name="Idiot's Array" /> and returned in the first episode of the [[Star Wars Rebels Season Two|second season]], "[[Star Wars Rebels: The Siege of Lothal|The Siege of Lothal]]".<ref name="The Siege of Lothal" /> Williams also reprised the role for the game ''[[Star Wars Battlefront II]]''.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

[[Lawrence Kasdan]], who co-wrote ''The Empire Strikes Back'', ''Return of the Jedi'' and ''[[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'', told ''Vanity Fair'' that Calrissian is not in ''The Force Awakens'', but added that he believes that there is a future for the character and that Calrissian is not "finished in any way, shape, or form."<ref name="Lando Future">{{Cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/05/lawrence-kasdan-star-wars-force-awakens|title=Lawrence Kasdan Says There's a Future for Lando Calrissian in Star Wars|work=Vanity Fair|date=May 18, 2015|accessdate=May 18, 2015}}</ref> [[Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi|''The Last Jedi'']] director [[Rian Johnson]] briefly considered to bring back Lando in the film as the [[codebreaker]] that [[Finn]] and [[Rose Tico]] needed to find at [[Canto Bight]], but Calrissian was ultimately written out from the film's script and replaced by [[DJ]] in the role.<ref>[https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/star-wars-last-jedi-cast-demand-jj-abrams-brings-back-lando-episode-9-exclusive-170003275.html 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' cast demand JJ Abrams brings back Lando for 'Episode 9' (exclusive)] at [https://uk.movies.yahoo.com Yahoo!

A young Lando Calrissian is portrayed by [[Donald Glover]] in the [[2018]] film ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]''.<ref name="Donald Glover">{{SW|url=news/donald-glover-cast-as-young-lando-calrissian-in-upcoming-han-solo-star-wars-stand-alone-film|text=Donald Glover Cast as Young Lando Calrissian in Upcoming Han Solo ''Star Wars'' Stand-Alone Film}}</ref> Since the production's beginning, Calrissian was always included in the script as he was necessary to the story.<ref name="Lando From Beginning">{{SW|url=news/solo-lawrence-and-jonathan-kasdan-interview|text=A Portrait Of The Scoundrel As A Young Man: Writers Lawrence And Jonathan Kasdan On ''Solo: A Star Wars Story''}}</ref> When asked about the character's depiction in the film, screenwriter [[Jon Kasdan]] confirmed that Lando is meant to be pansexual. "There's a fluidity to Donald and Billy Dee's [portrayal of Lando's] sexuality," he said. "I mean, I would have loved to have gotten a more explicitly LGBT character into this movie. I think it’s time, certainly, for that, and I love the fluidity ― sort of the spectrum of sexuality that Donald appeals to and that droids are a part of." Kasdan's father and co-writer was more ambiguous about his thoughts on the character's sexuality, saying "Maybe [Lando's allegedly flirty attitude toward Han] means something, maybe it doesn’t.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/lando-calrissian-sexual-fluidity-solo-star-wars_us_5af77d59e4b00d7e4c1b37a9|title='Star Wars' Writer Confirms Lando's Sexual Fluidity In 'Solo'|work=The Huffington Post|date=2018-05-17|accessdate=2018-05-17}}</ref>
