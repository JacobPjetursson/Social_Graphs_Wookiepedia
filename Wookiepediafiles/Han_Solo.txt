{{Quote|Never tell me the odds!|Han Solo|Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}
'''Han Solo''', formerly known only as '''Han''' until being given the surname Solo by [[chief]] [[Imperial Recruitment Officer|recruitment officer]] [[Drawd Munbrin]], and also known as '''Cadet 124-329''' when serving as a [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] [[cadet]], was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] [[smuggler]] who became a leader in the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] and an instrumental figure in the defeat of the [[Galactic Empire]] during the [[Galactic Civil War]]. He hailed from [[Corellia]] and became a smuggler in the employ of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the [[Hutt]], even completing the [[Kessel Run]] in just twelve [[parsec]]s with his prized [[Starship|ship]], the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. He was the son-in-law of fallen [[Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Senator]] [[Padm√© Amidala]], husband of [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Organa]], brother-in-law of [[Jedi Master]] [[Luke Skywalker]], [[Parent|father]] of [[Kylo Ren|Ben Solo]], rivals and close friends with fellow smuggler [[Lando Calrissian]], and best friends with the [[Wookiee]] [[Chewbacca]], his trusted co-[[pilot]] who swore a [[life debt]] to the [[Corellian]] smuggler. Solo ran afoul of Jabba after ditching a shipment of [[spice]] to avoid trouble with the Empire, owing the Hutt a great deal of [[Credit|money]] as a result. His fortune seemed to have changed when he agreed to charter Luke Skywalker, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], and the [[droid]]s [[R2-D2]] and [[C-3PO]] to [[Alderaan]], but he became caught up in the rebellion against the Empire and, after helping Leia Organa [[Rescue of Princess Leia|escape]] from the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]], briefly fought in the [[Battle of Yavin]], which allowed Skywalker to destroy the [[superweapon]]. Solo fought with the Rebellion for a number of [[Standard year|years]] afterward, taking part in numerous operations and battles against the Empire.

After the [[Battle of Hoth]], Solo sought safe refuge with Organa&mdash;with whom he had fallen in love&mdash;Chewbacca, and C-3PO on [[Cloud City]], which was operated by his old friend Lando Calrissian. There, they were captured by the [[Sith Lord]] [[Darth]] Vader as part of a trap to bait Skywalker to the [[city]]. Solo was [[Carbon-freezing|frozen]] in [[carbonite]] and taken to [[Jabba's Palace]] on [[Tatooine]] by the [[bounty hunter]] [[Boba Fett]], where he remained encased in carbonite for [[Standard month|months]] until he was [[Rescue of Han Solo|rescued]] by his friends. After returning to the [[Alliance Fleet]], Solo was promoted to the [[Military rank|rank]] of [[general]] and was given command of the [[Pathfinders]], a [[special forces]] [[squad]], for the [[Battle of Endor]]. Solo led the Pathfinders to [[Endor]], where he, Organa, Chewbacca, and the special forces team, with the help of the native [[Ewok]]s, destroyed the [[Death Star's shield generator|shield generator]] protecting the [[Death Star II|second Death Star]] that was being constructed in [[orbit]]. Their actions allowed the Alliance [[Fleet]] to destroy the superweapon.

The Battle of Endor, which saw the [[death]]s of [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]] and Darth Vader, allowed the Rebellion to form the [[New Republic]]. In the early [[Standard day|days]] after Endor, Solo continued to lead the Pathfinders against the Empire. He [[Marriage|married]] Organa, and the two had a son, Ben Solo. The boy struggled with the [[dark side of the Force]]&mdash;like his mother, who was the daughter of Darth Vader and twin sister of Luke Skywalker, Ben was [[Force-sensitive]]&mdash;so Organa sent him to be [[Jedi training|trained]] as a [[Jedi]] by Skywalker. He was seduced to the dark side by [[Snoke]], [[Supreme Leader]] of the [[First Order]], resulting in the [[Destruction of Luke Skywalker's Jedi Temple|destruction]] of Skywalker's attempt to rebuild the [[Jedi Order]].

Having lost their son, Solo left and returned to smuggling, and even lost the ''Millennium Falcon'' to numerous thieves. He continued to smuggle until he was brought back into the fight by a [[scavenger]] named [[Rey]] and a [[Deserter|defected]] First Order [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtrooper]] named [[Finn]], who carried with them a droid, [[BB-8]], that had part of a [[Map to Skywalker|map]] to Skywalker's [[Ahch-To|location]]. Solo, who retrieved the ''Falcon'' from Rey and Finn, returned to Organa, who led the [[Resistance]] against the First Order, and fought in the [[Battle of Starkiller Base|battle]] to destroy the First Order superweapon known as [[Starkiller Base]]. During the battle, Solo saw his son, who had taken the name Kylo Ren, and tried to convince him to return home. Instead, Ren stabbed his father with [[Kylo Ren's lightsaber|his lightsaber]]. Mortally wounded, Solo fell to his death in the bowels of the Starkiller weapon.

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Quote|I came up running scams on the streets of Corellia.|Han Solo, to Tobias Beckett|Solo: A Star Wars Story}}
Han was born on the [[planet]] [[Corellia]] during the waning [[Standard year|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic]]<ref name="Ultimate">''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''</ref> around [[32 BBY]].<ref name="TOG" /> Sometime after he became famous, it would be rumored by an [[Snivvian]] [[bounty hunter]] that Han was actually a descendant of the [[Prince-Admiral]] [[Jonashe Solo]], a member of the ancient [[Corellian royalty]].<ref>''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: Tales from Vandor]]''</ref> During his formative years, [[Han Solo's father|his father]] worked in the [[Corellian Engineering Corporation]] [[shipyard]]s, building vessels such as [[YT-1300 light freighter]]s until he was laid off. Solo's father wished he could leave Corellia on such a ship, but was never able to afford to. According to Han, he was never close with his father.<ref name="Solo" /> At one point his father brought him to the freighter factory where he worked. His father pointed out that the ships being built there were his contributions to the galaxy, but that they really ultimately didn't matter. His father then advised him that Han wasn't meant to build ships, but rather to fly them.<ref name="Most Wanted">''[[Most Wanted]]''</ref> His father later abandoned him.<ref name="Solo Expanded Edition">''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: Expanded Edition]]''</ref>

====Working for the White Worms====
{{Quote|Next time somebody hits me, I hit them back!|Han Solo threatens Molloch|Solo: A Star Wars Story}}
Sometime after his father [[Death|died]],<ref name="Ultimate" /> Han became involved with the criminal gang, [[White Worms]] serving as a [[Scrumrat]]. Here, Han met with fellow Scrumrat [[Qi'ra]].<ref name="Solo" />

When Han was about the age of eighteen, Han and Qi'ra were vying for the position of [[Head (White Worms)|Head]] within the White Worms. During their respective assignments, Han and Qi'ra both failed to deliver as promised, leading them to be hunted down by factions such as the White Worms, the [[Kaldana Syndicate]], as well as the Empire. Han had acquired a [[Data cube|datacube]] with plans for a [[Deflector shield generator|shield generator]] that was desired by all the factions. Han and Qi'ra had no choice but to partner up to find a resolution to their problems. Eventually, Qi'ra became Head thanks to Han's recommendation to [[Lord|Lady]] [[Proxima]]. As they later ate together, Han asked if he and Qi'ra were on their first date. Qi'ra denied it, but acknowledged the possibility that it could happen someday.<ref name="Most Wanted" />
[[File:White Worms' Den Databank.jpeg|thumb|left|249x249px|Han and Qi'ra before they escape Lady Proxima.]]

Sometime later, Han and Qi'ra began a romantic relationship.<ref name="Solo" /> Intending to leave Corellia, Han made a deal with some individuals. They were later beating Han up because he had the deal but broke it and escaped with a<ref name="Solo 1">''[[Solo Adaptation 1]]''</ref> extremely valuable [[coaxium]], as well as a speeder. Han attempted to take Qi'ra with him, but both were captured by the White Worms, and brought before crime boss Lady Proxima. Han threw a rock through a window, allowing the sunlight to burn Proxima's skin.<ref name="Solo" />

In the confusion, Han and Qi'ra escaped to the [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] checkpoint, where they used the coaxium to bribe the officer on duty to let them through. Han was able to make it through, but at that
[[File:Han and Qi'ra escape Corellia.JPG|thumb|right|246x246px|Han and Qi'ra escaping the White Worms.]]
moment Qi'ra was spotted and the officer closed the doors. As Qi'ra was pulled away Han promised to come back to save her. Qi'ra was captured by the White Worms and Han began to try to find a way to save her. As he looked around the center, he spotted an Imperial recruitment center.<ref name="Solo" />

===Working for the Empire===
====Becoming "Han Solo"====
{{Quote|Good luck Han Solo. We'll have you flying in no time.|Drawd Munbrin to Han, shortly after giving him the name Solo|Solo: A Star Wars Story}}
[[File:Han geets his name.JPG|thumb|217x217px|left|Han gets his last name "Solo" from Drawd Munbrin.]]
Immediately after losing Qi'ra, Han entered the area and tried to enlist in the Imperial Navy. When asked what his last name was, Han responded that he did not have a people and was alone. Due to this he was assigned the name "Solo" by [[Imperial Recruitment Officer|recruitment officer]] [[Drawd Munbrin]]. His goal was to become a skilled pilot and eventually return to Corellia to find Qi'ra.<ref name="Solo 1" />

====Serving as an Imperial====
{{Quote|Tie fighters. Now we're talking--|Han Solo when he arrives at the Carida Academy|Han Solo - Imperial Cadet 1}}
[[File:Han arrives at Carida.JPG|thumb|right|274x274px|Han arrives at the Carida Academy.]]
When Han was recruited by Drawd Munbrin, he assigned Han to the [[Carida Academy|Imperial academy]] on the [[planet]] [[Carida]]. When Han arrived, [[droid]]s stripped his [[Clothing|clothes]] off until he was completely naked. Right after different droids gave heim his new [[Galactic Empire|imperial]] [[cadet]] suit and also gave Han a shave. After, Han joins a room filled with many other cadets. Here a [[Sexes|female]] [[imperial officer]] named [[Triosa Broog]] was speaking over them. Soon after he tried to greet a cadet but he said shut up to Han when he responded. Han then realized that when he said shut up, he used his Han's cadet name, and you are only know as numbers at the imperial academy. Later Han was practicing on a battle field as a [[swamp trooper]] and thought how this is suppose to help him in [[pilot]] training. Broog over heard Han. Han then raised his hand and Broog called him a [[Corellian]] [[worm]]. Broog ask what was his name. They had a short conversation about his name. Broog then said to many other cadets that teach Han how basic training is suppose to help flying.<ref name="Imperial Cadet 1">''[[Han Solo - Imperial Cadet 1]]''</ref>

[[File:Han's crash.JPG|thumb|left|267x267px|Stormtroopers surround Han after crashing the TIE fighter.]]
Immediately after, the cadets then started to beat Han up. While they were beating him up, one cadet named [[404-913]] started to insult Han. During this, a cadet named [[Kanina Nico|803-308]] told them to let him go. Han then says thanks for the help and asks for the name of the cadet but refuses to say. Right after two cadets named [[Lyttan Dree]] and [[Tamu Dree]] were having a conversation about why they joined the empire. They also said that why did you sign up for the empire to Han. Han responded, to get off Corellia. Lyttan and Tamu said right after that you will never even going to make it to learn how to fly at the academy and said that they might send you to a wretched place like [[Urthak]] or [[Mimban]]. Han was thinking about what they said and thought that he should do something deeply stupid. Han then sneaked into a [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighter]] hanger and stole a fighter. Han eventually crashed the TIE and [[stormtrooper]]s surround Han at the crash sight.<ref name="Imperial Cadet 1" />

At some point his skills at flying at the imperial academy became the only thing giving pause to his superiors from outright expelling him from the flight academy at Carida. Finally, during an attack by raiders on Onyx Squadron, Han disobeyed orders once more in order to save the life of Cadet [[Lyttan Dree]]. Solo was able to take out three raiders before crashing into a hangar. Unfortunately, Solo's crash destroyed the hangar and dozens of astromechs. This action led to him being [[court-martial]]ed and [[Tribunal of Han Solo|tried]] by Commodore [[Almudin]].<ref name="Solo 1" /> Solo was expelled from the academy.<ref name="Expanded Edition">''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: Expanded Edition]]''</ref> and forcibly drafted into the [[224th Imperial Armored Division]] as a [[Corporal]]<ref name="TOG" /> and deployed to an active combat zone on [[Mimban]].<ref name="Solo" />

===Alliance with Tobias Beckett===
{{Quote|If you come with me...you're in this life for good.|Tobias Beckett to Han Solo|Solo: A Star Wars Story}}
====The Mimban Campaign and Saving Chewbacca====
{{Quote|I saved him, at least that's what he says, the big fuzzy fool, but really, he saved me. I was on a bad path, and Chewie, he put me straight. Saved my shanks more than once too.|Han Solo on how Chewbacca saved him|Aftermath: Life Debt}}
[[File:Solo-db-han-beckett-mimban-gallery 1bb27b64.jpg|thumb|right|235x235px|Solo encountering Beckett and Val.]]
During the [[Mimban campaign]], Solo encountered [[Tobias Beckett]], [[Val]], and [[Rio Durant]], a gang of thieves who had disguised themselves as [[Imperial Army soldier]]s to pull a heist. Solo was initially beguiled, but soon discerned their true identities. He noticed Beckett and his crew had blaster burns in some parts of their uniforms. Solo threatened to expose them if they didn't take him with them, but Beckett instead reported Solo to his superiors for insubordination.<ref name="Solo" />

[[File:Hairy and the Boy.jpeg|thumb|217x217px|left|Solo faces Chewie in the dungeons of Mimban.]]
Solo's commanding officer decided to execute Solo by giving him to "the beast," in fact the [[Wookiee]] [[Chewbacca]], a prisoner of the
Empire. Solo used his knowledge of [[Shyriiwook]] to convince Chewbacca to stage a fight with them, allowing them to escape
[[Prison|imprisonment]]. They then managed to join a reluctant Beckett's crew.<ref name="Solo" /> Chewbacca, grateful for Solo's
intervention, proclaimed a [[life debt]] to the outlaw. Chewbacca thereby became Solo's lifelong friend.<ref name="Absolutely Everything">''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know]]''</ref>

====Vandor and Encounter with Crimson Dawn====
{{Quote|Captain Lando Calrissian.''"<br />"''Han Solo.|Lando Calrissian and Han Solo introducing themselves to each other|Solo: A Star Wars Story}}
[[File:Conveyex_Aurebesh.jpg|thumb|213x213px|right|Beckett's gang raids the Conveyex train.]]
Han Solo and Chewbacca began their outlaw lives working as part of pirate Tobias Beckett‚Äôs crew. The group were hired by [[Crimson Dawn]] to steal a train car of refined coaxium on [[Vandor]]. However, they failed due to the intervention of [[Enfys Nest]] and the [[Cloud-Riders]], and Solo's decision to drop the cargo. Solo and Chewbacca promised [[Dryden Vos]] of Crimson Dawn an equivalent shipment that they would obtain unrefined by making the notorious [[Kessel Run]]. Vos sent Qi'ra, who had become his top lieutenant, with them.<ref name="Solo" />

====Meeting Lando Calrissian and the Kessel Run====
{{Quote|I just did the Kessel Run in twelve parsecs.|Han Solo, to a Savareen inhabitant|Solo: A Star Wars Story}}
[[File:Han Lays Eyes on The Falcon.jpg|thumb|left|249x249px|Han lays eyes on the Falcon for the first time.]]
Knowing they would need a fast ship to transport the coaxium before it degraded and exploded, Qi'ra introduced the pair to the self-proclaimed galactic entrepreneur and gambler [[Lando Calrissian]]. Solo played Calrissian in a game of "[[Corellian Spike]]" [[sabacc]], with the stakes being Calrissian's YT-1300 light freighter, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. Solo lost the game due to Calrissian hiding cards up his sleeve. Regardless, Calrissian agreed to personally pilot the ''Falcon'' for the job in return for a cut of the profits.<ref name="Solo" />

Solo, Chewbacca, Qi‚Äôra, Calrissian, and Beckett stole the unrefined coaxium from [[Kessel]] during a slave riot instigated by Calrissian‚Äôs navigational droid, [[L3-37]]. During the escape, Solo flew the ''Falcon'', with Chewbacca as his copilot, for the first of many times. Because the crew stole the coaxium fuel as unrefined, it was necessary to make the escape from Kessel to the refinery on [[Savareen]] in record time, prompting Solo to plot a shorter, and much more dangerous course through the maelstrom that surrounded Kessel and near a gravity well called [[the Maw]], reducing the typical distance required from 20 to 12 parsecs.<ref name="Solo" />

====Savareen and Choosing Allegiances====
{{Quote|You were wrong about one thing, I was paying attention. You told Chewie people are predictable. You're no exception.|Han Solo to Tobias Beckett|Solo: A Star Wars Story}}
[[File:Dryden and Han.jpg|thumb|right|270x270px|Dryden accuces Han of giving him fake coaxium.]]
Upon reaching Savareen and refining the coaxium, the crew was confronted by Enfys Nest, who explained to them that the Cloud-Riders were not pirates but freedom fighters stirred to action by the atrocities committed by Crimson Dawn and other crime syndicates. Solo devised a plan to give the coaxium to the Cloud-Riders and give Vos fake coaxium, but Vos was prepared for their betrayal because of information given to him by his double agent in the crew, Beckett.<ref name="Solo" />

However, Solo had double-crossed Beckett and Vos: the containers he left with the Cloud-Riders were empty, and Nest dispatched the agents Vos sent to retrieve it. The coaxium Solo, Qi'ra, and Chewbacca brought to Vos was, in fact, genuine. Beckett managed to escape with the
[[File:Han watches Qi'ra leave.JPG|thumb|left|252x252px|Solo and Chewbacca watch Qi'ra leave Savareen.]]
Coaxium and Chewbacca as a hostage. Qi'ra betrayed and killed Vos, promising to follow Solo as he pursued Beckett. Solo found and killed Beckett, but could only watch as Qi'ra left him behind, leaving Savareen in Vos' [[First Light|yacht]] to meet Crimson Dawn leader [[Maul|Darth Maul]]. Solo entrusted the coaxium to Nest, who intended to use it to form a rebellion against the Empire.<ref name="Solo" />

===Captain of the ''Millennium Falcon''===
====Winning the ''Falcon''====
{{Quote|Fair and square, baby. Fair and square.|Han Solo|Solo: A Star Wars Story}}
[[File:Han and Chewie on Numidian Prime.JPG|thumb|280x280px|right|Han about to plays sabacc with Lando and wins the Millennium Falcon.]]
Solo and Chewbacca tracked down Calrissian to [[Numidian Prime]]. While greeting Lando with an overly exuberant facade, Solo swiped the spare cards Lando held up his sleeve. With Lando's magic charm in his possession, Solo confidently challenged him to a rematch of sabaac for the ''Falcon''. Using the stolen cards to his advantage, Solo won the rematch and gained possession of the Millennium Falcon, much to Lando's chagrin.<ref name="Solo" />
[[File:Winners of the Falcon.jpeg|thumb|left|247x247px|Han and Chewie in the cockpit of their newly acquired Millennium Falcon.]]
The ''Falcon'' instantly became Solo's most prized possession. With their newly acquired ship and confidence, Solo and Chewbacca began engaging in much more dangerous and risky criminal operations, eventually becoming smugglers.<ref name="Ultimate" /> Around the same time, Chewbacca hung Han's pair of [[chance cube]]s above the freighter's piloting console.<ref name="Smuggler's Run">''[[Smuggler's Run: A Han Solo & Chewbacca Adventure]]''</ref> At some point during their travels the two met with the individual [[Dash Rendar]].<ref name="TFV">''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: Tales from Vandor]]''</ref>

====Chewie's day off====
Solo piloted the ''Falcon'' through an asteroid field during a run to sell marked [[Sabacc]] decks to the [[Unidentified casino (Marquinn)|casino]] on [[Marquinn]]. He told Chewbacca to take the day off while he sold marked sabacc decks to the casino's owner [[Zefin Tuzo]]. During Chewbacca's day off, he countered a criminal named [[Vullen Candroon]] which wanted to [[Death|kill]] Chewbacca. Chewbacca escaped Candroon but ran into Zefin Tuzo, who was working with Vullen. Later Chewbacca managed to escape Candroon and Tuzo. Meanwhile Han was talking to patrons in the casino. Chewbacca immediately ran into the casino to get Han because he was getting chased by Candroon and Tuzo. They later Han and Chewbacca managed to escape aboard the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name="Chewie's Day Off">{{IDWAdventuresCite|14|[[Chewie's Day Off]]}}</ref>

[[File:Kallus & Solo.jpg|thumb|279x279px|right|Solo confronted by ISB Agent Kallus.]]
At some point after winning the Millenium Falcon, [[Imperial Security Bureau]] agent [[Alexsandr Kallus]] hired the bounty hunter [[IG-88]] to assist in tracking down Solo, with the intention of bringing the smuggler to justice for defecting from the Empire and assisting Enfys Nest. Solo and Chewbacca fled the two, and escaped capture by flying the Falcon between two Imperial Star Destroyers.<ref name="Flight of the Falcon 1">{{IDWAdventuresCite|14|[[Flight of the Falcon, Part 1: Spy Games]]}}</ref>

====The Cordaxian Sea====
{{Quote|Kill you...kill you both for this...|Frax to Han Solo|Star Wars Annual 3}}
[[File:Frax points gun at Han.JPG|thumb|left|222x222px|Frax points his gun at Han solo.]]
Some time after escaping [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] agent [[Alexsandr Kallus|Kallus]],<ref name="Flight of the Falcon 1" /> Han Solo and Chewbacca were transporting two tons of [[Cordaxian ore]] on the [[planet]] [[Odona]], with the help of [[Frax]], a [[Kajain'sa'Nikto]]. They were pursued by the Empire, and Frax, who was worried about being put in an Imperial [[prison]] but then he pulled a blaster on Han. Chewbacca did a barrel roll with the ''Millenium Falcon'', knocking Frax off the ship into the [[Cordaxian sea]]. Han and Chewbacca escaped the empire and Odona, but they left Frax behind.<ref name="Annual 3">''[[Star Wars Annual 3]]''</ref>

====Stenness====
{{Quote|It was one of my stupid schemes. To get back at a crime lord who'd been double-crossing spice smugglers.|Han Solo|Star Wars 11: Showdown on the Smuggler's Moon, Part IV}}
Eventually, Solo would make his way to the planet [[Stenness]] where he devised a plot to get revenge against a [[Unidentified crime lord (Stenness)|crime lord]] who operated a [[Unidentified gambling den|gambling den]],<ref name="Star Wars 11">''[[Star Wars 11: Showdown on the Smuggler's Moon, Part IV]]''</ref> and had continuously double-crossed spice smugglers.<ref name="Star Wars 12">''[[Star Wars 12: Showdown on the Smuggler's Moon, Part V]]''</ref> In order for the escapade to look as legitimate as possible, Solo and his fellow scoundrels arranged a fraudulent [[marriage]] ceremony where Solo and the woman [[Sana Starros]] were illegitimately married. The robbery occurred, too, and Solo was given his share. However, Solo also took Starros's share and fled, leaving Starros in a dire situation.<ref name="Star Wars 12" /> As a result, Starros came to believe that the only thing Solo was good for was lying, likening him to a "scoundrel."<ref name="Star Wars 6">''[[Star Wars 6: Skywalker Strikes, Part VI]]''</ref>

====Monsua Nebula====
{{Quote|The Monsula Nebula. I knew it. A Dog always returns to its favorite den, doesn't it?|Sana Starros on Han Solo returning to the Monsula Nebula|Star Wars 5: Skywalker Strikes, Part V}}
Solo and Chewbacca would crash-land on [[Unidentified planet (Monsua Nebula)|an unnamed planet]] in the [[Monsua Nebula]] that was entirely covered in electrical super-storms and cyclones.<ref name="Star Wars 5">''[[Star Wars 5: Skywalker Strikes, Part V]]''</ref> But beneath the storms, a beautiful oasis laid.

He and Chewbacca used the den several times over the years.<ref name="Star Wars 6" />

====Working for Jabba the Hutt====
Eventually, the pair came into the employment of the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] [[crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the [[Hutt]], who was based on the [[desert]] planet [[Tatooine]]<ref name="Episode I">[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']]</ref> and was the leader of the powerful [[Hutt Clan]].<ref name="Eminence">{{TCW|Eminence (episode)|Eminence}}</ref> Solo and Chewbacca smuggled for Jabba for many years<ref name="Star Wars 1" /> and Solo became Jabba's top smuggler. The smuggling duo also spent much time in [[Chalmun's Cantina]] looking for work.<ref name="Ultimate" />

====Bounty Hunted====

=====Dropping Jabba's Cargo=====
[[File:Han & Chewie approaching a blockade.JPG|thumb|260x260px|right|Han and chewie approach a Imperial blockade but escape to the [[planet]] below them.]]
At one point, Solo and Chewbacca were smuggling for Jabba when they were faced with an [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] blockade. Faced with the choice of either surrendering to the Empire or dropping Jabba's cargo, they dropped the cargo, and escaped to the [[Unidentified planet (Han Solo)|planet]] below.<ref name="CYD">''[[Choose Your Destiny: A Han & Chewie Adventure]]''</ref>

=====Repairing the Falcon=====
Solo and Chewbacca began repairing the Falcon, which was damaged in the escape, until they realized that the planet was inhabited by the crime lord [[Rekias Nodo]]. Posing as Jabba, he convinced Nodo to repair the ship, but he then found out that Nodo had dozens of prisoners, including [[Meecha Odon]]. Before he could act, the crime boss [[Lallani]] showed up looking for Jabba.<ref name="CYD" />

=====Escape from Nodo=====
The two crime bosses started a shootout, so Solo and Chewbacca used the chaos to escape, freeing the prisoners and stealing several barrels of rhydonium in the process. Solo intended to keep the rhydonium to pay for the cargo he dropped, but Chewbacca convinced him to give it to Meecha Odon and the other freed prisoners.<ref name="CYD" />

Later, while they were at the [[Valtos space port|space port]] on [[Valtos]], Solo was loading supplies on to the ''Millennium Falcon'' when he was captured by the [[bounty hunter]]s [[4-LOM]] and [[Zuckuss]].<ref name="FCBD 2018">{{IDWAdventuresCite|Free Comic Book Day 2018|Hunter vs Hunted}}</ref> The duo informed Solo that Rekias Nodo had put a bounty on his head.

After dumping Ford in a barrel with a homing beacon,<ref name="FCBD 2018" /> Solo and Chewbacca were pursued by the ''[[Mist Hunter]]''.

<nowiki> </nowiki>The four scoundrels soon found that the planet was inhabited by a horde of [[droid]]s that wanted to eradicate all life in the galaxy. The four escaped in the Falcon, but Han and Chewie tricked the bounty hunters into thinking that the Falcon lost power, and the two hunters fell for the trick, jumping back to the planet below.

====Captured by Alinka Aloo====
At one point, while on [[Coruscant]] after a smuggling job, Chewbacca and Solo were approached by¬†[[Alinka Aloo]], the daughter of¬†[[Sim Aloo]]. Aloo, wanted to hire them for a [[Mission to Ushruu|job]], and requested that they go to her¬†tower. A¬†week later, they went to see her, and she told them that she had a¬†[[tooka]]-sitting job for Chewbacca on the planet [[Ushruu]], and Solo was to remain with her. They reluctantly accepted, and Solo remained with Aloo. But she took Solo prisoner, and told Chewbacca that he wouldn't be set free unless the job, which wasn't actually a tooka-sitting job, was completed. Chewbacca later returned from the failed job and broke Solo out of captivity with the help of [[Mayvlin Trillick]] and a bunch of [[Corellian hound]]s. They then escaped Coruscant and a squadron of TIE fighters.<ref name="Mighty Chewbacca">''[[The Mighty Chewbacca in the Forest of Fear!]]''</ref>

====Mission to Rendel====
{{Quote|Rendel? No problem at all...for Han Solo!|Han Solo|Tales from Vader's Castle 3: The Briar Witch}}
After the mission to Ushruu, Han Solo and Chewbacca took a [[Mission to Rendel|mission]] to free [[planet]] [[Rendel]] from a curse. The job was to deliver a single statuette for a one million [[credit]]s. Unfortunately Chewbacca was unhappy with the mission because he thought the planet was cursed. When they arrived on Rendel, they found the planet was smothered in [[thorn]]s the size of [[Rancor]] [[Tooth|teeth]]. Right when they walk out of the ''Millennium Falcon'', the tracker says that they must deliver the statuette in the middle of a giant thorn patch. During the deliver of the statuette in the thorn patch, Solo and Chewbacca ran into a [[Cranan star-hopper]]. They found out that it was
[[File:Han on Rendel.JPG|thumb|266x266px|left|Han realizes he should have stayed with Chewie.]]
[[Karamu]]'s and [[SV-3]]'s [[Starship|ship]] after they found Karamu's [[droid]] Ess-Vee-Three. All of sudden Ess-Vee-Three told that the [[Bellan]] the Emerald [[Witch]] was waiting for him in the [[forest]]. Immediately Han told Chewie that there's no witch,
[[Vine/Canon|vines]] must've gotten into his central processor, and there's nothing to be afraid of. Later Han just went alone to deliver the statuette because Chewie was to scared. It wasn't long before Solo realized he should have stayed with Chewie when a vine has caught his [[Limb|leg]]. Solo was on the ground trying to get unstuck until he found Karamu stuck into vines. Solo tried to get free him but a [[Color|pink]] [[flower]] sprayed Solo and make him look older. Solo was able to free Karamu but they both got stuck later.
[[File:Han is sprayed.JPG|thumb|273x273px|right|Han is sprayed by a pink flower.]]
Then [[Zalla]], the sister of Bellan the [[Queen]] of Rendel came to Solo and Karamu and had a conversation with them about that when she cursed Rendel because she was jealous when her sister became Queen so she drove her sister of the planet, and her sister Bellan became known as the Emerald Witch. Soon after Chewie came and saved Solo and Karamu. Solo then kicked the statuette at the Collector and the [[plant]]s and vines started to [[Death|die]]. Zella then fell to her knees and started to sadden and die. After Zalla's death, the planet was lifted from the curse and Chewie, Solo, and Karamu escaped on the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name="Castle 3">''[[Tales from Vader's Castle 3: The Briar Witch]]''</ref>

===Galactic Civil War===
====A fateful business venture====
{{Quote|Seventeen-thousand! Those guys must really be desperate&mdash;this could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get it ready.|Han Solo, to Chewbacca, after meeting with Kenobi and Skywalker|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}
[[File:Charter negotiations.jpg|thumb|left|225x225px|Solo and Chewbacca negotiate passage fees with Kenobi and Skywalker in Chalmun's Cantina.]]
At some point, Solo and Chewbacca had a 50,000-credit bounty placed on their head after dropping a cargo of spice they were smuggling for Jabba. They traveled to Chalmun's Cantina on Tatooine to look for work to pay off Jabba.<ref name="Character Encyclopedia">''[[Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded]]''</ref> Chewbacca soon met [[Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], also known as Ben Kenobi, who was seeking charter to the [[Alderaan system]] on a [[Secret mission to Tatooine|mission of vital importance]] for the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. Kenobi defended young Skywalker from the criminals [[Ponda Baba]] and [[Cornelius Evazan]] with [[Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber (Jedi Master)|his lightsaber]]; revealing himself as a Jedi before making their way to Solo's booth. They arrived and began bartering terms of the deal. Solo assured Kenobi that the ''Millennium Falcon'' was the fastest ship around, because it had made the [[Kessel]] Run in less than twelve parsecs. Kenobi informed Solo that the cargo was only himself, Skywalker and two droids, and that they wanted to avoid Imperials entirely. Therefore, Solo set the price at 10,000 credits&mdash;higher than he normally would have. However, Kenobi raised Solo's bid to 17,000 credits: 2,000 in advance and 15,000 when they reached Alderaan. Solo was perplexed that Kenobi had raised his bid and quickly accepted the deal. The smuggler then told his temporary employer to meet him in [[Docking Bay 94]] for departure as soon as he was ready, before warning Kenobi that some Imperial [[sandtrooper]]s had entered the cantina and were looking for Evazan and Baba's attacker. Kenobi and Skywalker hastily fled, leaving Solo to express his elation to Chewbacca at having garnered such a high-paying job to pay off Jabba. Chewbacca left as well right after.<ref name="Episode IV" />

As Solo got up to leave, he was confronted by one of Jabba's bounty hunters: the [[Rodian]], [[Greedo]]. Greedo demanded to be paid Jabba's debt, or he would take Solo's dead body back to Jabba as payment. Solo, then, in self defense, covertly pulled his [[DL-44 heavy blaster pistol|DL-44]] [[blaster pistol]] and shot Greedo from under the table a fraction of a second after Greedo fired his own weapon&mdash;though, Solo hit his target and Greedo did not. Solo ignored the [[Murder tax]]<ref name="Star Wars 4">''[[Star Wars 4: Skywalker Strikes, Part IV]]''</ref> Jabba enforced on Tatooine, opting instead to simply toss [[Wuher]], the cantina's [[bartender]], some [[credit chip]]s, before apologizing for leaving a mess and then heading to Docking Bay 94.<ref name="Episode IV" />

[[File:HanJabbaDockingBay94.png|thumb|right|284x284px|Jabba confronts Solo over Greedo's death and restitution for the spice shipment Solo lost.]]
Solo arrived in the docking and found Jabba himself, with several of his guards&mdash;including<ref name="Episode IV" /> Jabba's top bounty hunter [[Boba Fett]]&mdash;<ref name="Ultimate" />looking for him near the ''Falcon''. Jabba inquired as to whether Solo was going to pay him, and why he had "fried poor Greedo." Jabba was disappointed in having to put the bounty on Solo;<ref name="Episode IV" /> the crime lord's top smuggler.<ref name="Ultimate" /> Solo insisted he had had no choice but to dump the cargo, and informed the Hutt that he had secured a charter that would be able to compensate the Hutt's loss in full as soon as he completed it. Jabba was pleased and added that if Solo paid twenty percent interest all could be forgotten, however, Solo talked him down to fifteen percent, and ironically stated that the Hutt was a "wonderful Human being," before entering the ''Falcon''.<ref name="Episode IV" />

A short time later, Kenobi, Skywalker, and their two droids, the [[protocol droid]] [[C-3PO]], and the [[astromech droid]] [[R2-D2]], boarded the ''Falcon'' after Skywalker remarked that the ''Falcon'' appeared to be a "piece of junk." Solo corrected him: The ''Millennium Falcon'' looked out-of-shape, but had been given "special modifications" that made it one of the fastest ships in the galaxy.<ref name="Episode IV" /> Just then, a [[Squadron|squad]] of stormtroopers appeared in the docking bay and opened fire on Solo. Solo fired back while retreating on board and shouted for Chewbacca to take off. The ''Falcon'' blasted away from the Mos Eisley spaceport and clear of Tatooine. Solo inserted coordinates to the Alderaan system into the ''Falcon''{{'}}s [[navigation computer]] while teaching farmboy Skywalker the importance of entering the correct coordinates&mdash;If it was not done correctly, the ship could run into any number of dangers associated with space travel. The ''Falcon'' outran two Imperial Star Destroyers and jumped into [[hyperspace]].<ref name="Episode IV" />

[[File:Falcon-lounge.png|thumb|left|259x259px|The ''Millennium Falcon''{{'}}s passengers pass the time while traveling to Alderaan.]]
While en route to Alderaan, Solo boasted of outrunning the "Imperial [[Slug (creature)|slugs]]," but was annoyed when no one would humor him. Chewbacca and R2-D2, often shortened to Artoo, were playing a game of [[Dejarik]] when Artoo outplayed the Wookiee, so Solo warned the droids not to upset him because Wookiee rage was not something C-3PO, often shortened to Threepio, a droid programmed in protocol would want to experience. Skywalker, meanwhile, trained with a [[Marksman-H training remote|remote]] with [[Skywalker's lightsaber|his lightsaber]], trying to [[Form V|deflect]] the [[Sting (power setting)|sting bolts]] with the civilized weapon. Solo was skeptical of [[the Force]]&mdash;the energy field that connected all living things in the galaxy, and the Jedi, like Kenobi, were able to use to perform seemingly supernatural feats&mdash;because in all his travels he had never seen proof that pointed to its existence; to Solo, it was all "simple tricks and nonsense." Kenobi took Solo's skepticism as a challenge and put a helmet over Luke's face so he couldn't see. Skywalker tried to deflect the bolts again, and did, while unable to see. Solo was mildly impressed, but acquitted Skywalker's ability to luck.<ref name="Episode IV" />

[[File:Tractor beam falcon death star recrop.jpg|thumb|right|253x253px|The ''Falcon'' is pulled into the Death Star by the station's tractor beams.]]
Immediately after, the ''Falcon'' emerged from hyperspace in the Alderaan system. The ''Falcon'' came out at Alderaan's galactic coordinates, but into a [[meteor shower]], with Alderaan nowhere in sight. Kenobi, using the Force, realized the [[asteroid]] field was Alderaan: The entire planet had been destroyed by the Empire. Solo couldn't believe the Empire had had enough firepower to do so, even with their entire fleet, but then an Imperial short-range [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighter]] appeared, seemingly confirming Kenobi's suspicions. Skywalker and Solo both conflated that if the fighter identified them as the freighter that had blasted away from Tatooine, they would be damned. Therefore, Solo got in range to destroy it. Kenobi, however, argued against it before Solo realized that the fighter did have a base; what appeared to be a small moon that was seen in the distance. Kenobi quickly surmised that the moon was not a moon, but an Imperial [[space station]], the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]] [[battle station]] equipped with a [[superlaser]] that was capable of destroying entire planets. Solo was shocked at the Death Star's 120 [[kilometer]] spherical diameter and prepared to turn the ''Falcon'' around and retreat. One of the station's [[tractor beam]]s, however, began to pull the ''Falcon'' in. Solo prepared to fight his way out once they were taken aboard and shut the freighter down. Kenobi was able to talk Solo into listening to him, though: hide instead of fight. Therefore, they ejected the ''Falcon''{{'}}s five [[Model CEC Class-1]] [[escape pod]]s and hid themselves in the ''Falcon''{{'}}s [[smuggling compartment]]s located under the floor.<ref name="Episode IV" />

====Rescuing the Princess of Alderaan====
{{Quote|Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her, or I'm beginning to like her!|Solo to Skywalker, after Organa took the lead in their escape|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}
The freighter was pulled into [[Docking Bay 327]] where it was boarded and quickly searched by stormtroopers on the orders of [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]],<ref name="Episode IV" /> the Emperor's chief [[lieutenant]] and a [[Dark Lord of the Sith]].<ref name="Vader Databank">{{Databank|darth-vader|Darth Vader|archivedate=20170703151730}}</ref> After the troopers left, Solo and the others emerged from the compartments and Kenobi devised a plan to disable the tractor beam from inside the station. As they worked out the plan's details, an Imperial [[Sensor|scanning]] crew came aboard to more thoroughly search the ship. Solo shot them and then impersonated the crew, yelling out to a pair of stormtroopers outside for assistance. They came, Solo shot them, and he and Skywalker dressed themselves in [[Stormtrooper armor|their armor]].<ref name="Episode IV" />

[[File:Han luke stormarmor.png|thumb|left|264x264px|Solo and Skywalker argue over whether to rescue the princess imprisoned aboard the Death Star.]]
Skywalker, now under the guise trooper [[TK-421]], fooled an officer into opening the door to the hangar's [[Docking Control Room 327|control room]]. Chewbacca and Solo cut down the officer and his comrades, while Artoo plugged into a computer terminal to locate the tractor beam controls. Artoo found them and Kenobi departed to disable it after commanding the others to stay in the control room. Solo was fine with staying; he'd gotten much more than the he's signed on for in the cantina. Artoo, however, had learned that [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Organa]] of Alderaan and a leading member of the Rebel Alliance, was aboard the station, and was scheduled to be executed in [[Detention Block AA-23]] very soon. Skywalker insisted that they go [[Rescue of Princess Leia|rescue her]], and reasoned that if Kenobi had known she was present, he would have gone after her, too. Solo at first refused, but decided it was worth the risk when Skywalker and Chewbacca assured him there would be a huge reward from the Rebel Alliance if she was rescued. Skywalker quickly worked out a subterfuge to bluff their way into the prison using Chewbacca as a prisoner scheduled for a prisoner transfer.<ref name="Episode IV" />

Soon thereafter, they set out to the fifth level of the Death Star with their "prisoner" in [[stuncuffs]] and left the droids behind. They arrived at the detention level and told the officer in charge, [[Shann Childsen]], of the supposed transfer. He went to check the legitimacy of the fake stormtroopers' claim, while other troopers went to detain the Wookiee. Chewbacca, per the plan, attacked. Solo kept up the charade while firing on the guards and [[security camera]]s. Solo located the princess's cell in the prison computer and sent Skywalker to get her while he tried to convince a [[technician]] that nothing had gone wrong via a [[Comm unit/Legends|comm system]], before giving up and shooting the panel when the tech saw through the ruse and sent stormtroopers to investigate.<ref name="Episode IV" />

[[File:Into the garbage chute flyboy.jpg|thumb|right|249x249px|Organa takes command of her own rescue mission and orders Solo to jump into a garbage chute.]]
The troopers blockaded the only exit to the detention block and attacked. Solo and Chewbacca returned fire while they retreated to Skywalker's position. Skywalker had gotten the princess, who critiqued their plan to rescue her without thinking through an escape route. Solo quipped that she was welcome to return to her cell and be executed rather than rescued if she desired, while they took cover in the corridor and traded fire with the Imperials. Organa lost patience with the three men, took a blaster and shot open a chute and dove in after telling the others to follow. Solo remarked to Skywalker that he wasn't sure if he was very frustrated with Organa, or if he was beginning to like her, and shoved Chewbacca into the chute. Skywalker and Solo followed right after.<ref name="Episode IV" />

They found themselves in a [[Garbage masher 3263827|garbage compactor]] with the only exit locked. Solo sarcastically told Organa great work in getting them nowhere and tried to shoot the open the exit. The laser bounced wildly around the [[Garbage compactor|compactor]], nearly hitting the rebels. Skywalker informed Solo that he had already tried it, that it was [[Magnetic seal|magnetically sealed]]. Organa commanded Solo to put his blaster away. Solo was unhappy at being ordered around, but did so. Just then, a low growl sounded; the four simultaneously realized they weren't alone. A moment later, a tentacle belonging to [[Omi|a]] [[dianoga]] grabbed Skywalker and pulled him under water. Solo and Organa frantically searched for him, and seconds later he reemerged. Solo grabbed Skywalker and tried to shoot the creature, but Skywalker was pulled under again. Solo had almost given up looking when the dianoga released him and vanished. Solo helped him up, before the walls of the compactor began to close in. Chewbacca the princess and Solo tried to brace them while Skywalker contacted the droids in order for Artoo to hack into the station's network and shut down the compactor. After a bit of a delay, Artoo succeeded. The three Humans and the Wookiee rejoiced, for their lives had been saved.<ref name="Episode IV" />

[[File:Leia smug han appalled.jpg|thumb|left|226x226px|Solo was appalled at Organa's ignorance to his authority as her rescuer.]]
They left the compactor and Skywalker and Solo took off the trooper armor. As they did so, Chewbacca heard strange noises coming from the compactor and ran away. Solo fired a laser blast into the compactor to prove that the Wookiee was acting with cowardice. Organa scolded him for making so much noise, and told him that he would have to take orders from her if they were going to survive the ordeal. Solo was appalled at Organa's demeanor, and informed "her worshipfullness" that he only took orders from himself. Leaving Organa to quip that it was amazing that the smuggler was still alive. Solo looked at Skywalker and muttered that no reward was worth putting up with the princess's attitude.<ref name="Episode IV" />

As the group made their way back towards the docking bay, they ran into a group of stormtroopers. Solo yelled for Skywalker and Organa to go to the ''Falcon'' while he and his first mate charged the troopers. The troopers turned and ran from the screaming smuggler. Solo, however, ran into the troopers' reinforcements, and then he was being chased. He ran back into the hangar and through a [[blast door]] as it closed; stopping the troopers who had pursued him and Chewbacca. Solo caught up with Skywalker and Organa who had also run into some trouble, and they prepared to board the ''Falcon'', but several stormtroopers stood guard outside. The troopers, however, rushed to Darth Vader who was locked in [[lightsaber combat]] with Kenobi. The group took advantage of the distraction Kenobi had created to rush aboard the freighter&mdash;except for Skywalker, who stopped. Kenobi saw that Skywalker and the others would be safe, so he let himself be cut-down by the Dark Lord. Skywalker yelled in grief, alerting the troopers to their presence. The troopers opened fire, but Solo ran and started up his ship, and once everyone was on board, blasted off and away from the battle station. There troubles were not over, however: four Imperial TIE fighters were in pursuit.<ref name="Episode IV" />

[[File:Han kills a tie.jpg|thumb|right|263x263px|Solo shoots down a TIE fighter using the ''Falcon''{{'}}s turrets.]]
Chewbacca piloted the ''Falcon'' in order for Skywalker and Solo to man its turrets to fight off the attackers. A dogfight ensued, where Solo shot down one fighter and congratulated Skywalker when he shot one down, as well&mdash;and advised him to not "get cocky." Solo soon shot down the final Imperial fighter and sighed in relief as they entered hyperspace to travel to [[Yavin 4]]&mdash;the location of the Rebels' [[Great Temple (Yavin 4)|hidden base]]. While en route to the [[Yavin system]], Organa grimly informed Solo that the Imperials had let them escape in order to track them to the hidden base, which explained the relative ease of their escape. Solo, didn't believe it had been easy and demanded to know what information Artoo was carrying that made him so special. Organa told him: the [[Death Star plans|technical readouts]] to the Death Star. Solo was shocked, and added that once he was rewarded, he was going to leave; he claimed he wasn't interested in the Rebels' revolution or the princess as a companion. Organa assured Solo that if all he loved was money, that's all he would receive, and stomped away. Skywalker took her place and asked the smuggler what he thought of the princess. Solo admitted she had spirit, and inquired to whether Skywalker could see Organa and Solo together. Skywalker quickly said "no," thereby admitting he had his own feeling for the princess&mdash;much to Solo's amusement.<ref name="Episode IV" />

====A change of conscience====

[[File:Yavin 4 Temple.png|thumb|left|268x268px|Solo and his friends arrive at the Rebel base on Yavin 4.]]
The ''Falcon'' soon reached Yavin 4 where Solo and the others were welcomed; Alliance [[Alliance High Command]] had feared that Organa had died with her world. The plans within Artoo were analyzed and a weakness was discovered: a two-meter wide [[Thermal exhaust port|exhaust port]] that led to the station's main [[reactor]]. Solo and Chewbacca attended a briefing for the [[Rebel pilot]]s, including Skywalker, who were going to attack the station when it inevitably arrived. [[General]] [[Jan Dodonna]] explained that a one-man starfighter could get close enough and fire [[proton torpedo]]es into the shaft that would cause a chain reaction that would destroy the station. Solo was skeptical, thinking it [[suicide]] to even attempt. Therefore, after he was given his reward of credits, he packed up to leave, but was confronted by Skywalker who insisted he stay and fight with the Rebellion. Solo, thinking selfishly of his debt with Jabba, refused, and asked Skywalker to come with him and Chewbacca. Skywalker was dismayed with Solo's selfishness and angrily walked away. Solo called after him an old Jedi saying: "[[May the Force be with you]]." Chewbacca was disappointed in Solo&mdash;he wanted to stay and fight.<ref name="Episode IV" />

Solo and Chewbacca then left Yavin 4 aboard the ''Millennium Falcon''. Soon, however, Chewbacca's nagging and Solo's conscience eventually got the better of the smuggler and he turned around and headed towards the Death Star where the [[Battle of Yavin|battle]] was raging&mdash;although he did so not for the Rebellion's cause, but to save his friend, Skywalker.<ref name="Han Insider">{{InsiderCite|158|Solo Journey}}</ref> He arrived in his ship to find Skywalker in his [[T-65B X-wing starfighter]] being pursued by three TIE fighters, lead by Darth Vader, in the station's [[meridian trench]]. Solo fired on the three Imperial fighters, destroying one, and causing another to panic and collide with Vader, who was sent spinning away from the battle station. Solo yelled in glee and told Skywalker to fire his torpedoes, since he was now clear to do so. Skywalker did, and it was a direct hit: The Death Star blew apart<ref name="Episode IV" /> and killed everyone on board.<ref name="Darth Vader 1">''[[Darth Vader 1: Vader]]''</ref> Vader, however, managed to escape after regaining control of his fighter. Of the thirty Alliance ships that had participated in the battle, only three returned to the base with Solo in the ''Falcon''. Solo rushed to Skywalker as he exited [[Red Five (X-wing starfighter)|his fighter]] and congratulated him, while the princess embraced Solo in his bravery and proving there was more to him than money.<ref name="Episode IV" />

[[File:Leia honors Han and Luke.jpeg|thumb|right|254x254px|Organa awards Solo and Skywalker for their selflessness during the Battle of Yavin.]]
A rushed<ref name="Ultimate" /> [[Royal Award Ceremony|award ceremony]] was held later for the heroes of the battle; which included Solo. The three awardees, Solo, Skywalker and Chewbacca, walked the aisle past hundreds of Alliance personnel. They reached the stage, where Organa placed a [[Medal of Bravery|medal]] around Solo's neck as he winked at her. Skywalker was given his [[medal]] and they bowed to the princess and turned as the crowd clapped for them.<ref name="Episode IV" /> Organa delivered her speech, next. She asked them all to not forget the lives lost on Alderaan and during the battle, including her<ref name="Leia 1">''[[Princess Leia, Part I]]''</ref> adopted [[parent]]s,<ref name="Episode III">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref> [[Viceroy]] [[Bail Organa]] and [[Queen]] [[Breha Organa]]. Dodonna followed up by informing the base's population their next course of action: [[Evacuation of Yavin 4|evacuate Yavin 4]]. The ceremony was adjourned. Organa playfully told Solo that he and his first mate had better get work.<ref name="Leia 1" />

Sometime following the battle of Yavin, Solo accepted a commission in the [[Alliance Military]] as a captain.<ref name="Complete VD">''[[Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary, New Edition]]''</ref>

====Investigating Lotho Minor====
{{Quote|And I'm not giving up on this planet yet.|Leia Organa|Flight of the Falcon, Part 2: The Planet of Misfit Droids}}
After the [[Yavin 4]] [[Evacuation of Yavin 4|evacuation]],<ref name="Leia 1" /> Han, Leia, Luke, Chewbacca, and C-3PO, were sent by the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] to investigate the [[planet]] [[Lotho Minor]] for a new base. During the investigation, they ran into [[Homeworld|native]] [[droid]]s and a [[Sexes|male]] [[Duros]] named [[Akar Duel]]. Their actions made Han and the rest to leave Lotho Minor and knew that the planet was not a good location for a new rebel base.<ref name="The Planet of Misfit Droids">{{IDWAdventuresCite|15|[[Flight of the Falcon, Part 2: The Planet of Misfit Droids]]}}</ref>

====Mission to Cyrkon====
{{Quote|I'm not part of this! I'm not a part of your rebellion, I'm not a freedom fighter, and I don't work for you, Your Highness!''"<br />"''If you worked for me, I'd have fired you already.''"<br />"''If I worked for you, lady, I'd have quit.|Han Solo and Princess Leia Organa|Smuggler's Run: A Han Solo & Chewbacca Adventure}}
With the Falcon scheduled to leave shortly after the Battle of Yavin, it was already an hour late as it lay parked in the Great Temple following the rebel's victory. Leia Organa, helping oversee some of the last stages of the evacuation approached Han in an effort to get him to aid the Rebellion once more by rescuing Lieutenant [[Caluan Ematt]] of the elite rebel recon unit the [[Shrikes]]. Initially refusing, Han was eventually persuaded to come to the rebel's aid following pressure from his companion, Chewbacca. With an even larger bounty of 224,190 credits placed on his head,<ref name="Absolutely Everything" /> Han decided against his better judgment to aid the Princess, if only for feeling a pang of guilt for her and their doomed resistance movement. With the ''Falcon'' the fastest ship and only ship that could reach Ematt in time, Han and Chewie set course for the distant Outer Rim world of [[Cyrkon]] where Ematt had been last heard from. Narrowly escaping an the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Vehement]]'' by changing their ship's [[Identification Friend or Foe transponder|IFF transponder]], the two landed in the city's capital, [[Motok]], where they ran into a [[Captivator's crew|gang]] of bounty hunters set out to capture the reward Jabba had put on their heads. Feigning surrender and stalling for time, Han offered to give over the money they had to pay off their debts to Jabba for their lives. Nonetheless, the arrival of [[Imperial Security Bureau|ISB]] [[Commander]] [[Alecia Beck]] and a quartet of stormtroopers interrupted the firefight, in which Han pretended to be the victim of a gang of rowdy rebels. With the bounty hunters now engaged fighting the stormtroopers, Han and Chewie ran off to meet with their old friend [[Delia Leighton]] of the starship ''[[Serendipity|Miss Fortune]],'' a moving bar that could pack up and leave whenever local authorities realized their operations and evasion of property taxes. While initially refusing to believe that Han was working with the Rebellion, Delia ultimately agreed to help Han by providing him with the location of Ematt in a low-rent [[hotel]] on the outskirts of town. Heading there in a recently purchased high-end speeder, which Han intended to bill the Alliance, the gang of bounty hunters they had run into previously also followed them there after interrogating Delia and threatening to kill her longtime [[Curtis|friend]]. Unbeknownst to Han, Chewbacca and Ematt, the bounty hunters realizing their situation for fighting the Empire earlier agreed to help the Imperials by hunting down Han Solo and the rebel he was supposed to meet, with Alecia Beck having previously ambushed Ematt's team members of [[Taanab]]. Not intending to have Ematt commit suicide as his team members did to protect the sensitive information in their heads, Beck ordered over forty stormtroopers to take up positions in and around the hangar where the Falcon was parked as the bounty hunters chased Han back towards his ship.<ref name="Smuggler's Run" />

[[File:Beck_apprehends_Solo.png|thumb|left|242x242px|Commander Alecia Beck captures Han Solo and his crew.]]
Arriving in the hanger to be surrounded by stormtroopers, Han and his compatriots believed they were done for. Nonetheless, in an effort to escape, Han pretended to instigate Chewie by referring to him as his slave, in which Chewie would angrily retort. Starting a fight, the rebels would quickly assault the nearby Imperials attempting to cuff them as Delia and her ship, ''Miss Fortune'' opened fire on the hangar, with Delia seeking to make amends with Han for her forced betrayal. Firing at the two magnetic generators protecting the hangar from the toxic fumes of the planet outside, Han managed to escape with Chewie and Ematt along with Delia in her ship as they blasted off into the planets atmosphere. Needing time for the navigation computer to plot their jump to lightspeed, Han and Chewie manned the cockpit while Ematt manned both [[turbolaser]]s from the ships cockpit. Fending off several TIE fighters, the ''Miss Fortune'' suddenly took a hit to their navicomputer. After a moment's reflection, Han decided to help her and her ship instead of running away as he would have normally done, distracting the Star Destroyer as it utilized its tractor beam in an attempt to capture the ''Falcon''. Fixing their navicomputer, the ''Miss Fortune'' was able to jump to light speed however not before the Falcon was caught in the ''Vehement's'' lock. Han, horrified by the Empire's willingness to destroy its own fragile TIE fighters in the wake of their tractor beam to capture them, he fell into a freefall towards the planet in an effort to escape the beam. Due to the planet's gravity interfering with the tractor beam, Commander Beck ordered the Star Destroyer to move closer to attain its target, however he was ultimately forced to pull out after realizing that utilizing the tractor beam so close to the capital city of Motok would utterly destroy it, turning thousands of citizens against the Empire and resulting in mass media coverage of the atrocity. Backing off, the Falcon pulled up from its collision course with the city, and with its navicomputer plotted, jumped into the safety of hyperspace.<ref name="Smuggler's Run" />

====Secret mission and the Dragon Void Run====
Solo and Chewbacca left to earn credits to pay off Jabba. They took several smuggling jobs, but Solo was getting nervous and turning down jobs. He was approached by [[Katrull]] with an easy job but turned it down, stating the sector was under Imperial observation. After Katrull left, Solo noticed a [[Selentia|female]] he had seen previously on another planet. Getting suspicious, he decided to leave only to be stopped by her [[Adame|partner]] at gun-point. They escorted him back to the ''Falcon'', where Chewbacca greeted them. The two agents revealed themselves to be part of the Rebel Alliance. They explained that Princess Leia had sent them to borrow the ''Millennium Falcon'' for a special mission. Solo refused to allow his ship to used without him and returned to the Rebel fleet to confront the princess.<ref name="HS1">''[[Han Solo, Part I]]''</ref>

[[File:Han Solo 1 P11.jpg|thumb|right|251x251px|Han Solo meets with Princess Leia and General Cracken.]]When he arrived, he angrily asked Organa about her decision to use his ship without his permission or participation. She took him aside and led him to a meeting with [[Airen Cracken]]. Organa explained they had undercover agents they had to recover and decided to use the [[Dragon Void Run]] as cover to rescue them. She revealed that the Rebel leadership was worried about leaks and wanted to use a ship that wasn't aligned with the Rebel Alliance. Solo agreed to the mission, and accompanied Organa back to the docking bay. There, they feigned an argument so it wouldn't draw suspicion when the ''Falcon'' and her crew left the fleet.<ref name="HS1" />

Solo and Chewbacca arrived in the [[Gomar sector]], checked in with the race officials and attended a party with the other racers. When the other participants realized he was a smuggler and not a professional racer, they first attempted to have him thrown out and then proceeded to ridicule him. [[Loo Re Anno]] intervened, and explained Solo had heart and the loyalty of his crew and this made him worthy. The racers lined then lined up and made the jump to hyperspace to travel to the first checkpoint in the race. When they arrived, Solo found his ship under attack along with the other racers.<ref name="HS1" />

[[File:Han Solo 2 P10.jpg|thumb|left|254x254px|Han Solo realizes the key to winning this part of the race.]]Solo attempted to outmaneuver the attacking [[mine]]s, but was cut off by [[Delan Vook]]. Vook used the ''Falcon'' as a shield and fired on the attacking mines, hitting Solo's ship. Solo was angered by this and ran into Vook's ship, temporarily disabling it. As more of the mines attacked his ship, Solo noticed that they were ignoring the other racers who had been knocked out. He correctly surmised that the mines were programmed to attack ships that were powered up, so he turned off his engines and coasted across the finish line unscathed. Loo Re Anno attached a cable to the ''Falcon'' and used it to tow her ship safely across the finish line as well. She thanked Solo for the assistance. After landing on [[Unidentified planet (Dragon Void Run)|the planet]], Solo confronted Vook about firing on his ship. Loo Re Anno told Vook that it was against the rules to fire on or tamper with another racer's ship and that he could be disqualified if Solo wanted to file a complaint. Solo declined, but warned Vook to stay out of his way. As Solo walked away, he was stopped by a [[Unidentified Dug smuggler|Dug smuggler]] who warned him that he was in danger. He was then stopped by several stormtroopers, who place him under arrest. Solo was rounded up with the other racers of the Dragon Void Run as observers of the race protested. Vook complained about the Imperial interference and was attacked by a stormtrooper. Solo came to his defense and was knocked to the ground. Before any more fighting could take place, an [[Tomine|Imperial officer]] stopped it so that there wouldn't be any bad publicity.<ref name="HS2">''[[Han Solo, Part II]]''</ref>

Tomine told Solo he and the other racers were criminals. When the Imperial officer took offense at [[witness|Loo Re Anno's witnesses]], Solo stepped in to prevent the Imperials from harming them. The race officials managed to convince Tomine to let the race continue, and Solo ran back to his ship to start the next stage. Once on board, he found out that Chewbacca was injured while escorting the Rebel spy [[Bot (Duros)|Bot]] back to the ''Falcon''. They began the next stage of the race, and Bot explained his theory that one of the spies that Solo was tasked to pick up during the race was a murderer who was killing the other informants. Solo assured him that everything would be ok. The ship arrived at the next stage of the race, which was a grueling twelve hour run through a shifting debris field. Solo considered purposely disqualifying himself, which would still allow him to visit all the planets in the race without the risk of the race. He changed his mind and decided to complete the stage despite the danger. At the very end, the ''Falcon'' clipped some debris which caused it to slow down and possibly be disqualified but was saved when Vook hooked a tow cable onto the ship and pulled across the finish line. After landing, Solo left Chewbacca with the ''Falcon'' to go retrieve the second Rebel spy, but was followed by camera droids. One of Loo Re Anno's witnesses, who had attached itself to Solo, destroyed the camera droids so Solo could meet with the spy without being observed. Solo and the Rebel spy returned to the ''Falcon'', only to discover the spy had a history with Chewbacca and wanted to settle an old debt.<ref name="HS3">''[[Han Solo, Part III]]''</ref>

Once on the ''Falcon'', [[Dorae]] drew her blaster and explained that Chewbacca had killed her "[[Dorae's rathtar|baby]]", a newly hatched [[rathtar]] which was trying to kill Solo. She had planned on selling the creature and its death had caused her serious financial problems. Solo stepped in front of her blaster in an attempt to defuse the situation. Loo Re Anno and the Twi'lek racers [[Sotna]] and [[Nowk]], who were alerted to the danger by one of Lee Re Anno's witnesses, boarded the ''Falcon'' to assist Solo. Solo told the racers he was handling the situation and didn't need their help. Nowk confronted Solo and told him that the race shouldn't be used as cover for personal business. Lee Re Anno assured the Twi'lek that Solo wouldn't sully the race's reputation like that and then asked to speak to him privately. She described the history of the Dragon Void run and how her [[Loo Re Anno's grandmother|grandmother]] had founded the race. She told Solo she saw something greater than just a simple pilot in him, but Solo replied that he was just a good pilot and being a special person just caused trouble. The racers left his ship and Solo returned to the lounge where all his passengers were. Dorae questioned why Solo was working for the Rebel Alliance and told him she had joined after he financial problems caused her to lose her [[Dorae's bar|bar]]. As the race was about to resume, Dorae told him that they were waiting for the last of the Rebel operatives, and once they were aboard he should abandon the race and return to the fleet. Solo decided to delay taking off to wait for the others. A speeder approached the ''Falcon'', chased by stormtroopers and Solo told Chewbacca to start the engines in order to make a quick getaway. As the last of the Rebel spies boarded the freighter, Solo quickly left the planet chased by TIE fighters. Solo wondered why they weren't trying to destroy the ship, and Dorae explained they were trying to capture them. Solo jumped to hyperspace and escaped. When they were safe, Solo joined the rest of the passengers. [[U'Il]] explained that they were ambushed by the Empire because one of the Rebel spies in the group must be a traitor. She and Solo went into the cockpit and and discussed their plan of action. U'Il wanted to return to the Rebel base but Solo wanted to continue to the next leg of the race and try to determine who was giving information to the Empire. When they came out of hyperspace, he and the other racers were confronted by an Imperial fleet. U'Il suggested they flee, but Lee Re Anno conviced Solo and the other racers to continue the race.<ref name="Solo4">''[[Han Solo, Part IV]]''</ref>

Solo took evasive action and asked the other racers if they had any weapons on their ships. When they replied that they were unarmed, Chewbacca fired on a TIE fighter with the ''Falcon''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[quad laser cannon]]. During the fight, Dorae entered the cockpit and informed Solo that Aran had been murdered. Before he could react, Lee Re Anno summoned an [[interdimensional creature]] to distract the Imperials so the race could proceed. As the ''Falcon'' entered the [[Dragon Void]], Solo went to confront his passengers. Dorae criticized his decision to enter the Void, knowing that they could end up stranded and captured by the Empire. Solo deduced that Bot had killed Aran, and was attacked by the Duros with a hidden [[poison]] injector. He headbutted Bot, who was subdued by Chewbacca but not before Bot injected himself with the poison. Solo and Chewbacca returned to the cockpit to finish the race. He contacted Loo Re Anno and asked her about her plans for after the race. She explained to him that her life as a lone pilot was coming to an end, and she would either win the race or perish. The race continued on, and the starships approached the [[Dragon Void gate|gate]] that marked the end of the race. As they got closer, Solo managed to pilot the ''Falcon'' past [[Delan Vook's starship]] and the [[Starshot team]]. He drew even with [[Loo Re Anno's starship]] and managed to pass her when her starship was hit by fire from the pursuing Imperials. When he got near the gate, he realized he was dooming the legendary pilot to death, and veered off at the last minute which allowed Loo Re Anno to enter the gate first. His passengers were convinced they were going to be captured and killed by the Empire. U'Il suggested that Solo take her [[blaster]] and kill them all before the Empire could take them. The gate opened, and Loo Re Anno and the rest of her people emerged. She thanked Solo for allowing her to return to her people. She then reopened the gate, so the racers could return to the start of the race safely. Once clear of the Imperials, Solo returned to the Rebel base and delivered his passengers to Organa. She chided him on his rash behavior during the race. Solo reflected on the lesson he had learned from Loo Re Anno and decided to stay with the Rebels a while longer.<ref name="Solo5">''[[Han Solo, Part V]]''</ref>

[[File:Rebels arrive on Cymoon 1.png|thumb|right|254x254px|Solo leads the false envoy into Imperial Weapons Factory Alpha on Cymoon 1.]]
With the Empire's Death Star destroyed, Alliance High Command chose to press their advantage at the Empire's disarray by launching campaigns across the galaxy, targeting key Imperial worlds and facilities.<ref name="Star Wars 4" /> And when the Alliance learned of the Empire's decision to call on the Hutt Clan to supply the Imperial war machine with resources, Solo decided to co-lead a mission with Princess Leia: intercept the envoy from Jabba at [[Weapons Factory Alpha]] on [[Cymoon 1]], in the [[Corellian Industrial Cluster]]. Solo decided to stick with the Alliance in order to [[Attack on Cymoon 1|destroy]] the Empire's largest [[weapons factory]] and use his connections to the Hutt Clan to bluff their way into the [[factory]], pretending to be the Hutt's envoy after Rebels ship-jacked the true envoy and stole their ship; which Solo, Organa, Skywalker, and Artoo traveled to Cymoon 1 in. Chewbacca and Threepio, likewise, piloted the ''Falcon'' to Cymoon 1, landing undetected in the extensive [[Cymoon 1 refuse fields|fields of refuse]] that surrounded the factory.<ref name="Star Wars 1" />

Solo landed the transport at Weapons Factory Alpha without incident and the group emerged from the craft. Organa and Skywalker were disguised in Jabba's [[bodyguard]] armor, acting as Solo's bodyguards, so Solo introduced himself to the Imperial delegation: the [[Overseer]] of the facility, [[Aggadeen]]&mdash;whom Solo quickly gave the derogatory nickname of "Aggie"&mdash;a group of stormtroopers and a [[Unidentified LOM-series protocol droid|LOM-series protocol droid]]. After the protocol droid confirmed Solo's connections to the Hutts, "Aggie" lead the false envoy onto the factory floor after Solo and the others handed over their weapons to the stormtroopers. Solo played along, cocky and overconfident, claiming to Aggadeen that he was the being that had taught Jabba his shrewd business skills. "Aggie" was unimpressed and chided Solo for his ignorance, and revealed that there were, in truth, not going to be any negotiations: The Empire would state their demands and Solo would accept them on behalf of the Hutt Clan without argument.<ref name="Star Wars 1" />

Upon arriving at the conference room where Solo was to meet the Empire's negotiator, Solo and Artoo began the attack; Artoo, Skywalker, and Organa took the stormtroopers down in [[hand-to-hand combat]], while Solo held the Overseer at gun-point and demanded to know the direction to the facility's main power core. Aggadeen was horrified, but relented and sent them in the correct direction. While racing towards the core reactor, Organa contacted Threepio to ensure the droid would activate the ''Falcon''{{'}}s [[autopilot]] in order to pick them up once they finished their task. Threepio assured them that he would, and that he would take care of Solo's ship.<ref name="Star Wars 1" />

[[File:To the main power core.PNG|thumb|left|242x242px|The Rebels make their way to the facility's main power core in order to blow it up.]]
Solo, Organa, and Artoo then went to work rigging the core to explode. Skywalker, however, instead of standing guard as Solo had asked, fell into the Force and located several dozen slaves, which he freed. Solo grew worried at Skywalker's disappearance, but they finished [[Slicer|slicing]] into the reactor nonetheless, programming it to self-destruct in ten minutes time. Organa took time to thank Solo for defying his selfish nature to aid her and the Rebellion, she, however, questioned just why Solo would act so, wishing to know his true motives. Solo's motives were to help his new friend of Skywalker, but he was saved from admitting that he was also interested in Organa romantically when Skywalker returned to the reactor room with the slaves. Solo figured "the more the merrier" and called Threepio to tell him to start the ''Falcon''{{'}}s autopilot and pick them up. Chewbacca interrupted, bringing news of the arrival of the Empire's negotiator: Darth Vader. Solo ordered the Wookiee to retreat from the Dark Lord, but Organa countered Solo, telling Chewbacca to open fire in order to rid the galaxy of Vader.<ref name="Star Wars 1" />

Chewbacca consented, but was unable to defeat Vader and was forced to flee, falling out of contact with Solo's group. Solo called Threepio, inquiring as to where he and the ''Falcon'' were, regretting that the planned chain of events had gone awry. The protocol droid explained that he had not yet arrived because the freighter was being dismantled by [[Unidentified Cymoon 1 species|native scavengers]]. Solo told him to solve the problem and took off with Organa, Skywalker, Artoo, and the slaves in search of a way out of the factory. Solo located a hangar full of massive [[All Terrain Armored Transport]] [[walker]]s and proceeded<ref name="Star Wars 1" /> to hijack one such behemoth.<ref name="Star Wars 2">''[[Star Wars 2: Skywalker Strikes, Part II]]''</ref> Unbeknownst to the group, Skywalker had left the group in order to find and face Darth Vader, the man he believed had killed his Jedi father.<ref name="Star Wars 1" />

[[File:Han & Leia steel AT-AT.JPG|thumb|right|281x281px|Han and Leia has stolen a AT-AT.]]
Solo, Organa, Artoo, and several slaves boarded the walker, so Solo began their escape, barreling through the walls of the facility. Solo located Skywalker and Vader locked in lightsaber combat, so he brought the leg of the AT-AT into the confrontation, which forced the two combatants apart. The smuggler told Skywalker to follow him with the slaves, as he was going to clear a path out of the factory before it exploded. Organa saw Vader and ordered Solo to target him, while the slaves targeted the Imperial ground troops. As a consequence of the walker being just-made, the laser cannons were not yet operational, which kept Artoo and a pair of [[Jawa]]s busy while they worked on enabling them while Solo and Organa argued.<ref name="Star Wars 2" />

While the rebels continued in their escape, Solo brought the walker towards Vader, trying to crush him with the AT-AT's feet. However, Vader used the [[dark side of the Force]] to stop the walker. The dark power the Sith Lord wielded began to tear the behemoth apart. Solo was in disbelief at Vader's power&mdash;Solo was still not convinced that the power Skywalker and Vader wielded was real&mdash;and at Artoo's assurance that they were operational, opened fire on Vader with the walker's laser cannons, minorly injuring the Dark Lord and allowing Solo to pilot the walker outside of the facility into the refuse fields. In the moment of calm, Solo tried to contact both Chewbacca and Threepio, but both failed to answer, leaving Solo to be very grateful when Skywalker assured him that he was heading towards the rendezvous.<ref name="Star Wars 2" />

While continuing on their journey towards the ''Falcon'', Chewbacca roared over the comlink, relieving Solo that his friend was alive. Chewbacca then rescued Threepio from the tentacles of the scavengers and began to repair the damage they had done in order to pick up Solo and the others. However, Organa and Solo soon realized that the factory's reactor must have been defused because it had been long past ten minutes and it hadn't exploded. Just after, Darth Vader set himself upon stopping the stolen walker, which he did so by cutting down the walker's legs. Solo and Organa looked at each other in realization as Vader succeeded in his task: the walker crashed to the ground. Solo was injured in the crash and left battered and [[blood]]y. Organa and the slaves carried him from the wreckage while Skywalker covered them. The Jedi-to-be then returned to the factory mounted on a [[74-Z speeder bike]] and destroyed the core reactor; decimating the entire facility. Chewbacca, with the ''Falcon'' repaired enough to fly, picked up the rebels and they fled into hyperspace<ref name="Star Wars 3">''[[Star Wars 3: Skywalker Strikes, Part III]]''</ref> to the safety of the Rebel fleet.<ref name="Star Wars 4" />

Aboard one of the Rebel [[capital ship]]s, Solo was treated for the injuries he sustained. He and Chewbacca then repaired the ''Falcon''<ref name="Star Wars 4" /> best they could with the parts they were allowed by the Alliance deck crew.<ref name="Star Wars 5" /> Later, Solo advised Skywalker, who was leaving on a journey to return to Tatooine to continue his Jedi journey, to not leave because it was too dangerous. Skywalker left anyway, though, believing it something he needed to do.<ref name="Star Wars 4" />

[[File:Han and Chewir repair the Falcon.jpg|thumb|left|265x265px|Solo and Chewbacca repair the damage done to the ''Falcon'' aboard an Alliance cruiser after escaping Cymoon 1.]]
A short time later, after being denied access to the parts he needed to finish repairing the ''Millennium Falcon'', Solo went and inquired to Organa what it was going to take for him to get the parts so he could leave the Alliance and settle his debt with Jabba before bounty hunters started showing up to forcibly take him to Jabba. Organa chided him, explaining that the Rebellion couldn't afford to give away expensive items for free&mdash;Solo had to work for them. The princess informed the smuggler that she was going on a [[scout]]ing mission to locate a possible location for a new Rebel base, which Solo could act as her pilot on the mission and receive the parts he needed as payment. Solo agreed; though he was adamant that he would leave the Rebellion upon their return.<ref name="Star Wars 5" />

Solo and Organa soon set off aboard a stolen Imperial [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle|''Lambda''-class T-4a shuttle]], the ''[[Invictus]]'', and intended to scout several locals, including the [[Ganath Cloud]] and the [[Moons of Ovise]]. They began their search in the [[Moddell sector]]. Before they could truly begin, however, a pair of Imperial TIE fighters unexpectedly approached the shuttle and demanded identification from the ''Invictus''. Solo found it inexplicable that Imperials were as far out in the Outer Rim as they were, and prepared to put the shuttle through evasive maneuvers. The princess, stopped him, however, and transferred their stolen clearance codes to the [[TIE fighter pilot]]s. The pilots were about to clear the ''Invictus'', but Solo became impatient and put the shuttle through evasive maneuvers, tipping the Imperials off that the ''Invictus'' was not what it claimed to be; so the Imperials opened fire. Organa was furious at Solo, but as it was too late to rectify the situation, let Solo take the shuttle to an unnamed planet in the nearby Monsua Nebula. The TIEs didn't follow Solo through the planet's electrical super-storms, though that saving grace didn't change the princess's mind; she told the smuggler that she hated him.<ref name="Star Wars 5" />

[[File:Han loses his nerve.jpg|thumb|right|295x295px|Solo loses his nerve at the arrival of Sana Starros, who claimed to be his wife.]]
On the surface of the planet, Solo was satisfied when Organa forgot their troubles, admitting that she found it incredible that beneath the planet's atmosphere of super-storms, a beautiful oasis laid. Solo led her to his secret hiding place and offered her a glass of Corellian [[wine]] in an attempt to seduce her. The princess rejected Solo's invitation: she threw the wine into his face, stormed out of the cave, and berated him for getting side-tracked on their mission&mdash;especially when they were in danger. Organa argued that if Solo hadn't lost his nerve and alerted the TIEs that they weren't who they claimed to be, they wouldn't have been in the predicament in the first place. Solo countered that nothing in the entire galaxy could make him lose his nerve. However, a ship&mdash;the ''[[Volt Cobra]], ''Sana Starros' ship&mdash;appeared and fired a laser blast down at the pair. Solo recognized the ''Cobra'', lost his nerve, and told Organa to run. Confounded, Solo and Organa watched as Starros emerged from her freighter and introduced herself to the princess, pointing a blaster at her and claiming to be Sana Solo, Han's wife. Solo could only put his hand on his face and mutter "oh no."<ref name="Star Wars 6" />

Starros had placed probes in the atmosphere of the planet some time before<ref name="Star Wars 5" /> in an attempt to track Solo and it had paid off. Starros had taken it upon herself to make Solo's life miserable until he paid her share from the robbery on Stenness years earlier.<ref name="Star Wars 12" /> Organa was shocked that Solo had never told her he was married, though Solo made it clear that he wasn't. Starros greeted Solo with a kiss, and then struck him across the face, which lead Organa to decide that she wanted no part of their business. Solo called to the princess, pleading to her that Starros was not his wife. And when he did, Starros recognized the name of Princess Leia and decided to claim the bounty on Organa by turning her in to the Empire. Organa ignored them and went to return to the ''Invictus'', but Starros by voice-control, told the ''Cobra'' to destroy the shuttle, which it did, cutting of their escape. Solo was appalled at Starros' ruthlessness and was forced to let Starros frisk him; she took his DL-44 blaster pistol.<ref name="Star Wars 8">''[[Star Wars 8: Showdown on the Smuggler's Moon, Part I]]''</ref>

[[File:Starros Solo Organa.jpg|thumb|left|272x272px|Solo attempts to defuse the tension between Starros and Organa in the Monsua Nebula]]
Starros then contacted the Star Destroyer that had come to the planet after being alerted by the TIE that had originally pursued the ''Invictus'', telling them that she intended to claim the bounty on Organa. Solo whispered to Organa that he could make it right, though he wouldn't take Starros on in a gunfight: she was a better shot than him. The princess, however, took over Solo's plan; she kicked him into Starros and pulled a blaster pistol from her boot. Much to Solo's dismay, Organa held Starros and him at gunpoint, though Starros pointed out the flaw in Organa's plan: TIE fighters were already descending from the sky.<ref name="Star Wars 8" />

Several TIEs landed and their pilots emerged, ordering the trio to stand down. Organa [[Escape from the Monsua Nebula|opened fire]] on them. Solo pleaded with Starros to give him back his blaster, but she refused, only consenting when Solo lost his temper and admitted that he had joined the Rebel Alliance and was on the Empire's most wanted list. Solo and Starros raced aboard the ''Volt Cobra'', and Organa did, too, after realizing that Starros had given up on selling her to the Empire. Solo tried to persuade Starros to let him pilot her ship, but both she and Organa commanded him to "shut up" as they fled into space.<ref name="Star Wars 9">''[[Star Wars 9: Showdown on the Smuggler's Moon, Part II]]''</ref> Solo and Organa manned the ''Cobra''{{'}}s turbolasers, firing on the pursuing TIEs before Starros finally jumped to hyperspace.<ref name="Star Wars 10">''[[Star Wars 10: Showdown on the Smuggler's Moon, Part III]]''</ref>

While in hyperspace, Starros mused Solo, amused that he had become a Rebel. Solo berated Starros for continuing to claim to be his wife, reminding her that their marriage was illegitimate and part of a robbery they had both been a part of. Organa then interrupted, bringing news from the Rebel fleet that Skywalker was in trouble on the Hutt world of [[Nar Shaddaa]], the "smuggler's moon." Solo did not understand what his friend was doing there, but he would soon find out: Organa promised to pay Starros if she took them to Nar Shaddaa&mdash;and Starros accepted.<ref name="Star Wars 10" /> En route to Nar Shaddaa, Solo begged Organa to trust him rather than Starros, but Organa mostly ignored him and slammed a door in his face. Flustered, Solo decided to admit the truth&mdash;he explained the robbery on Stenness, where he had participated in a marriage ceremony with Starros that was faked. He went to apologize to her, but behind the door, Organa was gone. Solo slumped to the floor, wishing Chewbacca was with him.<ref name="Star Wars 11">''[[Star Wars 11: Showdown on the Smuggler's moon, Part IV]]''</ref>

[[File:Solo shot Dengar.jpg|thumb|right|245x245px|Solo and Organa stand over Dengar after shooting him in the back.]]
Shortly thereafter, the ''Cobra'' arrived on Nar Shaddaa at the coordinates of Chewbacca and Threepio, who had also answered Skywalker's distress call and come to his rescue. Chewbacca, however, had fallen afoul with the Corellian bounty hunter [[Dengar]], who had subdued the Wookiee in an attempt to lure Solo there so he could claim Jabba's bounty on Solo.<ref name="Star Wars 10" /> Enraged, Solo shot the bounty hunter in the back and demanded he take his "damn hands off" his friend.<ref name="Star Wars 11" /> Solo ordered Dengar to step away from Chewbacca and he would be allowed to live, but Dengar refused, instead he activated a [[thermal detonator]] that he threatened to detonate. Chewbacca, who was not hurt badly, took advantage of Dengar when he was distracted and threw the bounty hunter from the roof of the [[skyscraper]] where the [[grenade]] and Dengar exploded. With that settled, Solo made sure Chewbacca was alright. The group did not know where Skywalker was, but a flight of TIE fighters streaking through the sky, tipped them off; follow trouble to find Skywalker.<ref name="Star Wars 12" /> Immediately after, Solo and the group&mdash;including Starros, who had come to ensure Solo did not try to lose her&mdash;arrived at the location of the Imperial attention: the [[Palace of Grakkus the Hutt]], where Skywalker had been kidnapped<ref name="Star Wars 12" /> by [[Grakkus]] the Hutt,<ref name="Star Wars 9" /> an avid collector of all things Jedi. Grakkus had organized a [[gladiator]] fight between Skywalker and [[Kongo|Kongo the Disembowler]], a massive beast from the [[Volcano|molten]] world of [[Mustafar]].<ref name="Star Wars 10" /> As Solo led the group into the palace, the crowd that had come to watch the fight fled the arena because Kongo was on the loose. Solo and the others tried to fire on the monster, but an [[EMP blast]] triggered by Grakkus had disabled all electronics&mdash;including blasters. Confounded on how to proceed, the group was saved by Artoo, who located the group and threw Solo, Chewbacca, and Organa each lightsabers that belonged to Grakkus. Solo scoffed at using the weapon of [[Force-sensitive]]s, but with his DL-44 unusable, he charged into the [[Rescue of Luke Skywalker|melee]] with his first mate and the princess, cutting down stormtroopers and TIE pilots.<ref name="Star Wars 12" />

[[File:Lightsaber battle in the arena.png|thumb|left|272x272px|Solo wields a lightsaber for the first time in Grakkus's arena while rescuing Skywalker.]]
Solo soon located Skywalker and went to gather him so they could leave the smuggler's moon. Skywalker quipped that Solo looked good wielding the Jedi weapon, though Solo only wished he had his blaster at his side. Skywalker tried to persuade Solo to let him go back and claim more of Grakkus's Jedi artifacts, but Chewbacca hoisted the Jedi-in-training up and carried him back to the ''Falcon'' while Solo made sure Organa and Starros also made it out.<ref name="Star Wars 12" /> Starros made her peace with Organa and Solo, so she set off on her own in the ''Cobra''.<ref name="Star Wars 12" /> Skywalker, using "[[The Journals of Ben Kenobi]]" that he had claimed on Tatooine,<ref name="Star Wars 6" /> set out to the planet [[Vrogas Vas]], where an ancient [[Jedi Temple (Vrogas Vas)|Jedi temple]] was said to remain.

[[File:Solo reminds Organa.jpg|thumb|right|265x265px|Solo reminds the princess that her priorities should be with Skywalker&mdash;not getting revenge against Vader.]]
Some time later, the Rebel fleet was notified that Darth Vader had been shot down on Vrogas Vas by Alliance forces. Organa informed Solo that she intended to go after Vader to kill him, though Solo thought it foolish; Vader was too powerful. Solo realized, however, that Vrogas Vas was where Skywalker had gone, so he decided to put priority on making sure Skywalker was alright&mdash;not wishing to face Vader as the princess wanted. Soon thereafter, Solo, Chewbacca, Threepio, and Organa traveled to Vrogas Vas aboard the ''Falcon'' with a compliment of Rebel starfighters.<ref name="Vader Down 1" />

The YT-1300 freighter soon arrived at the Rebel [[Vrogas Vas refueling base|refueling base]] on Vrogas Vas, and he and the princess were briefed in the mission by an Alliance [[Unidentified Rebel captain|captain]]: Skywalker had brought Vader down by crashing his T-65 X-wing into Vader's TIE Advanced, the bravest thing the [[captain]] had ever seen. After receiving word that Skywalker's safety status was unknown, just that his fighter had crashed, Solo took it upon himself to rescue the "lucky, crazy kid." Solo expected Organa to do the same, but she put her focus on taking Vader down once and for all. Solo was shocked that the princess would do that, but he left her to lead an assault on Vader with the base's [[company]].<ref name="Darth Vader 13">''[[Darth Vader 13: Vader Down, Part II]]''</ref> Solo nonetheless left with Chewbacca in the ''Falcon'' and headed to the quadrant where Skywalker crashed, saddened at Organa's order of priories.<ref name="Star Wars 13">''[[Star Wars 13: Vader Down, Part III]]''</ref>

Upon arriving at the coordinate's where Skywalker crashed, Solo and Chewbacca saw explosions in the distance, so they quietly landed the ''Falcon'' near the source of the commotion. Solo hiked atop a ridge with a [[sniper rifle]], while Chewbacca headed around the ridge to intercept the mercenaries. Solo soon saw Skywalker, though he was unconscious and being carried by the [[assassin droid]] [[0-0-0]]. 0-0-0 was accompanied by his counterpart, the [[BT-1 assassin droid]] [[BT-1]], and their master, [[Doctor]] [[Chelli Lona Aphra|Aphra]], who had been hired by Vader to kidnap Skywalker.<ref name="Star Wars 13" />

[[File:Aphra and Han and waspworms.jpg|thumb|left|257x257px|Solo and Aphra, about to collide while covered with wasp-worms on Vrogas Vas.]]
Solo called out to Aphra and her droids, making it clear that he wanted to just save his friend.<ref name="Star Wars 13" /> Aphra, however, had researched Skywalker's associates<ref name="Darth Vader 13" /> and recognized Solo, so she thought she could anticipate his next moves. Aphra retorted to him that he would have shot first if he was any good at rescuing his friends. Solo recognized Aphra as the notorious gun thief, and listened to her threats, waiting for Chewbacca to get in position. Once the Wookiee was in position, he ripped off 0-0-0's&mdash;known commonly as Triple-Zero&mdash;arms before the droid could harm Skywalker. Aphra charged and took cover at the bottom of the ridge below Solo and they fired on one another while Chewbacca took on the assassin droids. Skywalker was awakened by Artoo in the ensuing chaos and forced to flee when BT-1&mdash;known commonly as Beetee&mdash;charged after them. With neither Solo nor Aphra able to gain the upper hand, they resorted to shooting each their own nests of [[wasp-worm]]s above each other's heads; which dropped the stinging [[worm]]s onto each other. Blinded and covered in worms, Solo tried to rip them off of himself, but ended up colliding head-on with Aphra. Skywalker, with Chewbacca and Artoo came and revived the smuggler and thanked him for coming to his rescue again. Triple-Zero and Beetee, however, confronted the Rebels, intending to kill them, which Artoo denied them when he sprayed a liquid into Beetee's [[Missile launcher|rocket launchers]] and chainguns, which caused the confused droid to launch his weaponry, blowing up the ridge around them.<ref name="Star Wars 13" /> Solo and the group fled the chaos back towards the ''Falcon'', and Solo called Threepio to tell him to inform the princess that they had rescued Skywalker, no thanks to her.<ref name="Darth Vader 14">''[[Darth Vader 14: Vader Down, Part IV]]''</ref>

Once at the ''Falcon'', Chewbacca explained that Triple-Zero had poisoned him with [[Mandalorian Xenetox]]. Artoo prepared to give him a medical shot that would reduce the effects of the Mandalorian Xenetox. Just then, a live message from Organa came over the ''Falcon''{{'}}s comm system, in which Organa ordered a squadron of Y-wing bombers to converge on her position and drop their payload on her because she had been captured by Vader, and in her death, Vader would also be killed. Solo quickly got his ship in the air and stubbornly told the princess over the comm that he was not going to let her sacrifice herself.<ref name="Darth Vader 14" />

[[File:Krrantan takes the blaster of Han.jpg|thumb|right|305x305px|Krrsantan takes Solo's DL-44 pistol.]]
However, before they could make any headway, an [[Black Krrsantan's Auzituck anti-slaver gunship|Auzituck anti-slaver gunship]] collided head-on with the ''Falcon'', knocking both starships into the ground below. Solo and Skywalker recovered themselves, and were met with the imposing figure of the Wookiee [[Black Krrsantan]],<ref name="Darth Vader 14" /> a bounty hunter working for Jabba, second only to Boba Fett..<ref name="Darth Vader 1" /> Solo pleaded with Krrsantan that it wasn't the time to collect Jabba's bounty on him. Unknown to Solo, however, Krrsantan was working alongside Doctor Aphra and had come to claim Skywalker to take to Aphra. Krrsantan blew a hole in the ''Falcon''{{'}}s cockpit using a [[Detonator/Legends|detonator]] and pulled Skywalker out. Solo was at first glad he hadn't come on Jabba's behalf, but then he realized that him taking Skywalker was no better. A duel between Wookiees then broke out when Chewbacca came to Skywalker's defense. Solo told the Skywalker to run and save Organa while Solo and Chewbacca took care of Krrsantan to insure they had a ship to escape Vrogas Vas in.<ref name="Darth Vader 14" />

Neither Wookiee managed to gain the upper hand for some time, so Solo drew his DL-44 pistol to help out his friend, but Krrsantan thwarted his attempt when he threw Chewbacca straight into the smuggler; knocking his blaster into the bounty hunter's grasp. Artoo emerged from the ''Falcon'' and informed Solo that he hadn't gotten a chance to give Chewbacca the shot to reverse the poison, so he sent a syringe flying into Chewbacca. Rejuvenated, Chewbacca quickly gained the upper hand against Krrsantan. Solo contacted Skywalker via comlink and asked whether he had located Organa yet, to which Skywalker replied with a warning, just as he was knocked unconscious by Imperial stormtroopers and captured. Before Solo could warn Artoo of Skywalker's capture, Krrsantan, who had managed to overpower Chewbacca using a dishonorable tactic, grabbed Solo around the neck and began choking him.<ref name="Star Wars 14">''[[Star Wars 14: Vader Down, Part V]]''</ref> Threepio, of all beings, confronted Krrsantan, urging him to release Solo and cease hostilities. Krrsantan did, and punched the golden droid. However, Threepio had lost both his arms to Triple-Zero, and when Krrsantan struck him, loose wiring protruding from the droid electrocuted and knocked the Wookiee out.<ref name="Darth Vader 15">''[[Darth Vader 15: Vader Down, Part VI]]''</ref>

[[File:Escaping Vrogas Vas.jpg|thumb|left|250x250px|Solo pilots his ship with his friends in escape of Vader and Vrogas Vas.]]
Shortly thereafter, Solo and Artoo revived Threepio and informed him that he had, against all odds, "saved the day." Chewbacca also came to and pointed to an Imperial ''Lambda''-class T-4a shuttle that was flying towards space. Solo had a bad feeling that Skywalker was aboard, and was overcome with guilt at realizing that he had let his friend get captured. Remarkably, the shuttle's engines blew and it crashed back to the ground. Solo and the others rushed towards the crash site and brought the Rebel pilot back to the ''Falcon'' while Solo mused that Skywalker must have had a guardian [[angel]], but Skywalker assured him as per usual, that the Force was with him&mdash;though Solo, as per usual, didn't believe it. Upon returning to his ship, Solo noticed that Krrsantan was nowhere to be seen, and that the hole that the bounty hunter had blown into the ''Falcon''{{'}}s cockpit had curiously been patched up. In answer to Solo's wondering, Aphra appeared and informed the rebels that they were standing in a field of [[micro-mine]]s, and she had her finger on the trigger to detonate the [[mine]]s. With little choice, Solo dropped his blaster and listened to Aphra contact Vader via comlink that she had Skywalker, Solo, and the others at her mercy. The rebels were shocked that Aphra had actually thrown in with the Sith Lord and was working for him. Before Vader could arrive, however, Organa finally made it back, having escaped Vader herself due to the timely arrival<ref name="Darth Vader 15" /> of one of Vader's rivals, the [[Mon Calamari]] General [[Karbin]],<ref name="Star Wars 14" /> and struck Aphra across the jaw, thereby also saving the day. Solo was very pleased to have Organa back with them, and they carried Aphra's unconscious body aboard the ''Falcon'' and they together escaped Vader and Vrogas Vas.<ref name="Darth Vader 15" />

====Smuggler, rebel, mentor, hostage====
{{Quote|How else are we gonna replace the money we just lost?''"<br />"''Heh, don't worry, kid. I know just the thing. It's a big galaxy. And believe me, there's always something somewhere in need of smuggling.|Skywalker and Solo|Star Wars 16: Rebel Jail, Part I}}
Upon to returning to the Rebel Fleet with their new [[prisoner]], Doctor Aphra, Solo and his friends went their separate ways; Organa, Artoo, and Threepio went to detain Aphra at an Alliance-controlled space station, [[Sunspot Prison]], with the assistance of Sana Starros, whom Organa hired to transport them to the prison. On the other hand, Solo and Skywalker were dispatched to buy supplies for the rebellion in the meantime.<ref name="Star Wars 16">''[[Star Wars 16: Rebel Jail, Part I]]''</ref>

[[File:Han Luke cheats at sabaac.jpg|thumb|right|267x267px|The rebel smugglers flee for their lives after Solo was caught cheating at sabaac]]
The rebel duo traveled back to [[Unidentified spaceport (Han Solo)|a spaceport]] of a [[Unidentified planet (sabacc)|planet]], as Solo had decided to try and double the Rebellion's credits by cheating his way through a game of sabacc against a green-skinned [[Unidentifed Dowutin|Dowutin]]&mdash;and in doing so, he hoped to make enough credits to begin to pay restitution to Jabba. Part way through the game, due to the large amounts of credits Solo was betting in overconfidence, the [[Dowutin]] began to suspect Solo of cheating. The smuggler lied, insisting that he was not, and reassured Skywalker's misgivings in Solo possibly losing the Alliance's money. A very short time later, the Dowutin and his cronies discovered that Solo was, in fact, playing a dishonest game and so Solo fled with Skywalker just behind&mdash;not wanting to discover if the Dowutin really was going to cut off their fingers and tongues for their dishonesty. The rebel duo boarded the ''Falcon''&mdash;which they had taken on their journey&mdash;and blasted away from the planet. Skywalker, angry with Solo's recklessness with credits that weren't theirs, voiced that they could get kicked out of the Rebellion for losing several thousand Rebel-owned credits. At Solo's retort that he needed to get the price off his head as soon as possible, Skywalker revealed that he, too, had an Imperial bounty of 60,000 credits on his head. Solo was distraught&mdash;Solo's bounty<ref name="Star Wars 16" /> was a mere 50,000 credits.<ref name="Star Wars 1" /> Solo intended to make back the rebel's credits and more the best way he knew how with Skywalker at his side: smuggling contraband.<ref name="Star Wars 16" />

With his new first mate, Solo traveled to Nar Shaddaa aboard the ''Falcon''. However, due to Solo being banned for cheating at sabacc at [[Unidentified criminal establishment (Nar Shaddaa)|the establishment]] where he intended to obtain something to smuggler&mdash;and Solo wanted to work on repairing his ship's ailing hyperdrive, let alone teach Skywalker the skills of a galactic smuggler&mdash;he sent the Jedi-in-training in his stead. Shortly thereafter, Skywalker returned to Solo and the ''Falcon'' and informed Solo that he had acquired a job from a [[Unidentified Twi'lek (Nar Shaddaa)|blue-skinned Twi'lek]]&mdash;though at only 5,000 credits, it was half the credits Solo had hoped for. Solo had expected an easy shipment, but he got more than he bargained for when the cargo was revealed to be an entire herd of large, pungent [[nerf]]s. So many, in fact, that they filled up Solo's prized ship all the way into the cockpit, crowding the two rebels as they piloted the freighter towards their destination: the backwater planet [[Ibaar]].<ref name="Star Wars 17">''[[Star Wars 17: Rebel Jail, Part II]]''</ref>

[[File:You got a lot of nerfs.jpg|thumb|left|234x234px|Solo berates Skywalker wile piloting his ship under a herd of nerfs]]
En route to Ibaar, the nerfs shed lots of [[Hair|fur]] and made "messes" around Solo's ship. As a result of the nerf's unruliness Solo who told Skywalker that for only managing half the credits they needed, and for the unruly cargo of nerfs, that Skywalker was "dead" to him. A minute later, a trio of Imperial TIE fighters appeared and ordered the ''Falcon{{'}}s'' crew to halt and allow the Imperials to board the ship because they believed the Corellian YT-1300 light freighter to be transporting illegal livestock that was on its way to an Imperial world that the Empire believed to be sympathetic to the Rebel Alliance. Infuriated, Solo refused, but with their hyperdrive out of commission, Solo worked his way through the situation&mdash;all the while urging Skywalker to control the un-space-worthy nerfs.<ref name="Star Wars 17" />

Skywalker then shot down the three pursuing Imperial fighters, allowing Solo to land safely on the mountainous Ibaar, where the herd of livestock was unloaded by a pair of [[nerf herder]]s. While the shephards did their work, Skywalker begged Solo to allow him to man the pilot's seat of the ''Falcon'' as a sort of right of passage for Solo's idea to make the Jedi farm boy into a smuggler. Solo refused and retorted that Skywalker had proven himself to be a poor smuggler by failing to make a profit on their cargo job to Ibaar, and told him that he was going to have to thoroughly clean the ''Falcon'' or Chewbacca would be angry with them both. But Skywalker threatened to inform Princess Organa that Solo had gambled with the Alliance's credits, and Solo begrudgingly let Skywalker fly his ship. While doing so, Skywalker quipped that he felt the ''Falcon'' was sluggish, which offended Solo and he quickly took the controls back from the Skywalker. After receiving a distress message from Sana Starros, Solo and Skywalker made tracks to Sunspot Prison in order to rendezvous with Organa and Starros there.<ref name="Star Wars 18">''[[Star Wars 18: Rebel Jail, Part III]]''</ref>

[[File:Eneb Ray holds rebels hostage on Sunspot Prison.jpg|thumb|right|263x263px|Eneb Ray threatens to kill Solo and Skywalker if Organa doesn't agree to his demands]]
Upon arriving at the prison space station,<ref name="Star Wars 18" /> however, [[Eneb Ray]], former Rebel spy and insurgent, covertly knocked the Solo and Skywalker out, tied them to the ''Falcon's'' landing gear, placed [[bandolier]]s of thermal detonators around their necks and used them as hostages while he revealed his identity to Organa, Starros, and Aphra&mdash;who had made a temporary truce with the two other women in order to repel the [[Assault on Sunspot Prison|attack]] by [[Eneb Ray's forces|Ray's forces]]. Shortly thereafter, Organa, Starros and Doctor Aphra&mdash;whom had come to a temporary truce with the other women in order to repel Ray's attack&mdash;arrested Ray after disorienting him by disabling the prison's [[artificial gravity]], which also awoke Solo and Skywalker. The two rebels were then freed and a portion of the Alliance fleet arrived and began the evacuation of Sunspot Prison. The smuggler then made sure Skywalker wouldn't tell Organa of his mishap with the Alliance's funds, and the rebels abandoned the space-bound prison.<ref name="Star Wars 19">''[[Star Wars 19: Rebel Jail, Part IV]]''</ref>

====The ''Harbinger''====
Later, Han Solo assisted the Rebellion in stealing the Imperial Star Destroyer ''[[Harbinger (Imperial I-class)|Harbinger]]'' as part of a mission to [[Siege on Tureen VII|assist]] the people of [[Tureen VII]]. During the operation, he raced Leia Organa to decide who would be the captain of the stolen ship. As they raced, [[Task Force 99]] infiltrated the ''Harbinger''. He piloted the ship while the incursion took place, and later used a thermal detonator on the bridge so that he and Leia could escape.<ref name="Star Wars Volume 4">''[[Star Wars Vol. 4: Last Flight of the Harbinger]]''</ref> The two of the them, using [[Breath mask/Canon|Breath masks]],  were able to board the ''Falcon'' and escape before the ''Harbinger'' crashed.<ref name="Star Wars 25">''[[Star Wars 25: The Last Flight of the Harbinger, Part V]]''</ref> Solo later [[Escape from Skorii-Lei|rescued]] Leia from [[Skorii-Lei]] and gave her medical attention.

After wondering who did it, they found that it was SCAR Squadron. Luke convinced them to bury the bodies, and they did so with great sadness.<ref name="Star Wars 37">''[[Star Wars 37: Imperial Pride]]''</ref>

====The Screaming Citadel====
At the [[Horox III]] [[Horox III rebel outpost|rebel outpost]], Sol was told by [[S4]] that Luke went with Dr. [[Chelli Lona Aphra]].<ref name="Screaming Citadel 1">''[[The Screaming Citadel, Part I]]''</ref> Solo, along with Chewbacca, Starros, Leia and S4 took the ''Falcon'' to the [[Citadel of Ktath'atn|Citadel]] of [[Ktath'atn]]. Upon their arrival at Ktah'atn, Solo and the others met [[0-0-0]] and [[BT-1]].<ref name="Screaming Citadel 2">''[[Star Wars 31: The Screaming Citadel, Part II]]''</ref> They then met up with Skywalker and Aphra at the [[Ark Angel II|''Ark Angel II'']]. Sol told her that the ''Ark Angel''<nowiki/>'s aft thruster was misaligned. He  was then confronted by [[Varroa]] and several of the [[Unidentified Queen of Ktath'atn|Queen's]] guards. Solo and the others then hid behind a door. Inside the door were [[Abersyn symbiote]]s. Solo attempted to confront the Queen but was hypnotized.<ref name="Screaming Citadel 3">''[[Doctor Aphra 7: The Screaming Citadel, Part III]]''</ref>

Solo was taken to the queen's chamber where one of the symbiotes stung him in the neck. He was then forced to drink something that forced him to serve the queen. Solo was given armor and forced to track down Leia and Staros. Solo and the guards cornered Leia. He attempted to use a symbiote on her but was stopped when Starros and Aprha's droids arrived.<ref name="Screaming Citadel 4">''[[Star Wars 32: The Screaming Citadel, Part IV]]''</ref> Solo attempted to shoot Leia and Staros, but Leia was able to convince him and the guards to lowere their weapons. Varroa attempted to reassert the hive's control over him, but Solo called in [[Black Krrsantan]]. Solo was able to take control of the other guards and killed Varroa. Solo was named King by the guards, but did not want to tell people what to do. He was able to disband the hive and free the people. Solo was then sedated by Triple-Zero. Solo, Staros, Skywalker and Leia left Ktahh'atn knowing that it was freed.<ref>[[Doctor Aphra 8: The Screaming Citadel, Part V|''Doctor Aphra 8: The Screaming Citadel, Part V'']]</ref>

====Escorting Grakkus====
{{Quote|You're risking your life to take me to jail, bu the irony is... ...You're the one who's truly in prison, Han Solo.|Grakkus|Star Wars 35: The Hutt Run}}
Solo was asked by Senator Mothma to take [[Grakkus]] to [[Akiva]] for interrogation and imprisonment by the Alliance. En route to Akiva, Solo threatened to shoot Grakkus if he tried anything against him or Chewie. Grakkus tried to convince Solo to free him and return to his life as smuggler. As Solo thought about Grakkus' offer,<ref name="Hutt Run">''[[Star Wars 35: The Hutt Run]]''</ref> the ''Falcon'' came under attack by three TIEs.<ref name="13 crates">''[[Star Wars 34: The Thirteen Crates]]''</ref>

Solo realized that Grakkus had disabled the hyperdrive. Solo attempted to evade the TIE patrol to no avail. He decided to contact the TIEs and surrender to them. Solo landed the ''Falcon'' on a asteroid where the three TIE pilots boarded the ship and met Grakkus. After Grakkus killed on of the pilots, Sol finished off the last two after hiding in the ''Falcon''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s secret compartments. Solo turned Grakkus' offer and decided to resume his voyage to Akiva. Upon hearing this, Grakkus grabbed Solo by the neck and and demanded that Chewie take him to [[Teth]], where his [[Grakkus' safe house|safe house]] was. Upon confirming it, Solo shocked Grakkus and sent the information to General Draven. Solo told Grakkus that it was all a set up to get his safehouse's location. After X-wings arrived, Solo knocked Grakkus out and took him to prisonh.<ref name="Hutt Run" />

====Trouble on Odona====
[[File:UnidentifiedcreatureOdona.jpg|thumb|left|205x205px|A creature attacks Han and Leia.]]
Solo took Leia to [[Odona]] to see if it was a viable location for a new rebel base. However, they got lost in a serieve of caves for three days and were attacked by a [[Unidentified creature (Odona)|creature]]. Unbeknownst to Solo or Leia, they were tracked and followed by [[Frax]], [[Selt]], and a [[droid]]. Solo came under fire and took Leia to cover. He then told Leia to get to the ''Falcon''. Solo returned to the caves and was confronted by Frax, who wanted revenge against Solo for dropping him into the [[Cordaxian sea]] and to be captured by the Empire. Solo tried to run, but was stopped by Frax and bounty hunters. However, Leia was able to light the droid on fire
[[File:Han and Leia go back to Falcon.JPG|thumb|right|255x255px|Han and Leia make their way back to the ''Millennium Falcon''.]]
and escape Frax. As Solo and Leia made their way back to the ''Falcon'', they were confronted by Frax who attempted to shoot him despite Leia's threat to shoot him. Despite missing Frax, Leia was able to cause ice to come at him and freeze him to death. Solo and Leia were found by Chewie and taken to the Rebel fleet to recover.<ref name="Annual 3" />

Later Solo took Leia and Luke to the rebel [[Horox III rebel outpost|outpost]] on [[Horox III]]. There, they see bodies and debris left behind after a Imperial [[Mission to Horox III|attack]]. Solo told leia they had to leave the bodies. They then saw a message left by the [[SCAR trooper]]s of [[Task Force 99]]. Solo helped put the bodies into a pile and give them a funeral pyre.<ref name="Star Wars 37">''[[Star Wars 37: Imperial Pride]]''</ref>

====Fighting with the Partisans====
Solo, along with Leia and Skywalker went to [[Jedha]]. There, they [[Mission to Jedha|met]] and rescued [[Chulco Gi]] and former [[Alliance Special Forces]] soldier and  [[Partisans|Partisan]] [[Ubin Des]]. After escaping the Imperial snowstrooper patrol, Solo took the ''Falcon'' to [[NaJedha]] so Leia could speak with Des about a meeting with the surviving Partisans Solo allowed himself to be blindfolded and let Des and Gi to fly the Falcon to the new Partisan base. Solo and the other were brought before [[Benthic]].<ref name="Star Wars 38">''[[Star Wars 38: The Ashes of Jedha, Part I]]''</ref> Solo told Benthic to either kill him or show them the Partisans' famous decisiveness. Benthic freed them and spoke with Leia, Solo, and Skywalker about destroying the [[Drill citadel]].<ref name="Star Wars 39">''[[Star Wars 39: The Ashes of Jedha, Part II]]''</ref>

As the partisans attacked the drill citadel. Solo and Leia flew the ''Falcon'' towards the drill. Solo was able to destroy the citadel and return to the Partisans' base.<ref name="Star Wars 40">[[Star Wars 40: The Ashes of Jedha, Part III|''Star Wars 40: The Ashes of Jedha, Part III'']]</ref> The Empire then deployed the ''Leviathan''. Solo, Leia, and Benthic looked at the ''Leviathan'' and saw no explosive that could damage it. After Des' explosives failed to make a dent in the ''Leviathan'', Solo flew a [[T-47 airspeeder|airspeeder]] with Leia as his gunner. Together they rescued Des and her team from the ''Leviathan''<nowiki/>'s tracks. Solo chastised Des for making a suiced run and told her not to do it unless there's no other choice. Solo was then informed Chewbacca was coming to help them finish off the ''Leviathan''. Solo met up with Chewie at the base after Skywalker rescued him with information from Shu-Torun.<ref name="Star Wars 41">[[Star Wars 41: The Ashes of Jedha, Part IV|''Star Wars 41: The Ashes of Jedha, Part IV'']]</ref>

With the Patisans, Solo and the others made a plan to attack the ''Leviathan'' using the plans Chewie acquired. Solo agreed to fly the mission and keep an eye on the partisans. As the partisans boarded the ''Falcon'', Solo and the others came under attack by stormtroopers. Benthic was wounded and Solo told partisans to get aboard the ''Falcon'' to escape. As the ''Falcon'' made it's escape, Solo did not believe that Des should be leading the mission. Solo was reluctant to take the lead, but was convinced by Chewie to take charge since he was the ''Falcon''<nowiki/>'s captain. Solo saw that the ''Leviathan''<nowiki/>'s guns sere down and lead the partisans in attacking the stormtroopers stationed there.<ref name="Star Wars 42">[[Star Wars 42: The Ashes of Jedha, Part V|''Star Wars 42: The Ashes of Jedha, Part V'']]</ref>

Solo and the Partisans were able to make their way to the bridge. On the bridge, Solo, Leia, Des and the partisans were able to pilot the ''Leviathan'' into Jedha City's crater. Solo ordered the Partisans to barricade the bridge to prevent the Empire from stopping their plans. Solo and the Partisans were able to return to the ''Falocon'' before it fell into the crater. Solo took the partisans back to NaJedha. Benthic told Solo that he and his fellow partisans would guard Jedha's ashes unitl it's gone. Before leaving, Solo awarded Des the [[Medal of Bravery]] for her actions, even though it was a copy.<ref name="Star Wars 43">[[Star Wars 43: The Ashes of Jedha, Part VI|''Star Wars 43: The Ashes of Jedha, Part VI'']]</ref>

====Mutiny on Mon Cala====
Solo took Admiral [[Gial Ackbar]], Skywalker and Leia to Mon Cala. There, they met with Mon Cala's [[Regent]], [[Grand Admiral]] [[Urtya]]. There, Ackabar and Leia asked Urtya for the [[Mon Cala Mercantile Fleet]] to become part of the Rebel Alliance's fleet. Solo spotted a [[LAAT/le gunship|patrol transport]] approaching their position and came under attack. The transport landed and Solo approached the troopers. Solo was able to bribe the sergeant and toss a detonator into the transport. Solo called out to Chewie to bring up the boat so they could escape. Solo drove the boat past several creatures. Unfortunately, Urtya refused to give the Alliance the fleet and Solo took Leia and Ackbar back to the [[Mako-Ta Space Docks]]. There, he gave Skywaker a drink.<ref name="Star Wars 44">''[[Star Wars 44: Mutiny at Mon Cala, Part I]]''</ref> In the mess hall, they met up with [[Wedge Antilles]], [[Derek Klivian|"Hobbie" Klivian]], and [[Zev Senesca]]. Together, they commemorated the fallen pilots of [[Red Squadron (Galactic Alliance)|Red Squadron]]. <ref name="Star Wars 45">''[[Star Wars 45: Mutiny at Mon Cala, Part II]]''</ref>
Leia arrived in the hall with a mission. With Skywalker and Chewie, Solo went with Leia to [[Dex Acquisitions Depot]] on [[Meor Ain]]. Together they broke into the Depot's ultra security brig and took the [[Clawdite]] [[Tunga Arpagion]] with them<ref name="Star Wars 45" /> aboard the ''Falcon''. Solo and the others were able to convince him to pose as [[Moff]] [[Tan Hubi]] while they use him to free King [[Lee-Char]]. With Skywalker, Solo and Chewie were able to infiltrate the [[Moncaladrome]] through the [[Refresher]]. Posing as a attendant, Solo was able bluff his way past a officer by allowing her to dry her hands on Chewie. Solo was then given a tip, much to Chewie's chagrin. They were able to take Moff Hubi and switch him with Tunga.<ref name="Star Wars 46">''[[Star Wars 46: Mutiny at Mon Cala, Part III]]''</ref>

Solo flew a [[Submarine]] to [[Strokill Prime]] to rescue Lee-Char. Chewie was able to use Hubi's bio-signature to get past Strokill Prime's defenses, in addition to codes provided by Queen Trios.<ref name="Star Wars 46" /> Solo flew the submarine past a [[ Opee sea killer|monstrous fish]]. Solo watched as Skywalker allowed the fish to swallow him. After Chewie rescued Skywalker from the fish, Solo took the submarine to the [[Unidentified Imperial base (Strokill Prime)|Imperial base]] and docked inside of it. Solo and Leia stunned several of the guards. Unfortunately, they discovered that the King was on life-support and could not be moved.<ref name="Star Wars 47">''[[Star Wars 47: Mutiny at Mon Cala, Part IV]]''</ref>

Solo and Skywalker argued about their next move. Solo and Skywalker searched for recording droid so Leia could deliver Lee-Char's words to his people. Solo was able to find one and recorded Lee-Char's speech. After the guards killed Lee-Char, Solo and the others returned to the submarine to escape. On Mon Cala, Solo and the others met up with 3PO and [[Tunga Arpagion]]. They were confronted by Grand Admiral Urtya and several of his people who demanded Lee-Char's recording. After Urtya stunned Leia, Solo allowed him to take Lee-Char's recording. As Solo flew the ''Falcon'' away from Mon Cala, they were joined by the Mercantile fleet and a pair of star destroyers.<ref>[[Star Wars 48: Mutiny at Mon Cala, Part V|''Star Wars 48: Mutiny at Mon Cala, Part V'']]</ref>

As the Empire sent in bombers to destroy the ''Falcon'' and the Mercantile fleet, Solo was contacted by Urtya who agreed to rebel against the Empire. They were then joined by the Rebel Alliance fleet under Ackbar, that would protect the fleet. Solo told Leia to get into one of the ''Falcon''<nowiki/>'s turrets and destroy the bombers. Solo saw that the Empire was targeting the Mon Calamari's escape pods and took the ''Falcon'' to stop several TIES before they could destroy the pods. After the ''Aurora Flare'' blew up and destroyed one of the star destroyers, Solo had the ''Falcon'' jump into hyperspace and escape with both the Rebel Alliance fleet and the mercantile fleet. Solo dropped Tunga off at the [[Cosmatanic Steppes]].<ref>[[Star Wars 49: Mutiny at Mon Cala, Part VI|''Star Wars 49: Mutiny at Mon Cala, Part VI'']]</ref>

====Escape from the Mako-Ta Space Docks====
At the same time as a Rebel party to celebrate the expanded Rebel fleet at the [[Mako-Ta Space Docks]], Solo, Chewie and 3PO went to the [[Ring of Kafrene]] to meet with a [[Alaphani]] in a bar for a deal for a set of [[Transponder code/Canon|transponder codes]]. C-3PO translated the [[Alaphani (language)|Alaphani language]] for Solo and the deal went well. During the closing phases of the deal Solo breiefly joked about giving C-3PO over to the Alaphani for 10 percent off. 3PO was concerned by this, but Solo explained he was joking and that no Alaphani would accept that deal. Chewie then approached 3PO and Solo to alert them that two of Jabba the Hutt‚Äôs bounty hunters were present in the bar. After hearing this Solo finished the deal and the trio quickly left. The two bounty hunters followed, but Solo and Chewbacca hide behind their field of view to surprise them. Solo has C-3PO take the bounty hunters weapons, and as the trio ran back to the ''Falcon'' Solo yelled back and promised that Jabba would get his money.<ref name="Star Wars 50">''[[Star Wars 50: Hope Dies, Part I]]''</ref>

3PO put the bounty hunters weapons on the table onboard, and Solo assured Chewbacca that they were not missing the party. He then explained to his partner that he had a contact who would pay them week for the set of codes. As the ''Falcon'' Chewie reminded Solo that Luke Skywalker had a role at the party, as him and other X-wing pilots were planned to do a flyby for the gathered rebel allies. Solo admitted he would have liked to see it as well, and the ''Falcon'' left for the [[Space Dock/Canon|Space Docks]].<ref name="Star Wars 50" /> Solo arrived at the docks and found the Rebel fleet under attack by the Empire's [[Death Squadron]]. Leia told that Queen Trios had betrayed them and disabled all the cruisers and their hangar bays. Leia told Solo into a bay door in order to open it. Solo, despite his better judgment, took the ''Falcon'' close to star destroyer and several TIEs following him as he made a run towards one of the cruisers. The ''Falcon'' then came under attack by Lord Vader in his [[Darth Vader's TIE Advanced|TIE Advanced]].<ref name="Star Wars 51">''[[Star Wars 51: Hope Dies, Part II]]''</ref>

Solo was able to evade Vader while Chewie tried to shoot him down. Solo flew the ''Falcon'' towards a [[Lajaie's cruiser|cruiser]] as Vader fired several missiles at him. However, Vader was able to force the ''Falcon'' away from cruiser's hangar doors. After commander [[Lajaie]] cruiser was destroyed, Solo decided to send a messenger to Leia by sending 3PO by a escape pod. Solo flew the ''Falcon'' through the cruiser's debris hoping Vader would not follow him. Chewie was able to launch 3PO to land on the [[Republic (MC80a star cruiser)|''Republic'']].<ref name="Star Wars 52">''[[Star Wars 52: Hope Dies, Part III]]</ref> Solo recieved helped from Skywalker's newly formed [[Rogue Squadron]]. Solo lead the squadron in taking out the TIEs.<ref name="Star Wars 53">''[[Star Wars 53: Hope Dies, Part IV]]''</ref>

Solo was forced to land othe ''Falcon'' on Ackbar's cruiser after taking heavy damage from Vader.<ref name="Star Wars 53" /> He then took a [[Flight suit]] and took an X-wing and rejoined the fight. Solo and Skywalker came across a TIE that was acting weird and realized that a ally was aboard. Solo and skywalker lead the TIE back to the cruiser. There, they learned that Leia was the pilot and got her to the ''Repulic'''s bridge. The ''Republic'' was able to make it's escape into hyperspace.<ref name="Star Wars 54">''[[Star Wars 54: Hope Dies, Part V]]''</ref> Solo, Skywalker and the rest of Rogue Squadron returned to help the surviving cruisers. Solo defended Leia and Skywalker's ship as they boarded the base to rescue Mothma and the other ambassadors. During the retreat, Solo and R2's X-wing was damages but was rescued by a rebel [[Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier|''Quasar Fire''-class carrier]].<ref name="Star Wars 55">[[Star Wars 55: Hope Dies, Part VI|''Star Wars 55: Hope Dies, Part VI'']]</ref>

As the carrier went into hyperspace, it engines were fried and cruiser had to land on [[Corosi 7]]. Solo was unable to contact Ackbar or Chewie due to keeping the Rebel fleet hidden through out the outer rim. Despite that, Solo was then given a promotion to Colonel by Mothma, though he refuse it. Solo then came up with plan to find Chewie and the ''Falcon''. Solo took Leia and Skywalker to Nar Shadaa to meet with Starros, who agreed to help them.<ref name="Star Wars 55" />

====Rebel duty in the snow of Hoth====
[[File:Han Threepio R2 Chewie Falcon in Echo base.jpg|thumb|left|277x277px|Solo converses with Threepio while repairing the ''Falcon'' alongside Chewie in Echo Base]]
Over three years after the Death Star's destruction at Skywalker's hand at the Battle of Yavin, the Alliance established a new base in the [[Anoat sector]] on the ice planet [[Hoth]], far from the Empire's reach.<ref name="Echo Base Databank">{{Databank|echo-base|Echo Base|archivedate=20170815093058}}</ref> The base was aptly designated as [[Echo Base]], as it was carved into the rocky caverns of the [[Clabburn Range]] of mountains. Within months of the new base being established, Solo, Organa, Skywalker, and the others of Organa's team were deployed by Rebel High Command to Hoth aboard the ''Falcon''.<ref name="Episode V Episode Guide">{{SW|url=films/star-wars-episode-v-the-empire-strikes-back|text=''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'' Episode Guide}}</ref> Solo and Skywalker scouted out the land around the base on regular recon missions as a part of their duties, using reptilian [[tauntaun]]s as mounts to better traverse the freezing landscape.<ref name="Absolutely Everything to Know">''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know]]''</ref>

One day, Solo worked on repairs on the ''Falcon'' in Echo Base's main hangar when a young rebel soldier who looked like he'd been through a beating walked under Solo's ship lugging a canister of [[bacta]]. Curious, Solo asked the rebel what had happened to him. The trooper, [[First Sergeant]] [[Hazram Namir]] of the [[Sixty-First Mobile Infantry]] cynically replied that he had gotten into a fist fight with an overzealous and patriotic member of the [[Alliance Special Forces]]. Solo just smiled and went back to his work. Later that evening, Namir&mdash;though Solo never got the man's name, and Solo never gave his&mdash;boarded the ''Falcon'' with a bin of mechanical parts with orders to give them to Solo on behalf of the Alliance deck crew. Solo began installing the parts, and asked Namir who he had gotten into a fight with, to which Namir told him he had fought a man named [[Kryndal]]. Namir assisted Solo in repairing the ''Falcon'' for over thirty minutes, and when they finished&mdash;or Solo maybe just gave up&mdash;Solo produced a bottle of [[Corellian whiskey]] and the two shared several drinks while Namir explained how he had ended up on cargo duty, and Solo how the YT-1300 freighter had been damaged. Solo identified with Namir, so he admitted that he was something like a mercenary, and hadn't joined the Rebellion because he believed in their cause. Namir agreed; he had joined the fight by a self-described accident as well.<ref name="Twilight Company">''[[Battlefront: Twilight Company]]''</ref>

Time went on and Solo and Namir continued their personal discussions of beliefs and morals. Solo expressed his worriment with the future state of galactic government&mdash;if the Alliance eventually conquered the Empire as they so hoped, men like Solo and Namir, who didn't believe in the Rebellion's cause, would be shunted once smugglers and mercenaries weren't required for the Alliance to operate. Namir wholeheartedly agreed, and secretly hoped the Galactic Civil War would go on forever. Solo took one last sip of the [[whiskey]], handed the bottle to Namir, and continued on with the repairs. Namir, too, went back on his business.<ref name="Twilight Company" />

[[File:Hera Han Leia Tauntauns on Hoth.png|thumb|right|288x288px|Solo, Syndulla, and Organa scout the frigid plains of Hoth for the lost Rebel ship]]
Solo took well to mounting and riding the unruly tauntauns and was sent on a reconnaissance mission in order to locate a [[Unidentified lost Rebel starship|lost ship]] which had gone missing a month before during snow storm. The deflector shield which protected Echo base from Imperial attack had been damaged and made inoperable and the equipment aboard the lost ship was needed to repair the shield's generator. At dawn, Solo, Organa, and the rebel veteran Twi'lek General [[Hera Syndulla]] ventured out into the frigid mountains in search of the lost ship. Throughout the day, however, Solo and Syndulla mastered tauntaun riding, while Organa had trouble controlling her beast and&mdash;to Solo's amusement&mdash;was de-[[saddle]]d. While Solo helped the Princess re-mount her tauntaun, he informed the search team that night was fast approaching and they would soon have to return to Echo Base empty handed. For her part, Organa insisted they couldn't return without first finding the lost ship. As she spoke, Organa again lost control of her tauntaun and stumbled backwards and fell from a steep embankment into a pit. Panicked, Solo and Syndualla rushed to the cliff edge and were relieved to see the princess unharmed, having literally stumbled across the lost Rebel ship at the bottom of the pit. Solo and Syndulla made their way safely to the bottom of the pit, discovering arriving at Organa's position minutes later, and learned that Organa had found the equipment that could be used to repair the shield generator, and had fought off a massive carnivorous [[wampa]]. The trio then returned to Echo Base victorious.<ref name="Forces of Destiny Leia">''[[Star Wars: Forces of Destiny‚ÄîLeia]]''</ref>

Afterwards, the Rebels relocated to Echo Base on Hoth. Solo, meanwhile, ran into a bounty hunter on [[Ord Mantell]], convincing him to leave and fulfill his debt to Jabba, so he began repairing the ''Falcon'' on Hoth. Believing himself to be leaving, he had a heated conversation with Leia, claiming that she felt romantic feelings towards him. After this debate, Solo learned Luke had gone missing on patrol. Riding out on a tauntaun in the midst of snowstorm, Han found Luke had been attacked by a wampa. After the tauntaun collapsed and died from the cold, Han used Luke's [[lightsaber]] to cut the animal open and placed him inside to prevent him from freezing to death. After bringing Luke back to recover from his injuries, Han and Chewbacca went out to investigate a signal and encountered an [[Viper probe droid|Imperial probe droid]]. Realizing the Empire had discovered their location, the Rebels decided to evacuate. During the ensuing [[Battle of Hoth|battle]], Han rescued Leia from the collapsed command center, leading her towards her transport. A tunnel collapse cut of their way there, so Han, Chewie, Leia, and C-3PO escaped on the still unrepaired ''Falcon''.<ref name="SW:ESB">[[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']]</ref>

====On the run from the Empire====
{{Quote|What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid field?''"<br />"''They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?|Princess Leia Organa and Han Solo|Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}
[[File:Hanleiafalcon.png|thumb|left|275x275px|Han and Leia share a kiss aboard the ''Millennium Falcon.'']]
In space, the ''Falcon'' was pursued by several Star Destroyers and TIE fighters. While Solo was working on repairs, the ship drifted into an [[Hoth asteroid belt|asteroid field]]. Claiming that the Imperials would be "crazy" to follow them, Solo flew into the asteroid field, which would cause extensive damage to the pursuing Imperial Fleet. After the immediately pursuing TIE fighters were destroyed by asteroids, Solo landed the ''Falcon'' in a cave on a large asteroid, where he continued to work on repairs. While repairing the ''Falcon'', Han and Leia fell in love, sharing a kiss before being interrupted by C-3PO.<ref name="SW:ESB" />

Inside the cave, Leia saw something outside of the ship, so she, Han, and Chewbacca went outside to investigate. Discovering that [[mynock]]s were the cause, Chewbacca accidentally fired a shot into the cave, which caused a tremor. Solo realized something wasn't right, he fired his blaster into the ground, causing another tremor. The three returned into the ''Falcon'', flying out of the cave, which they discovered was actually the inside of an [[exogorth]] slug. Fleeing back towards the Imperials, Solo flew straight towards the bridge of the Star Destroyer ''Avenger'', then hiding on the back of the bridge. The ruse worked, with the Imperials unable to find the ship. Preparing to spread about the galaxy to search for the Falcon, the Imperial fleet dumped their trash, and Solo detached the ''Falcon'', which floated off with the rest of the trash. Solo then decided to go to [[Cloud City]], a [[tibanna]] gas mine on [[Bespin]] run by his old friend Lando Calrissian. Unknown to the rebels, however, Boba Fett had also hid his ship, the ''[[Slave I]]'', among the Empire's trash, and followed them to Cloud City.<ref name="SW:ESB" />

====Imprisonment in Carbonite====
{{Quote|I love you."<br />"I know.|Leia Organa and Han Solo|Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}
[[File:Hansolo10.jpg|right|thumb|248x248px|Solo greets Lando Calrissian on Cloud City]]
On Cloud City, Han met his old friend Lando Calrissian, who despite showing initial hostility, embraced his old friend. Calrissian provided the rebels with lodging and promised to repair the Falcon. While Han said he didn't trust Lando, due to his knowledge of Calrissian being a scoundrel, he appeared to be at ease in Cloud City, while Leia felt suspicious due to C-3PO going missing and then reappearing in pieces. Calrissian then invited Solo, Organa and Chewbacca for refreshments, and told them about a deal that would keep the Empire out of Cloud City. To Solo's surprise, he led them into a room with Darth Vader. Solo immediately drew his blaster and fired several shots at the Sith Lord, but Vader blocked the shots and pulled the blaster out of Solo's hands with the Force.

Solo was then tortured by the Empire, but he claimed they didn't even ask him any questions. When placed in a cell, Calrissian arrived and told the prisoners that Solo would be handed over to Fett, who would take him to Jabba, and that they were a trap set by Vader for Han and Leia's friend Luke Skywalker. Angrily, Solo attacked his "friend", but was restrained.<ref name="SW:ESB" />

Vader planned to take Skywalker to his master, [[Galactic Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]], by encasing him in [[carbonite]]. Unsure if a human could survive the process, he was to test it on Solo. Tearfully, Leia confessed her love to Han, to which he simply replied that he knew. Leia, Chewbacca, Calrissian, Fett, and Vader looked on as Han was lowered into the carbon freezing chamber and frozen. He survived the freezing process and fell into hibernation. He was then handed over to Fett and loaded onto ''Slave I''.<ref name="SW:ESB" /> Despite a rescue attempt by Leia, Lando, and Chewie, Fett escaped Cloud City and brought Han to Jabba the Hutt, who kept his encased body as a trophy.<ref name="SW:ESB" />

====Rescue from Jabba====
{{Quote|Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas.''"<br />"''Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. Right?|C-3PO, translating for Jabba the Hutt, and Han Solo|Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi}}
[[File:Hibernation sickness.png|thumb|left|245x245px|Han freed from the carbonite by Leia.]]
Several months later, Solo was released from the carbonite by Leia, disguised as the bounty hunter [[Boushh]]. Due to hibernation sickness, Solo had temporarily become blind, but recognized Jabba's laugh when he revealed himself to be watching the rescue. Solo was then placed in a prison cell with his partner Chewbacca, while Leia was taken as a personal slave by Jabba. After Leia was captured, Luke Skywalker arrived, and faced off against Jabba's prized [[Rancor]], killing it. In rage, Jabba sentenced Skywalker, Solo and the Wookiee to be fed to the [[sarlacc]] in the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]].<ref name="Episode VI" />

At the Pit, Jabba offered the prisoners one last chance to plea for mercy, to which Solo replied that Jabba would receive no such pleasure from them. Skywalker then offered Jabba one last chance to free them, which he denied. R2-D2 then released Luke's [[Luke Skywalker's green lightsaber|lightsaber]], who caught it and began a battle. In the ensuing struggle, Han was still mostly blind, lending him unable to contribute much. However, after being told by Chewbacca that Boba Fett had joined the battle, Han unintentionally swung an axe into Fett's jetpack, sending him flying into Jabba's sail barge and then rolling into the Sarlacc. After a blaster shot knocked Lando, disguised as a palace guard, off of the skiff they were on, Han lowered the axe down for Lando to grab, but Calrissian's foot was caught by one of the sarlacc's tentacles. Claiming his vision had "gotten a lot better," Han shot the tentacle and pulled Lando back up into the skiff. Luke then rescued Leia, Artoo, and Threepio from the sail barge and destroyed it, and the rebels escaped.<ref name="Episode VI" />

====At the Battle of Endor====
{{Quote|I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew."<br />"He wasn't. I can feel it.|Han Solo and Leia Organa shortly after the Battle of Endor.|Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi}}
[[File:HanEndor.jpg|right|thumb|230x230px|Solo on Endor]]
After being rescued, Han joined the Alliance and was given the rank of General. As part of the attack on the [[Death Star II|Second Death Star]], with Skywalker, Organa, and Chewbacca, Han commandeered the ''[[Tydirium]]'', a captured Imperial shuttle, and took a Rebel strike team to the forest moon of Endor to disable the shields protecting the superweapon. Shortly after landing on the forest moon, the strike team encountered a group of [[scout trooper]]s. Solo attempted to sneak up on them, but failed to do so, alerting them and allowing two to escape. Luke and Leia hopped on a speeder to pursue them, leaving Solo and the rest of the strike team behind.<ref name="Episode VI" />

Luke eventually made his way back to the rest of the Rebels, without information on Leia. Luke, Han, Chewie, Artoo, and Threepio set off to find Leia, while Han sent the rest of the strike team to move towards the shield generator. While looking, they group was captured by [[Ewok]]s. The furry tribesmen believed C-3PO to be a god, and attempted to cook the others at a banquet in his honor. However, Luke used the force to levitate the "god" in a demonstration of his "magic," frightening the Ewoks into releasing the others. At the village, the Rebels found Leia, and C-3PO managed to befriend the Ewoks. Luke then left the other rebels to confront his father, Darth Vader.<ref name="Episode VI" />

[[File:Han and Leia on Endor.png|thumb|239x239px|left|Solo with Leia Organa after the Battle of Endor]]
The next day, Solo's group met up with the main Rebel strike team at the shield generator, but Ewok scouts informed them of a less-guarded rear entrance. After three of the four guards were distracted by the Ewok [[Paploo]], the Rebels neutralized the last guard and entered the shield bunker. But the operation proved to be a trap, and Solo and the Rebels were captured. However, the Empire had not expected the Ewoks to attack, which allowed the Rebels to escape. For most of the battle, Han stayed at the door, trying to open it. After R2-D2 was damaged after attempting to open it, Han unsuccessfully tried to hotwire the door open. He then impersonated the pilot of an AT-ST that had been captured by Chewbacca and two Ewoks, getting the Imperials to open the doors. Han was then able to place detonators inside the shield generator, destroying it and leaving the Death Star vulnerable to attack. Han and Leia witnessed the Death Star's destruction, and she revealed to him that Luke was her brother. Solo participated with the other Rebels and Ewoks in the victory celebration held that night.<ref name="Episode VI" />

Following the battle, Solo, Chewbacca and R2-D2 were sent by Organa to General Syndulla's [[Syndulla's camp|camp]] to obtain food rations for the Ewoks as a mean to keep the furry creatures from making a meal out of the captured stormtroopers. While at Syndulla's camp, Syndulla forced Solo to admit that her ship the ''[[Ghost]]'' was superior ship to the ''Falcon'' in order to get the rations.<ref name="AIF">{{FOD|An Imperial Feast}}</ref>

====Shattering the Empire====
{{Quote|Seems no one told them they lost. The Ewoks did us a good turn, and General Madine feels&mdash;and I agree&mdash;that it would be rude to leave a company of bucketheads in their backyard. So we're going to finish this, once and for all.|Han Solo on the Imperial remnant on Endor|Shattered Empire, Part I}}
The morning after the Battle of Endor, General Solo led the Pathfinders on an [[Assault on an Imperial outpost|assault]] on an [[Imperial outpost (Endor)|Imperial outpost]] on the far side of Endor. Knowing that the Imperial outpost was preparing for a counter-attack, the rebel commanders dispatched Han Solo on a mission to destroy the base. Han outlined a plan for the Pathfinders and their Ewok allies to strike the outpost with limited air cover. During the assault, the rebel pilot Lieutenant [[Shara Bey]] served as the transport's pilot. The Pathfinders quickly wiped out the garrison and Solo uncovered a lot of data in the outpost's computers, which led him to conclude that the war was not over.<ref name="Shattered Empire 1" /> During their time on Endor, Han and Leia were [[Wedding of Han Solo and Leia Organa|married]], their ceremony was attended by only people they trusted.<ref name="Life Debt">''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]''</ref> As a wedding gift to his wife, Solo reconfigured some of the crew quarters on the ''Falcon'' to include a galley.<ref name="Cross">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: Incredible Cross-Sections]]''</ref>

Later, Solo, C-3PO, and the Pathfinders participated in a [[Raid at the Wretch of Tayron|raid]] on an ISB black-site at the [[Wretch of Tayron|Wretch]] of [[Tayron]]. During the assault, the Pathfinders managed to down an AT-ST walker which caused a breach in the facility's hall. This allowed Solo and his men to enter the base and secure the computers before the [[Unidentified Imperial base commander|base commander]] could initiate a purge of the computers. With the aid of C-3PO, the Pathfinders were able to hack into the Imperial data files and discovered that the Empire had begun to execute [[Operation: Cinder]], a posthumous order issued by the Emperor to devastate several worlds including [[Naboo]] as retribution for his demise.<ref name="Shattered Empire 3">''[[Shattered Empire, Part III]]''</ref> The Pathfinders' actions enabled the Rebel Alliance to deploy forces to halt Operation: Cinder, saving many lives and worlds.<ref name="Shattered Empire 4">''[[Shattered Empire, Part IV]]''</ref>

===New Republic===
====Honoring a life debt====
=====Gathering intelligence=====
[[File:HanSoloTakodana.png|thumb|right|267x267px|Solo talks to Maz Kanata on Takodana.]]
Several months after the Battle of Endor, Han arrived at [[Maz Kanata]]'s [[Maz Kanata's castle|castle]] on [[Takodana]] to rendezvous with an imperial defector named [[Ralsius Paldora]], who had stolen intelligence crucial to the liberation of Kashyyyk. The Empire had quickly discovered his treachery and followed him. Recovering the data cubes and fighting their way back to the ''Falcon'', Han and Ralsius were [[Skirmish on Takodana|saved]] by the arrival of [[Inferno Squad]], buying them time to escape the planet.<ref name="Battlefront 2">''[[Star Wars Battlefront II]]''</ref>

=====False leads=====
{{Quote|C'mon, Chewie. Set new coordinates. It's time to get you home.|Han Solo to Chewbacca, on the way to liberate Kashyyyk|Aftermath}}
Some time later, Han and Chewbacca received additional intelligence from the smuggler [[Imra]] that the Wookiee homeworld of [[Kashyyyk]] would have a decreased Imperial presence.<ref name="Aftermath" /> Against the advice of his wife Leia, the two friends gathered up several fellow smugglers and people who owed them favors for a [[Liberation of Kashyyyk|hastily-planned campaign to liberate]] the planet. However, this information turned out to be disinformation from the Empire to lure Han and his companions into a trap.<ref name="Life Debt" />

While Chewie attempted to board a gunship captained by the Wookiee [[pirate]] [[Kirratha]], they were attacked by two Star Destroyers and several TIE fighters. The Imperials disabled Kirratha's engines, leaving Chewie and Kirratha stranded in space. Han managed to escape but Chewbacca was captured and locked in an Imperial prison called [[Ashmead's Lock]]. While traveling through the edge of [[Wild Space]], Han contacted his wife Princess Leia to discuss the recent developments. However, he came under attack from Imperial forces and lost communication with Leia.<ref name="Life Debt" />

Princess Leia was unable to get help from the New Republic since they were preoccupied with fighting against the Galactic Empire. Since Han had resigned his commission as general in the [[New Republic military]], he was low on their list of priorities. Desperate, Leia turned to the New Republic starfighter pilot [[Norra Wexley]] for help. Norra and Captain [[Wedge Antilles]] traveled to Solo's last known coordinates in Wild Space but found themselves under attack by Imperial forces. After being rescued by the New Republic Starfleet, Norra resigned her commission in the Starfleet to find Solo out of respect for Princess Leia.<ref name="Life Debt" />

=====Finding new allies=====
Norra, her son [[Temmin Wexley]], his battle droid [[Mister Bones]], the [[Zabrak]] bounty hunter [[Jas Emari]], the former Imperial [[loyalty officer]] [[Sinjir Rath Velus]], and the New Republic soldier [[Jom Barell]] traveled to the planet [[Irudiru]] after learning that Solo had last been sighted at [[Warrin Station]]. There, they found Solo while scouting the compound of the [[Siniteen]] prison designer [[Golas Aram]]. At a nearby [[cantina]], Solo informed his allies that he had discovered that Chewbacca was being held at Ashmead's Lock and that Aram was responsible for designing the prison. During their initial encounter, Solo was accosted by Mister Bones, who mistook him for a threat.<ref name="Life Debt" />

Working together, Solo and Norra's team managed to breach the compound and capture Aram. Under duress, Aram told the rebels how to enter Ashmead's Lock. However, he omitted to give them the password that would allow them unhindered passage inside the prison. Traveling to the Kashyyyk system in the ''Millennium Falcon'' and Emari's ship ''[[Halo]]'', Solo and Norra's team managed to gain clearance to land at Ashmead's Lock by claiming to be a repair team. Upon entering the prison, Han and the rebels were accosted by the prison's computer security system [[Synthesized Operating Layer, Grid-Based Drive Array|SOL-GDA]], which dispatched security droids to integrate them.<ref name="Life Debt" />

Temmin discovered that the prison was being powered by the prisoners who were being housed inside stasis cells. Using this information, Han and Norra managed to disable the power generator. As a result, Han and Norra's team were able to free Chewbacca and a hundred other prisoners including Norra's husband and Temmin's father [[Brentin Lore Wexley]]. While Norra, Temmin, and Mister Bones took the liberated prisoners back to Chandrila on the ''Falcon'', Han stayed behind with Chewbacca, Jas, Sinjir, and Jom to complete their mission to liberate the Wookies. Unknown to Han and his allies, the Imperial [[Fleet Admiral]] [[Gallius Rax]] had inserted inorganic bio-chip implants inside the prisoners as part of a [[Attack on Chandrila|plot]] to assassinate the New Republic leadership.<ref name="Life Debt" />

=====Liberating Kashyyyk=====
Han and his team learned that [[Grand Moff]] [[Lozen Tolruck]] had fitted all of the Wookiees on Kashyyyk with [[Control chip|inhibitor chips]]. Tolruck controlled these inhibitor chips with a control module which he kept on his person. For the next month, Han and his team spent their time searching for Tolruck's island fortress and gathering Wookiee exiles and smugglers for a mass uprising. On one mission, Jom Barell was captured by Tolruck's forces and imprisoned at his [[Lozen Tolruck's island fortress|island fortress]]. While Sinjir entered the island fortress to free Jom and disabled Tolruck's control module, Han and his team disabled the deflector shield generator at [[Camp Sardo]]. Despite being attacked by Imperial forces, Jas managed to take out the shield generator.<ref name="Life Debt" />

After Sinjir disabled Tolruck's control module, a mass planetwide Wookiee uprising broke out. The Wookiees and their rebel allies quickly overwhelmed the outnumbered Imperial garrison. When the orbiting Imperial Star Destroyers began bombarding Kashyyyk, Han, Chewbacca, and their fellow rebels managed to evacuate the civilians underground. They then took a ship loaded with [[webweaver]] [[spider]]s aboard the Star Destroyer ''[[Dominion]]'' and fought their way through the ship's corridors. However, they were captured by stormtroopers who brought them before [[Vice Admiral]] [[Domm Korgale]].<ref name="Life Debt" />

Before the Admiral could eliminate Han and his team, New Republic reinforcements arrived in the Kashyyyk system in the form of his wife Leia and the ''Millennium Falcon'', Antilles' Phantom Squadron, and Admiral Ackbar's flagship ''[[Home One]]''. Han and Chewbacca managed to break free of their captors and seize control of the ''Dominion''. Han and his team then turned the ship's guns on the Star Destroyer ''[[Vitiator]]''. As a result, the remaining Star Destroyer ''Neutralizer'' surrendered to Admiral Ackbar. <ref name="Life Debt" />

Following the battle, Han and Leia experienced an emotional reunion aboard the ''Dominion''. Returning to Kashyyyk, Han, Chewbacca, and Leia learnt about the Liberation Day attacks on Chandrila. With the Wookiees undertaking mop up operations against the remaining Imperial holdouts on Kashyyyk, Han insisted that Chewbacca stay behind and reunite with his [[Chewbacca's family|family]]. However, he told Chewbacca that he would return if he ever needed help. Han then left Kashyyyk aboard the ''Falcon'' with his wife Leia and their unborn child [[Kylo Ren|Ben Solo]].<ref name="Life Debt" />

====Balancing family and duty====
Over the next several months leading to the [[Battle of Jakku]], Han Solo and Princess Leia prepared for the coming of their child. With Leia approaching labor, Solo hired a protocol droid named [[T-2LC]] (or "Elsie") as a nanny. One day, Solo bought his wife a sack of [[jogan fruit]]s. Leia was annoyed with Solo for overdoing it and reminded him that Dr [[Harter Kalonia]] had said to incorporate jogan into her diet and not to replace everything with it. While chatting with his wife about the liberation of Kashyyyk and galactic politics, Han and his wife Leia was contacted on [[hologram]] by the New Republic operative Norra Wexley. Norra informed that she was traveling to the [[Inner Rim]] world of [[Jakku]] to hunt down [[Grand Admiral]] [[Rae Sloane]], the purported instigator behind the Liberation Day attacks on Chandrila.<ref name="Empire's End">''[[Aftermath: Empire's End]]''</ref>

[[Norra Wexley's team]] subsequently discovered that most of the Galactic Empire had retreat to Jakku. While Norra, the bounty hunter Jas Emari, and the battle droid Mister Bones infiltrated Jakku, Temmin and Sinjir returned to Chandrila with news about the Imperial presence. They visited Leia's domicile and managed to warn Princess Leia and Han Solo about the Empire. Temmin tried to convince Solo to lend him his famous freighter, the ''Millennium Falcon''. However, Solo thought that the mission was too risky and was unwilling to risk losing his ship.<ref name="Empire's End" />

Before the argument could escalate, Chancellor Mon Mothma entered the domicile and asked Temmin and Sinjir about the Imperial presence on Jakku. Following the meeting, Temmin and Sinjir managed to convince Han and Leia to lend them the ''Millennium Falcon''. However, the two were stopped from leaving Chandrila by [[Senate Guard (New Republic)|Senate Guards]] who had been dispatched by Senator [[Tolwar Wartol]], a rival of Chancellor Mothma. Wartol had secretly installed a listening device inside T-2LC. In an attempt to discredit Chancellor Mothma, Wartol leaked news about the Imperial presence to [[HoloNet News]]. Solo and Leia learnt about the leak while watching the morning news.<ref name="Empire's End" />

====Unmasking a conspiracy====
Han and Leia were later confronted by an angry Sinjir, who believed that they had double-crossed him and Temmin. Han and Leia managed to set the record straight. They then realized that Senator Wartol's leak and the Senate guards stopping Sinjir and Temmin were linked. When Sinjir voiced his suspicion that there was a spy bug in Leia's domicile, Han did not believe it but Leia shared Sinjir's suspicion. Sinjir brought his former lover [[Conder Kyl]], who as a slicer, to Leia's domicile. Conder found that the listening device was inside T-2LC. Following the discovery, Han told Elsie to hold still and warned that it was going to sting a little.<ref name="Empire's End" />

After removing the listening device and handing it to Chancellor Mothma, Han led a team consisting of Sinjir, Temmin, Conder, and Jom Barell to the New Republic's new capital of [[Nakadia]]. Their [[Mission to Nakadia|mission]] was to investigate the five senators who had opposed Chancellor Mothma's resolution to send military forces to Jakku: [[Ashmin Ek]], [[Rethalow]], [[Dor Wieedo]], [[Grelka Sorka]], and [[Nim Tar]]. While Sinjir and the others trailed four of the senators at a restaurant called [[Izzik's]] in Nakadia's capital [[Quarrow]], Han went to spy on Senator Dor Wieedo. The Rodian senator was aboard his ship at the northernmost spaceport outside Quarrow.<ref name="Empire's End" />

After several hours had passed, Solo witnessed two [[Nikto]] and a [[Klatooinian]] approach Wieedo's ship. Unknown to Solo, these aliens were members of the [[Red Key Raiders]], a crime syndicate that was plotting with Black Sun to prolong the war. Solo managed to warn his comrades. However, the criminals discovered his presence and locked him in a rubbish bin. Meanwhile, Conder was kidnapped by other Red Key gangsters. Sinjir and Temmin managed to find Solo and returned to the ''Falcon''. Despite their setbacks, Jom managed to kidnap Senator Rethalow, who confessed to his dealings with Red Key and Black Sun.<ref name="Empire's End" />

Before they could spirit Rethalow away into hiding, Han and his team members decided to rescue Conder, [[Nim Tar's child]], and Sorka's [[Grelka Sorka's jerba|pet]] [[jerba]]. Conder managed to use his [[transceiver tooth]] to transmit his coordinates to Sinjir. Han and his team flew the ''Millennium Falcon'' through a red warehouse roof, which turned out to be the Red Key's base. After subduing the gangsters, they managed to rescue Conder and Nim Tar's child. Posing as an adviser to the Chancellor, Sinjir transmitted a missive offering the five senators pardons and other political favors if they changed their votes during the re-vote scheduled to be held at the [[Quarrow Senate house]]. As a result, Mothma's resolution passed and the New Republic was able to dispatch military forces to Jakku.<ref name="Empire's End" />

====War's end====
{{Quote|Yeah. You, me, Luke. Chewie. The ''Falcon''. Those two walking talking garbage cans. It feels weird we're not part of it.''"<br>"''We've got our own adventure.|Han and Leia|Aftermath: Empire's End}}
Following the events on Nakadia, Han returned home and reunited with his wife. When Leia praised him for "making things right", Solo told her that the Battle of Jakku was happening. He predicted that it would be a big battle. In private, Han confided that it felt strange that he, Leia, Luke, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and R2-D2 were not part of the final battle. Leia reassured him that they had their own adventure. Han responded that it was the end of an era while Leia replied that it was the start of a new one.<ref name="Empire's End" />

The Battle of Jakku turned out to be a decisive victory for the New Republic. Facing imminent defeat, [[Grand Vizier]] [[Mas Amedda]] on Coruscant sent peace overtures to Chancellor Mothma. Han and his wife attended the peace talks where Chancellor Mothma and Grand Vizier Amedda signed the [[Imperial Instruments of Surrender]] and the [[Galactic Concordance]]. The signing occurred during the third hour of Leia's labor but she only told her husband after the ceremony was complete. Solo rushed her to the birthing chamber in the heart of [[Hanna City]].<ref name="Empire's End" />

[[File:Han Leia and Ben.jpg|244x244px|left|thumb|Solo with his wife and son.]]
Leia gave birth to a son named Ben Solo. Following a gathering of family and friends, Han stared into his son's eyes and pondered how he had become a father. While Leia was showering in the next room, Solo told his son that while the whole galaxy was against them they would still make it through okay. Though Solo confided that he might not make a good father, he promised to keep them pointed in the right direction. Solo also gave Ben his first lesson: sometimes doing the right thing doesn't mean following a straight line. Solo told his baby son not to tell his mother.<ref name="Empire's End" />

When Ben cried, Han tried to comfort with a small [[tooka doll]] but this failed to pacify the baby. Leia then heard her son crying. When Han said that it was not his fault, Leia reassured him that babies cried. Han sensed that Leia had a connection through the Force that he could never have with Ben. Han suggested using the Force but Leia advised him to pick up their son and snuggle him. Han reluctantly snuggled his son and Ben stopped crying. When Han sighed that he could never have the same Force connection, Leia told him that fathers had a special connection with their offspring.<ref name="Empire's End" />

===Cold war===
====Starting a family====
{{Quote|I'll be back. We're not done, you and I. We'll see each other again. I'm gonna be a father and no way my kid won't have you in his life.|Han Solo parting ways with Chewbacca|Aftermath: Life Debt}}
Finding himself husband of an important politician, Han passed the time by becoming a successful racing pilot.<ref name="TFA VD">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> In the years after the end of the Galactic Civil War, Solo became the owner of a [[Han Solo's shipping company|shipping company]] and developed a reputation for being a vigilant and responsible owner. Outside of his work, Han often raced for charity and sponsored several piloting matches. Due to his work, Solo found himself traveling through different systems, working on ships.<ref name="Bloodline" />

Their son, Ben, proved to be Force-sensitive and was sent to be trained by his uncle [[Luke Skywalker]] in the ways of the Force.<ref name="Episode VII" /> Meanwhile, his wife Leia served as a prominent [[Senator]] in the [[Galactic Senate (New Republic)|Galactic Senate]] on [[Hosnian Prime]], the capital of the New Republic. Han and his family lived separate lives but kept in touch with his wife via hologram.<ref name="Bloodline" />

====Separate lives====

[[File:Scorched-Han-Solo.jpg|thumb|right|299x299px|For a time, Solo managed the Five Sabers racing championship.]]
Twenty four years after the Battle of Endor, Han Solo traveled to the planet [[Theron]] to manage a prestigious racing championship called the [[Five Sabers]]. While staying in temporary quarters, he corresponded with Leia, who told her husband about the fractured state of the Galactic Senate. When Leia told Han about her desire to resign from the Senate, Han expressed puzzlement since his wife had devoted much of her adult life to politics. Sensing Leia's frustration, Solo invited his wife to take a break and travel around the galaxy with him for three months. Despite their different personalities, Leia agreed that she needed a break from her senatorial career.<ref name="Bloodline" />

However, Leia was forced to suspend her vacation plans after her faction, the [[Populists]], convinced her to stand for the position of [[First Senator]]. The rival [[Centrists|Centrist]] faction, which supported a stronger central government, had successfully passed a motion calling for the creation of First Senator in order to end the deadlock plaguing the Republic. Despite their initial opposition, the Populists, who preferred a more decentralized government, had decided to change tactics in order to prevent a Centrist from holding that office. Due to her prestige as a prominent former rebel leader, Leia had reluctantly agreed to allow an exploratory committee to explore her suitability for First Senator.<ref name="Bloodline" />

While Han was repairing the rear engines of a starship, he was contacted by his wife. Solo was mildly disappointed with his wife's change of plans but agreed that a Populist should serve as First Senator. Solo also informed his wife that he was supervising the lunar relays of the Five Sabers. Due to the complicated nature of the repairs, Han remarked that he wished that [[Greer Sonnel]], a former racer and [[Junior Sabers]] champion who was serving as Leia's pilot, was still on his team. When Leia apologized for delaying their planned holiday, Han reassured her that she was doing the right thing by putting duty to the New Republic first. Leia promised to take a break with her husband "someday."<ref name="Bloodline" />

In addition to the First Senatorship, Leia was involved in a sensitive Senate investigation into the Nikto crime lord [[Rinnrivin Di]]'s [[Rinnrivin Di's cartel|cartel]], a new criminal outfit that was choking the economy of the [[Gaulus sector]]. Leia was assisted in this investigation by an unlikely ally, the idealistic Centrist senator [[Ransolm Casterfo]]. Over the course of their investigation, the two discovered that Rinnrivin was linked to a paramilitary faction called the [[Amaxine warriors]]. In an attempt to sow discord, [[Arliz Hadrassian]], a former TIE fighter pilot who had become the Amaxines' leader, [[Napkin Bombing|bombed]] the [[New Republic senatorial complex]]'s [[Senatorial conference building|conference building]]. Leia survived the bombing and transmitted a voice-message telling her husband that she was safe and that he did not need to come to Hosnian Prime. While on Theron, Solo received news about the Senate bombing and saw footage of the damage. Later, Solo contacted Leia to send his wife a goodwill message and to keep in touch.<ref name="Bloodline" />

While Leia was visiting [[Ryloth]] as part of her investigation, Han Solo sent a holomessage expressing hope that his wife's side project was going well. He informed her that the Five Sabers was heading to the fourth stage of the Sabers. Due to the sublight relay round, Han told her that he would be out of comm range for a while. He also told her to take care of herself and complimented her.<ref name="Bloodline" />

====Rescue on Sibensko====
{{Quote|Sorry, I'm late, sweetheart.''"<br>"''Honey, you're right on time.|Han reuniting with his wife on Sibensko|Bloodline (novel)}}
Han and Leia would cross paths again due to unforeseen circumstances. Later, the Centrist Senator Lady [[Carise Sindian]], a secret agent of an Imperial remnant known as the [[First Order]], discovered information about Leia's true parentage as the daughter of Darth Vader on [[Birren]]. Alarmed at the friendship between Ransolm Casterfo and Leia, Lady Carise shared this information with him; knowing Ransolm's hatred for Vader. Feeling betrayed, Casterfo upstaged the Senate hearing into Leia's nomination for First Senator by revealing Leia's parentage to the assembled senators. This revelation destroyed Leia's credibility and forced her to withdraw her nomination.<ref name="Bloodline" />

Still determined to continue her investigation into Rinnrivin's cartel and the Amaxines, Leia and her team took leave to travel to [[Sibensko]], where the two groups were hiding. There, Leia discovered that the Amaxines were funding Rinnrivin's cartel and were also marshaling troops, weapons, and starships for an attack on the New Republic. During her [[Mission to Sibensko|mission]], Leia was pursued by the Amaxine warriors and fled up a landing platform, where she was corned by two Amaxine starfighters. Han arrived on a [[Racer (vehicle)|racer]] and rescued his wife. Together, couple shot down the enemy fighters. One of the fighters, a [[A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter|B-wing]] collided with the underwater base's ammunition depot; triggering a massive explosion that destroyed the underwater city and the Amaxine army.<ref name="Bloodline" />

Following the Sibensko mission, Han and his wife returned to Leia's apartment in Hosnian Prime. When Leia expressed despair that many of her former colleagues and comrades were shunning her for simply being Vader's daughter, Solo reassured her that this storm would pass and that people would remember her for who she was. Han counselled his wife to remember those friends who stuck by her and to ignore the rest of the galaxy. When Han criticized Casterfo, Leia sprung to her former friend's defense by pointing out that he was a decent man who hated Vader. Han then advised his wife to forget Casterfo and to use the political scandal as an opportunity to retire from politics for good.<ref name="Bloodline" />

However, Leia still had one piece of unfinished business left: the findings of her investigation into Rinnrivin Di's cartel and the Amaxines. Leia wanted to address the Senate but she needed to gain a quorum from a majority of senators. While Han thought that no more threats to the Republic existed with the demise of Rinnrivin and the Amaxines, Leia suspected that there were other like-minded groups seeking to overthrow the Republic. Han counseled his wife to rest for the night and the couple expressed their love for each other.<ref name="Bloodline" />

The following morning, the sports channels reported that Han Solo had left the [[Theron system]] after the end of the last Sabers round. There was also speculation on whether he would return for the final championship race. Later that evening, Han bought his wife [[Bilbringi]] cheesy meat pies for dinner. While eating, the couple received news that Leia had received a quorum to address the Senate due to Casterfo's favorable vote. Han then told his wife that things would improve and that he would stay with her for as long as she needed him. Leia reassured her husband that she would be able to handle the hearing on her own and told him that he could return to the Sabers championship. Shortly later, Solo returned to the Five Sabers race.<ref name="Bloodline" />

====Family strife====
At some point after the public revelations about Leia and Ben's relationship to Darth Vader,<ref>[[Claudia Gray]]'s novel ''[[Bloodline (novel)|Bloodline]]'' clarifies that Ben was ignorant of his grand-parentage until [[Ransolm Casterfo]]'s revelation in the [[Galactic Senate (New Republic)|Galactic Senate]]</ref> Han's son, Ben Solo, was seduced by [[Supreme Leader]] [[Snoke]] and eventually succumbed to the dark side, [[Destruction of Luke Skywalker's Jedi Temple|killing]] the Jedi Luke was [[Jedi Order|training]]. Taking the blame for Ben's fall, Luke [[Ahch-To|exiled himself]]. Unable to cope with the loss of their son, Han and Leia separated.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Han and Chewbacca went back to being smugglers again which Han claimed was "the only thing he was ever good at". Meanwhile, Leia became the leader of the [[Resistance]], a paramilitary organization aimed at fighting the First Order, which had begun to pose a threat to the New Republic. Han then got himself into a lot of debt with various creditors including the notorious [[Guavian Death Gang]] and [[Kanjiklub]], and lost the ''Falcon'' as well. At some point, Han and Chewbacca managed to obtain a [[Baleen-class heavy freighter|''Baleen''-class heavy freighter]] named the ''[[Eravana]]'' that they used for their smuggling operations and had even assembled a crew to assist them. Han spent the majority of his free time trying to track down the ''Falcon''.<ref name="Episode VII" />

====Smuggler's Run====
[[File:Team_Falcon_in_Seredipity_cantina.jpg|thumb|left|202x202px|Confrontation with bounty hunters in the ''Serendipity''.]]
Sometime later, Solo and Chewbacca went to the ''Serendipity'', a yacht that was owned by Leighton. Solo then engaged a trio of bounty hunters‚Äî[[Strater]], [[Hove]], and [[Rigger]]‚Äîsent to capture him on the ''Serendipity'' cantina, and told them about their mission to Cyrkon before they realized who he was. Once they were aware of Solo's identity, Chewbacca sneaked behind them and took hold of Rigger, only to send him flying to the ''Serendipity''{{'s}} door and knock Strater out with a punch, while Solo disarmed Bobbie. Then, the Corellian told them to warn their possible employers ([[Gannis Ducain]], the [[Irving Boys]], the Guavians, etc.) that they were not afraid of them, before saying goodbye to Leighton and leaving the bar together.<ref name="Smuggler's Run" />

====Alderaanian data archive heist====
[[File:First Order Han & Chewie.jpg|thumb|right|235x235px|Solo, posing as a First Order officer aboard [[Mek Nu'Tiv's cruiser]].]]
Solo and Chewbacc stole a [[Xi-class light shuttle|''Xi''-class light shuttle]] from the [[Fluzhi Clan Shipyard|shipyard]] of the [[Fluzhi Clan]]. They were succesful in escaping from the shipyard and planned to use codes from [[Finwej]] to steal a weapons archive from [[Mek Nu'Tiv]]. Solo hope to use the archive to get several people they owed money to off their backs. Soling, posing as a First Order officer, boarded Mek Nu'Tiv's cruiser and spoke with her and her crew. Nu'Tiv however, realized that Solo had used Finwej to get credits and had her crew hold him at gunpoint. <ref name="PD annual 2">''[[Poe Dameron Annual 2]]''</ref>

====Retaking the Falcon====

[[File:HanIsHome-TFA.png|thumb|left|271x271px|Solo pleased to be back aboard the ''Falcon'']]
Thirty years after the Battle of Endor, while transporting a cargo of three rathtars aboard the ''Eravana'', Han and Chewie found the ''Falcon'' floating in space near the desert planet of Jakku, pulling his prized vessel in with a tractor beam. Upon boarding their old vessel, the two went about inspecting their ship and found two stowaways, Jakku scavenger [[Rey]] and former First Order [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtrooper]] [[Finn]], who he assumed were the thieves that had stolen the ''Falcon''. When Rey and Finn explained that they were going to take a droid named [[BB-8]] to the Resistance as he had a map that would the location of Solo's old friend Luke Skywalker, Han and Chewie agreed to help them.<ref name="Episode VII" />

====Skirmish aboard the ''Eravana''====

Han's freighter had been boarded by the Guavian Death Gang and Kanjiklub, whom Solo was indebted to. Not wanting Rey and Finn to be involved, Han placed both of them in the lower corridors of the freighter while he and Chewie went to meet with the criminals, with BB-8 accompanying them. The smuggler tried but failed to convince both gangs that he would fix things eventually, with one of the gang leaders threatening to take away the ''Millennium Falcon'' as payback. Han having just retrieved his vessel, responded that they would have to take it over his dead body. One of the criminals then recognized the BB-8 unit from a First Order bounty placed on it along with Rey and Finn, and demanded that Han hand over the droid and any stowaways he might have on board. Right before a firefight broke out, Rey accidentally released the Rathtars, providing a diversion for an escape in the ''Falcon''.<ref name="Episode VII" />

====Journey to Takodana====

[[File:MeetingWithMaz-TFA.png|left|thumb|269x269px|Han asks Maz Kanata to get BB-8 to the Resistance]]
Han explained that Luke tried to rebuild the Jedi Order, but an apprentice of his turned to the dark side and became Kylo Ren, destroying all that Luke had built, including the other [[Padawan]]s that Luke had trained. Feeling responsible and blaming himself for the failure, Luke went into exile.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Solo took Rey and Finn to the planet Takodana to meet his old friend Kanata at her castle. He also gave Rey an [[NN-14 blaster pistol]]. There, he learned that Kanata had found and kept the old lightsaber that once belonged to Luke, and he asked where Kanata got the weapon, but Kanata dismissed him, saying it was a story for another time. While there, the First Order was alerted to BB-8's presence and attacked. During the ensuing battle, he killed several stormtroopers both with his DL-44 blaster and Chewbacca's [[bowcaster]], Solo, Finn, and Chewbacca were initially captured, but escaped when the Resistance, also alerted to BB-8's presence, counterattacked. Despite the First Order being driven off, Han witnessed his son Kylo Ren carrying away Rey. Among his rescuers on Takodana was Han's estranged wife, General Leia Organa. She took Han, Chewbacca, Finn, and BB-8 to the Resistance [[Resistance base|base]] on [[D'Qar]].<ref name="Episode VII" />

====Reunited at the Resistance Base====

[[File:Han and Leia hug TFA.png|right|thumb|245x245px|Organa embraces Solo]]
It is revealed that Han and Leia are aware that their son is Kylo Ren, and that their son's fall to the Dark Side caused them to separate, with Han returning to his smuggling business, and Leia spearheading the activities of the New Republic and the Resistance. As Starkiller Base prepared to wipe out the world of D'Qar, the site of the Resistance's headquarters, the Resistance planned an [[Battle of Starkiller Base|attack]] of their own. Finn had given them the Base's blueprints, which revealed that the base drained the energy of the [[Star|sun]] in order to charge its superweapon, and that it required a [[thermal oscillator]], which sustained the energy on the planet, that, if destroyed, would de-stabilize the planet's core and implode the Base. However, they would need to do it before the Base fully charged its weapon. Having [[Battle of Endor|experience]] in taking down superweapons' shield generators, Solo and Chewbacca volunteered to disable the shield. Before he left, Leia told Han to find their son, and convince him to reject the dark side and return to the [[Light side of the Force|light]].<ref name="Episode VII" />

====Battle of Starkiller Base====

[[File:HanChewieFinn-TFA.png|thumb|left|254x254px|Han, Finn, and Chewbacca sneak into Starkiller Base to disable the shields.]]
Solo, Finn, and Chewie took the ''Millennium Falcon'' to Starkiller Base, exiting hyperspace inside the planet's shield just above the surface and landing just at the side of a high cliff. When Finn revealed his stationing had previously been in 'sanitation' and that the real reason he came along was to rescue Rey from the First Order, Solo and Chewbacca agreed to help him with a bit of annoyance. While inside the base, they captured Captain [[Phasma]] and forced her to lower the shields, after which Solo claimed that they would not leave the base without Rey.<ref name="Episode VII" />

====Death====

[[File:Kylo kills Solo.png|thumb|right|280x280px|Han is impaled by his own son's lightsaber.]]
After finding Rey, the group headed to Starkiller Base's thermal oscillator to assist the Resistance pilots above in its destruction. While planting explosives with Chewbacca, Solo spotted Ren and confronted him on a long walkway positioned above a massive pit, where he attempted to convince his son to leave the First Order and come back with him. Ren handed his lightsaber to Solo, saying he was being "torn apart" and had one last thing to do. After a brief moment of emotional struggle, Ben activated the weapon and it passed through his own father's torso. As Rey, Finn, and Chewbacca watched in horror, Solo stroked his son's face for the last time before dying, his corpse falling over the side of the bridge and into the pit below. Leia sensed her husband's death through the Force and wept for his loss. Solo's death was later [[Mourning|mourned]] by Organa, Chewbacca, and Rey when they returned to the Resistance Base from Starkiller Base after its destruction.<ref name="Episode VII" />

After Solo's death, Rey, Chewbacca, and R2-D2 flew in the ''Millennium Falcon'' and journeyed to the planet Ahch-To to recruit Jedi Master Luke Skywalker to the Resistance's cause while Kylo Ren recovered from the injuries he sustained during the Battle of Starkiller Base. As Skywalker cut himself from the Force since he went into exile, he was unaware of what was happening in the galaxy, so he didn't feel Solo's death,<ref name="TLJVD" /> leading him to ask Rey and Chewie what had happened to his brother-in-law.<ref name="Episode VIII">[[Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VIII ''The Last Jedi'']]</ref> Upon becoming aware of Solo's fate, Skywalker regretted not having sensed it as he had cut himself from the Force, leading Chewbacca to hug him before Rey asked him to train her.<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 1">''[[The Last Jedi Adaptation 1]]''</ref>

To the mutual surprise of both Rey and Kylo, a [[Force-bond]] had developed between them, psychically linking their [[Brain|minds]] across the galaxy. The bond enabled them to both see and hear each other through a series of shared [[Force vision]]s, despite being in two separate locations. At first, Rey swore to make Ren answer for his patricidal actions, although Ren was more intrigued by the connection they shared than Rey's threats. Unable to understand the act of killing one's own father, Rey assumed that Ren hated his father, but the dark side warrior insisted that he did not hate Solo, causing Rey to beseech him for an explanation. He then revealed to the Jedi aspirant his desire to completely sever himself from the past, believing it was the only way to move forward and achieve his destiny.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

It was ultimately through their bond that Rey was able to gain new insights into Ren, making her aware of the conflict between the dark side and the light within him. Unable to persuade Skywalker to end his self-imposed [[Exile (punishment)|exile]], she concluded that the son of Han Solo was the last hope of the galaxy, and therefore went directly to Ren in the hope of helping him find redemption in the light. Her arrival on the [[First Order Navy]] [[flagship]] ''[[Supremacy]]'' provided Ren with an [[Attack on the Resistance fleet|opportunity]] to [[assassin]]ate his dark side mentor, Supreme Leader Snoke. Although they worked together to kill Snoke's [[Elite Praetorian Guard|Praetorian Guards]], Rey was dismayed to see that Ren did not intend to forsake his allegiance to the dark side.

When Skywalker later [[Force projection|projected]] at the planet of [[Crait]] from Ahch-To in order to confront Ren, he mentioned that Han would always be with him. Before succumbing to his projection, Skywalker's last words to Kylo were "See you around, kid", remembering Solo even in the last seconds of his life.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> After escaping from the First Order aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'', both Organa and Chewbacca seated on the cockpit, where Organa remembered a young Solo sitting on the captain's seat, asking her what she was thinking.

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Han fancied himself a scoundrel. But he wasn't. He loved freedom‚Äîfor himself, certainly, but for everybody else in the galaxy, too. And time after time, he was willing to fight for that freedom. He didn't want to know the odds in that fight‚Äîbecause he‚Äôd already made up his mind that he'd prevail. And time after time, somehow, he did.|Leia Organa|Star Wars: The Last Jedi: Expanded Edition}}
[[File:ILikeThisThing-TFA.png|left|thumb|271x271px|Solo tells Chewie how much he likes the Wookiee's [[Chewbacca's bowcaster|bowcaster]].]]
Han Solo was a cynical, disagreeable individual whose primary concern was gaining enough money to preserve his own life. He and Luke immediately disliked each other: Solo found Luke irritating and overly eager, and his open disdain for Kenobi's beliefs and actions did little to change Luke's initial view of Solo as an extortionist.<ref name="Episode IV" /> However, after Han demonstrated his bravery on the Death Star and proved his loyalty, they became genuine friends, and soon after, Han would become loyal to the Rebellion. Aside from his seemingly self-centered ways, Han was actually very loyal to his friends, and a good man.<ref name="Episode VI" />

Han's wife Leia described him as someone who had no patience for speeches or memorials, was allergic to politics and suspicious of causes. However, according to Leia, he also hated bullies and could never stand down when confronted with them, and when he took on a difficult mission, he was never interested in knowing the odds of succeeding.<ref name="Expanded Edition">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: Expanded Edition]]''</ref>

Following the Battle of Endor, Han endeavored to honor Chewie's "life debt" to him by liberating the enslaved Wookiee homeworld from Imperial occupation.<ref name="Aftermath" /> Despite several setbacks, Han persisted with his mission. Together, Han and Chewie led a combined force of Wookiees, rebels, and mercenaries to spark a successful Wookiee uprising against the Empire. During the campaign, Han displayed resourcefulness and proved a cunning and effective commander. After the liberation of Kashyyyk, Han freed Chewbacca of his life debt so that he could reunite with his family.<ref name="Life Debt" />

Han Solo initially found the task of fatherhood challenging. While he envied Leia's Force connection to their son Ben Solo, Han found that he had a special bond as a father.<ref name="Empire's End" /> Due to their different interests and personalities, Solo and his wife lived separate lives. While she served as a New Republic senator, Solo managed a shipping company and organized starship races. Still, Solo kept in regular contact with his wife Leia. On one occasion, he rescued Leia from a pro-Imperial militia known as the Amaxine warriors.<ref name="Bloodline" />

Solo and Leia took their son's descent to the dark side badly. Their marriage collapsed and the two separated. With his shipping business floundering, Han resumed smuggling and incurred large debts with the criminal gangs Kanjiklub and the Guavian Death Gang. Solo regained his purpose when the scavenger Rey and the former stormtrooper Finn sought his help in smuggling the droid BB-8, who was carrying a [[Map to Skywalker]], to the Resistance. After reconciling with his wife General Leia, Solo decided to try and bring his son back. Despite an emotional reunion between father and son, Kylo Ren killed his father Han. Han's death devastated Leia, Chewbacca, and Rey, who had come to view him as a father figure.<ref name="Episode VII" /> BB-8 would then remember Solo as a "maniac", to which R2-D2 clarified that Solo was "one of the best maniacs".<ref name="Poe Dameron 28" />

==Romances==

===[[Qi'ra]]===
[[File:Han and Qi'ra kiss.JPG|thumb|right|227x227px|Solo kisses Qi'ra.]]
Solo met Qi'ra when they were Scrumrats of the White Worms.<ref name="Solo" /> During one of their jobs, Solo and Qi'ra were forced to partner up on a job. After Qi'ra was named Head, Solo and Qi'ra had dinner with, which Solo believed was their first date.<ref name="Most Wanted" /> Solo eventually fell in love with Qi'ra. Solo and Qi'ra made plans to buy a ship and run away together, but they were separated. Despite Solo promising to come back for her, Qi'ra joined Crimson Dawn. When the two reunited on the ''[[First Light]]'', they rekindled their love for each other. Despite their feelings for each other, Qi'ra chose to stay in Crimson Dawn and leave Solo.<ref name="Solo" />

===[[Leia Organa]]===

==Behind the scenes==
===Origins and development===
{{Quote|You old stardog. Took a war to get you out here&hellip;|Han Solo's opening line in the rough draft of ''The Star Wars''|url=http://www.starwarz.com/starkiller/scripts/thestarwars_rough_draft.htm}}
Han Solo was created by [[George Lucas]] during the development of Lucas' [[1977]] film ''[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' and is present in Lucas' 132-page ''[[The Star Wars: Rough Draft]]'', completed in [[May (month)|May]] [[1974]]. In the draft, Solo is a [[Yourellian|Ureallian]], and is described as a huge green-skinned monster with no nose and large gills. He is a member of the Jedi Bendu and an old friend of General Skywalker.<ref name="rough draft">{{Cite_web|url=http://www.starwarz.com/starkiller/scripts/thestarwars_rough_draft.htm|title=THE STAR WARS by George Lucas - Rough Draft|work=Starkiller - The Jedi Bendu Script Site|accessdate=2010-05-24}}</ref> As Lucas refined his story, Solo evolved into a burly, bearded, flamboyantly-dressed pirate.<ref name="db">{{DB|character|hansolo|Solo, Han}}</ref> Although Lucas had originally intended for Solo to be a nefarious alien character, he settled on the idea of a human so that he could develop more of a relationship between the film's three primary characters. Chewbacca thus filled the role of the alien sidekick.<ref name="characters">The Characters of ''Star Wars'' - [[Star Wars Trilogy (DVD)]]</ref> By [[August]] [[1975]], when Lucas had written his [[Adventures of the Starkiller, Episode I: The Star Wars|third draft]], Solo was described as: "A tough [[Wikipedia:James Dean|James Dean]] style starpilot about twenty-five years old. A [[Wikipedia:Cowboy#Popular_culture|cowboy]] in a starship -- simple, sentimental and cocksure of himself."<ref name="third draft">{{Cite_web|url=http://www.starwarz.com/starkiller/scripts/thestarwars_third_draft.htm|title="THE STAR WARS" - From The Adventures of Luke Starkiller by George Lucas|work=Starkiller - The Jedi Bendu Script Site|accessdate=2010-05-24}}</ref> This incarnation of Solo's character went on to appear in the finished film.<ref name="Episode IV" /><ref name="db" />''<nowiki/>''

While developing Solo's character, Lucas defined him in relation to the film's hero, Luke Skywalker. Selflessness was an important theme throughout the film, and Skywalker was a selfless young idealist. Lucas thought of Solo as the sidekick with contrary morals to the hero, and wrote him as a selfish character.<ref name="characters" /> [[Harrison Ford]], who portrayed Solo in all three films of ''[[Star Wars]]''{{'s}} [[original trilogy]], has described Solo as the smartass to Skywalker's callow youth, with each character having had a clear section of turf to explore.<ref name="dreams">''[[Empire of Dreams]]''</ref>

[[Michael Arndt]] developed Kylo Ren as a convincing means to have Han and Leia separate after ''Return of the Jedi''. However, it was not decided to kill off the character until [[J.J. Abrams]] felt, "'What is Han doing in this movie?' If we‚Äôre not going to have something important and irreversible happen to him, then he kind of feels like luggage. He feels like this great, sexy piece of luggage you have in your movie. But he's not really evolving. He's not really pushing the story forward". Abrams decided killing off Han meant the character's son had a chance of becoming a worthy successor to Darth Vader.<ref name="ew">{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/12/21/jj-abrams-kylo-ren-shocking-act-star-wars-force-awakens|title=We Need To Talk About Kylo|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=2015-12-21|first=Anthony|last=Breznican|accessdate=2015-12-28}}</ref>

On [[May 6]], [[2016]], it was announced that [[Alden Ehrenreich]] would be playing the character in the upcoming [[Solo: A Star Wars Story|spinoff film]].<ref name="Cast">http://deadline.com/2016/05/star-wars-han-solo-movie-alden-ehrenreich-frontrunner-cast-1201737425/</ref>

===Portrayal===
{{Quote|I thought that the luck of the character was that he represented something close to the audience's sensibilities because of his distance and resistance to the mythology.|Harrison Ford|url=http://www.starwars.com/fans/events/esb30th_screening/index.html}}
When casting the role of Solo, Lucas sought actors who had individual screen presence as well as chemistry with Skywalker. He wanted Solo to be older than Skywalker and to possess a cynical edge. Lucas desired new and unknown actors to play ''Star Wars''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s major roles, and originally forbade Harrison Ford from auditioning, having worked with him on the [[1973]] film ''[[Wikipedia:American Graffiti|American Graffiti]]''.<ref name="dreams" /> Ford was working as a carpenter on the set of the auditions,<ref name="60mins">{{Cite_web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDC4JGyHQIE&feature=related|title=Harrison Ford on 60 Minutes (Part 2 of 2)|work=YouTube|accessdate=2010-05-24}}</ref><ref name="30years">{{SWArchive|url=fans/events/esb30th_screening/index.html|text=Report from the 30th Anniversary Empire Screening}}</ref> and was brought in by Lucas to feed lines to the actors who were auditioning,<ref name="dreams" /> including [[Wikipedia:Kurt Russell|Kurt Russell]], [[Wikipedia:Nick Nolte|Nick Nolte]], [[Wikipedia:Christopher Walken|Christopher Walken]],<ref name="db" /> and [[Perry King]]. While feeding lines, Ford impressed Lucas by giving the character a mix of mercenary swagger and world weariness, and convinced the director to let him play the part.<ref name="dreams" />

[[File:Relaxingontheset-MOSW.png|thumb|right|251x251px|Harrison Ford and his co-stars relax on the set of ''Star Wars''.]]
Ford went on to portray Solo in both of ''Star Wars''{{'s}} sequels, [[1980]]'s ''[[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|The Empire Strikes Back]]'' and [[1983]]'s ''[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]'', as well as [[1978]]'s ''[[The Star Wars Holiday Special]]''.<ref name="soloimdb">{{Cite_web|url=http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000002/|title=Han Solo (Character)|work=IMDB: The Internet Movie DataBase|accessdate=2010-05-24}}</ref> He was hesitant to sign the contracts for the sequels, however, feeling that Solo's character should be killed off.<ref name="q&a">{{Cite_web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20192918_2,00.html|title=Harrison Ford Q&A: Indy Speaks!|work=EW.com|accessdate=2010-05-24}}</ref> When Lucas was discussing the script of ''Return of the Jedi'' with director [[Richard Marquand]] and screenwriter [[Lawrence Kasdan]], the three were unsure if Ford would return for the film. Solo's character had been frozen in carbonite during the climax of ''The Empire Strikes Back'', and Ford was a rising star in Hollywood following his starring role as [[Indiana Jones]] in [[1981]]'s ''[[Wikipedia:Raiders of the Lost Ark|Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''. Ford himself thought that Solo should die in ''Jedi'', sacrificing himself to save Skywalker and Princess Leia. He reasoned that Solo had no family, future or responsibilities to the story,<ref name="dreams" /> and that his death would give the story some resonance.<ref name="q&a" /> Kasdan also believed that a major character death early in ''Jedi'' would keep audiences worried, believing that none of the characters were safe. Lucas vetoed the idea, however, and Solo ultimately survived.<ref name="dreams" />

The script of ''The Empire Strikes Back'' originally called for Solo to respond to Princess Leia's declaration of "I love you" with "I love you too". Ford disliked the line, feeling that the established character of Solo wasn't being taken advantage of. After many takes, director [[Irvin Kershner]] wasn't satisfied either. He told Ford not to think about it, and to say whatever he thought that Solo would say. When Ford improvised the line "I know", Kirshner felt that it was perfect for the character, and it was included in the film's final cut.<ref name="dreams" />

Harrison Ford has referred to Solo as an inherently relatable character to audiences, owing to his separation from the overarching mythological themes of the saga.<ref name="30years" /> However, he saw Solo as a chess piece that could be moved around and even killed, as the character wasn't as important to ''Star Wars'' as its Force-using characters.<ref name="q&a" /> Ford has called Solo a thin character,<ref name="starpulse">{{Cite_web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2006/03/02/harrison_ford_wanted_han_solo_to_die|title=Harrison Ford Wanted Han Solo to Die|work=StarPulse|accessdate=2010-05-27}}</ref><ref name="babs">{{Cite_web|url=http://www.harrisonfordweb.com/Article/Miscellaneous/barbra_walters.php|title=Barbra Walters Interview|work=Harrison Ford Web|accessdate=2010-05-27}}</ref> and one that wasn't interesting enough to be developed throughout several sequels, unlike Indiana Jones.<ref name="q&a" /><ref name="babs" /> As such, Ford thought that if Solo died in ''Return of the Jedi'', it would introduce a needed complication for the character and give the story resonance.<ref name="dreams" /><ref name="q&a" /><ref name="starpulse" />

In the animated microseries, ''[[Star Wars: Forces of Destiny]]'', the younger and older Han Solo is respectively voiced by [[AJ LoCascio]] and [[Kiff VandenHeuvel]].

===Rejected & Unused Concepts===

{{Quote|I found part of a transmitter droid near the east bay... I think it's still sending and receiving signals.|Han Solo's line from the rough draft of ''[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith]]''|The Making of Star Wars Revenge of the Sith}}
Several unused concepts and shots of Solo exist within ''Star Wars'' film lore. The scene that sees Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the viewer first meet Solo and Chewbacca in the original film was at one point set to feature Solo sitting with and kissing a woman named [[Jenny]].<ref name="dreams" /><ref name="jenny">{{DB|character|jenny|Jenny}}</ref> A young Han Solo was slated to appear on Kashyyyk in [[2005]]'s [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']], living among the planet's Wookiees as well as assisting [[Yoda]]. No actor was cast and the character was cut from the final draft.<ref name="making">''[[The Making of Star Wars Revenge of the Sith]]''</ref><ref name="art">''[[The Art of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]''</ref> However, the concept was somewhat recycled with [[Jaybo Hood]] in the ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' episode "[[Mystery of a Thousand Moons]]". George Lucas placed off-limits to possibility to use Han Solo in ''The Clone Wars'' when writer [[Henry Gilroy]] was writing the show bible,<ref>TheForce.net.[http://theforce.net/jedicouncil/interview/henrygilroyanddavefiloni.asp TheForce.net - Jedi Council - Interviews - Cellblock 1138 - Dave Filoni and Henry Gilroy]. Retrieved on [[November 18]], [[2017]].</ref> a restriction that was mantained until the show's cancellation.

While developing the story of [[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']], after director J.J. Abrams decided to kill off Solo in the film's climax, it was discussed how to show Kylo Ren stabbing Solo with his lightsaber. One proposal was to show Kylo stabbing Solo in front of the abyss just when he was getting his blaster from its holster, falling to his demise like in the finished version of the film. This idea, however, was ultimately cut.<ref>{{Cite_web|url=https://www.comicbookmovie.com/sci-fi/star_wars/new-star-wars-the-last-jedi-and-the-force-awakens-concept-art-focuses-on-dj-kylo-ren-and-han-solos-demise-a156572|title=New STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI And THE FORCE AWAKENS Concept Art Focuses On DJ, Kylo Ren And Han Solo's Demise|work=ComicBookMovie.com|accessdate=2018-01-11}}</ref>

===Return to the films and death===
Before reprising the role for ''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'', Ford indicated that he was unlikely to portray Solo again.<ref name="babs" /><ref name="mtv">{{Cite_web|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/01/12/exclusive-harrison-ford-is-done-with-han-solo/|title=EXCLUSIVE: Harrison Ford Is 'Done' With Han Solo|work=MTV Movies Blog|accessdate=2010-05-27}}</ref> When asked if Ford was sad when they finally killed off the character, director J.J. Abrams replied "Nah, he was fine". Describing filming the scene, he said "It was really chilling. Seeing these two actors [Ford and [[Adam Driver]]], they weren‚Äôt chewing up the scenery. They were just doing this thing in a way that, frankly, was disturbing. To see Harrison reach out and touch Adam. I know this sounds stupid, but literally watching it, I forgot ‚Äî I forgot that he wasn‚Äôt his son. He did it so beautifully".<ref name="ew" />

Despite the character's death, Ford commented, "‚ÄúI'm finished with ''Star Wars'' if ''Star Wars'' is finished with me. [...] I can't imagine it [being asked back]. But it is science fiction".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/harrison-ford-gq-cover-story-2017|title=Harrison Ford on Star Wars, Blade Runner, and Punching Ryan Gosling in the Face|work=GQ|first=Chris|last=Heath|date=2017-09-13|accessdate=2017-11-15}}</ref>
