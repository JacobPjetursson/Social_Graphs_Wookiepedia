'''Quiggold''' was a male [[Gabdorin]] [[pirate]] and the [[First Mate|first mate]] of Captain [[Sidon Ithano]]'s [[Sidon Ithano's crew|crew]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] in the decades after the [[Galactic Civil War]]. Assisting Ithano in the hunt for a possible lost shipment of [[kyber crystal]]s meant for Count [[Dooku]], Quiggold and the rest of the crew ended up finding a [[clone trooper]] frozen in stasis named [[CT-6116|Kix]] and locations to long-forgotten former [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist]] bases.<ref name="Lost Treasure" />

He would also accompany Captain Ithano on a visit to [[Maz Kanata's castle]] 30 years after the [[Battle of Endor]] where a fugitive [[First Order]] defector named [[Finn]] offered to join their crew in exchange for safe passage into the Outer Rim, away from the First Order's reach.<ref name="TFA">[[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']]</ref>

He wore a simple brown hood and had a peg-leg fashioned from a fuel funnel and carried a set of prayer beads fashioned from hyperdrive plotter pins.<ref name="DB" />

==Behind the scenes==
{{Quote|This one has the ability to do loads of movement performed in real time using what we call a performance delivery system, that allows the person whose operating this to act and talk and deliver a set of lines.|[[Neal Scanlan]] describes Quiggold's costume in the "Crafting Creatures" featurette|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}
Quiggold first appeared in the short story "[[The Crimson Corsair and the Lost Treasure of Count Dooku]]", which was written by [[Landry Q. Walker]] and released as the ''[[Journey to Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' multi-media campaign leading into the release of [[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']] in [[2015]]. The character then made a minor appearance in the film itself played by real-life leg amputee [[Scott Richardson]], and was controlled and voiced by key animatronic designer [[Chris Clarke]] with additional cover provided by Patrick Comerford. The mask of the Quiggold costume was an animatronic that allowed Clarke to manipulate the character's facial expression using a performance delivery system while delivering his lines. Richardson expressed interest in return for [[Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VIII ''The Last Jedi'']],<ref>[https://www.starwarsinterviews.com/sequel-trilogy/episode-vii-the-force-awakens/scott-richardson-quiggold/ Scott Richardson | Quiggold | Star Wars Interviews]</ref> but neither he nor the character returned in that film.

Quiggold appeared in the [[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']] toy line in a two-pack with [[Delphidian]] Captain [[Sidon Ithano]]. His name on the packaging was "''First Mate Quiggold''."
