[[Onaconda Farr]] was a [[Sexes|male]] [[Rodian]] [[Politics|politician]] that served as the [[Senator]] of [[Rodia]] in the last [[Standard year|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic]]. In the early [[Standard day|days]] of the [[Clone Wars]], Senator Farr felt compelled to join the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] in order to secure much needed supplies for his [[planet]]. Farr subsequently rejoined the Republic when he regretted his actions, and with the help of his friend, Senator [[Padmé Amidala]], after captured [[Viceroy of the Trade Federation]] [[Nute Gunray]]. Farr was then able to secure Republic aid for his people.

Senator Farr remained a staunch Republic loyalist for the remainder of the war and was noted for his involvement in several attempts at ending the conflict, along with a group of senators that included Padmé Amidala, [[Bail Organa]], and [[Mon Mothma]]. Farr was [[Death|murdered]] by his personal [[aide]] and Rodian [[Junior Representative|Representative]], [[Lolo Purs]] amidst a debate regarding the [[Republic military enhancement bill]], motivated by how Farr had brought war to [[Rodia]].

==Biography==
===Early years===
Onaconda Farr was a [[Sexes|male]] [[Rodian]],<ref name="Bombad Jedi" /> who by [[32 BBY]],<ref name="Atlas">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]''</ref> represented [[Rodia]] as a [[senator]] in the [[Galactic Senate]] of the [[Galactic Republic]], and was accompanied by his [[aide]]s [[Pa Dua]] and [[Tox Don]].<ref name="Episode I">[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']]</ref> He was also [[Ruwee Naberrie]]'s strongest ally in the Galactic Senate, gaining the affectionate nickname of "Uncle Ono" by Naberrie's daughter, [[Padmé Amidala]], who would become the [[Queen]] of [[Naboo]].<ref name="Episode I" />

===The invasion of Naboo===
During the [[invasion of Naboo]]<ref name="Episode I" /> in 32 BBY,<ref name="Atlas" /> Senator Farr and his aides were present in the [[Galactic Senate Chamber]] when Queen Amidala arrived on [[Coruscant]] to plead for Republic aid. After several objections to solve the incident immediately, [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Finis Valorum]] sought to send a special commission to investigate the matter. Queen Amidala, however, committed to ending the conflict on her [[homeworld]] as soon as she could, sought a [[Vote of No Confidence]] in Valorum's leadership at the behest of Naboo Senator [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]]. The vote succeeded, and in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Naboo]], Senator Palpatine won the election and became the new Supreme Chancellor of the Republic.<ref name="Episode I" />

===The Separatist Crisis===
Farr continued to serve as senator during the [[Separatist Crisis]], and by [[22 BBY]], he was present with his aides when the Senate agreed to grant Chancellor Palpatine emergency powers, allowing him to establish the [[Grand Army of the Republic]].<ref name="Episode II" />

===The Clone Wars===
As the [[Clone Wars]] erupted into a pan-[[galaxy|galactic]] conflict, Farr was present in the [[Emperor's office|office]] of the Chancellor when [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]] made contact with the Republic, pleading for aid in finding and rescuing his son, [[Rotta]] the [[Hutt]].

Some time afterward, when Farr was in Rodia, his planet was invaded by pirates and destroyed Rodia's supply ships. Afterwards, Rodia's citizens were starving without their food. Separatist leader Nute Gunray realized that this was the perfect opportunity to turn Rodia over to the Separatists. Gunray told Farr that he would supply Rodia with food, ships and protection if he joined the Separatists and he had to submit Gunray's old rival, Senator Amidala to them. Farr, determined to save his planet, agreed to Gunray's offer. He contacted Amidala and asked her if she could come personally to Rodia.

====Mission to Rodia====
After Amidala arrived at Rodia, she told Farr that she missed him. Farr then told her he thought she might not come. Amidala said that since he was an old friend, she'd always help him. Farr said that friendship he hasn't witnessed of the Republic because they didn't come to help when the pirates arrived. Amidala promised Farr he'll get his food but then Farr told Amidala about Gunray's offer. Amidala said that Gunray can't be trusted and that he will bring war to Rodia like he had created the Battle of Naboo on her home planet. Farr told her it was to late just as Separatist droids surrounded her and took her away to Rodia's prison.

Soon, Farr got the news that Gunray had arrived and that there were no sign of Amidala's friends. Thinking they fled in the jungle, Farr went to greet Gunray. As they walked to Amidala's cell, they spotted Jar Jar Binks whom they thought was a Jedi because of his cloak. Gunray ordered the droids to destroy him. But Binks got away. Later, Farr asked why the supplies hasn't arrived yet and Gunray pretends to be shocked and that his request will be taken into consideration after Amidala's execution. Farr shocked, said that wasn't part of their deal but Gunray told him to be quiet and that Rodia was now under their protection. Farr realized he'd been tricked into joining the Separatists and that the "Jedi" was their only hope.

Later, Amidala escaped from prison and started an ensuing battle. Meanwhile, Binks fell into the ocean. At some point in the battle, there was a great explosion in the ocean. Assuming Bink's dead, Amidala stopped fighting to mourn. The Separatists surrounded Amidala, to Farr's horror. Farr begged Gunray not to kill Amidala, but Gunray refused.

But Binks came up with a sea creature and defeated the Separatists. At the end of the battle, he came up with a blaster to Gunray. Gunray pleaded with Farr to shoot Binks and Amidala but Farr refused and called authorities. Farr thanked Binks and said he wasn't the wisest of foolish jedi he had ever met. Then Palpatine holographically promised Farr that he'd send supplies to Rodia.

====Skirmish aboard the Coronet====
In 21 BBY, he attended a Senate meeting and after that he exited almost immediately prior to the Mission to Cato Neimoidia.

Later, he was at a spaceport and talked with Senator Kin Robb.

Later, Satine Kryze invited Farr to join her on a voyage on the Coronet. On the Coronet, he was present when Kryze and Obi Wan Kenobi argued over Mandalore's neutrality. At dinner that very night, droids started attacking the cruiser. After hearing the news, the dinner guests and Kryze herself stood up. Kenobi defended them. At some point, he fell on the ground. After he got up, everyone had dinner again. But Kenobi decided to test the guests and see who's responsible for this skirmish. He had one of the terrorist droids in a jar and said it would try to kill everyone except its maker. They realized it was Tal Merik. Merik immediately flicked the jar and it tried to attack Kryze but Kenobi knocked it to the floor. It then tried to attack Farr but Kenobi destroyed it. Eventually, the Coronet docked at its station and all of its guests left.

After that, he walked down the halls after a Senate meeting.

Later, he was put on hostage with a group of senators in the Senate building in Coruscant by bounty hunters. But later, the bounty hunters were defeated and everyone was freed.

He was present at the Senate Building later on when it ran out of electricity.

Onaconda was present in a Senate meeting and witnessed Padmé announcing that not all Separatists are evil but all the other senators disagree. After the meeting, he accompanied Padmé and said he was sorry for her disgrace at the Senate. He, Bail Organa and Amidala decide that they should take a loan for more logistic supplies in order to gain some means of fighting the deregulation bill. But however Amidala and Farr learned that not only that the Clan is charging the Republic an extraordinarily high interest rate of 25 percent, which by itself would drain public funds for many of their social programs, but also that they are financing more than three million Separatist battle droids as well. 

That night, Farr was beaten up by Robonino and Chata Hyoki and got a broken arm in the incident, but he assures Amidala that no matter what, he'd always vote to reject the bill. Later, he congratulated Amidala on her speech.

Later, they lost one vote for no more clone troopers in the Senate. Later, Padmé gave another speech. After that, Farr greeted her.

====Death====
Mon Mothma, Purs, Farr, Organa and Amidala decided to have drinks in honor of the speech. While they were talking a private conversation, Halle Burtoni came in and started saying that for once, Amidala actually made sense. She insisted that it was private and Burtoni asked if it was Separatist conspiracy. Farr then told her to leave and as Burtoni left, she told everyone that the war won't end soon. Mothma said he's doing a great job supporting them. Farr said he's only trying to do what's right and he wished he did that long ago. But Mothma insisted he was doing it now. Then Senator Organa did a toast for victory. After that, everyone, except Purs, drank their drinks. But after Farr drank his drink, he started complaining about his heart while Amidala asked what was wrong. Farr then dropped his drink to the floor and fell down dead. Amidala held Farr while she frantically screamed for help.

===Legacy===
Following Farr's death, a [[Funeral of Onaconda Farr|funeral]] ceremony was conducted, and was attended by fellow senators, [[Jedi High Council|Jedi Council]] members, Chancellor Palpatine and [[Honor Guard]]s. In Silood's eulogy, he mentioned that Farr was a flawed man, but had never compromised his principles and always acted with his people's needs in mind. Following the [[funeral]], Senator Amidala and Purs were summoned to the Chancellor's office and were informed by [[Lieutenant]] [[Tan Divo]] that Farr was murdered by [[poison]]. During the course of Divo's official investigation, and Amidala's covert investigation, it was discovered that Purs was the [[assassin]] and was subsequently arrested after a struggle.<ref name="Senate Murders" />
