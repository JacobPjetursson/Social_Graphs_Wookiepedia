{{Quote|I'm Sidon Ithano. I don't die so easily.|The Crimson Corsair speaks|The Crimson Corsair and the Lost Treasure of Count Dooku}}
'''Sidon Ithano''', nicknamed the "'''Crimson Corsair'''", the "'''Blood Buccaneer'''", and the "'''Red Raider'''", was a [[Sexes|male]] [[Delphidian]] [[pirate]] who lived in the [[Outer Rim Territories]] in the [[Standard decade|decades]] following the conclusion of the [[Galactic Civil War]]. Ithano, who wore a distinctive [[Color|red]] [[Kaleesh]] mask, led a [[Sidon Ithano's crew|crew]] of pirates and gained a reputation as the best pirate in the region. He and his crew discovered the remains of the downed ''[[Obrexta III]]'', a ship which had been in service to the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] exactly 50 [[standard year]]s prior during the [[Clone Wars]], and raided it under the assumption that they would find valuable [[kyber crystal]]s that once belonged to [[Count]] [[Dooku]], but instead they found a [[Galactic Republic]] [[clone trooper]] named [[CT-6116|Kix]] who had been frozen in stasis&mdash;along with the location of former Separatist bases.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Sidon Ithano was a [[Sexes|male]]<ref name="Lost Treasure" /> [[Delphidian]]<ref name="Visual" /> who lived as a [[pirate]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories]] region of [[the galaxy]] during the years leading into the [[Cold war|conflict]] between the [[First Order]] and the [[Resistance]]. During this time, Ithano became the most notorious [[thief]] of his species, and he earned the title of the "[[Color|Crimson]] Corsair" due to his choice in garb: he wore crimson robes that covered most of his body and a red [[plasteel]] mask that resembled<ref name="Lost Treasure" /> that of the [[Reptile|reptilian]] [[Kaleesh]] species.<ref name="Kaleesh Databank">{{Databank|kaleesh|Kaleesh}}</ref> Ithano served alongside the [[Weequay]] pirate [[Scorza]] aboard the ''[[New Gilliland]]'', an Outer Rim-centered [[cruiser]], for several years. However, the ''New Gilliland'' was destroyed by the [[Hutt Clan|Hutt syndicate]] after Scorza [[Treason|betrayed]] Ithano and others to the [[Hutt]]s. The Corsair managed to survive the attack and even gained enough [[credit]]s to finance [[Sidon Ithano's crew|his own crew]]&mdash;though he did not invite Scorza to join him, as Scorza had betrayed him; a decision that Scorza took personally and vowed to have revenge against Ithano for.<ref name="Lost Treasure" />

Ithano's crew of pirates headquartered on the Corsair's [[starship]], the ''[[Meson Martinet]]'', which he [[captain]]ed, and in [[Unidentified derelict bar|a cantina]] on an Outer Rim [[desert]] [[planet]], [[Ponemah Terminal]]. The Corsair and his crew fought in several battles over the years, including at [[Adratharpe 7]], where Ithano [[Skirmish of Adratharpe 7|won]] much renown: he was the fiercest fighter at the battle. Ithano was also the first pirate to ever sail the [[Lost Clusters]], a treacherous location located beyond the Outer Rim. Ithano rarely spoke, relying instead on his loyal crew to know his orders by their brotherly bond or through hand gestures&mdash;which only furthered his reputation as a legendary pirate.<ref name="Lost Treasure" />

===The lost treasure of Count Dooku===
At the mark of 50 [[standard year]]s after the [[Clone Wars]], Ithano's crew consisted of [[Quiggold]], an [[Amphibian|amphibious]] [[Gabdorin]]&mdash;who was also Ithano's [[First Mate|first mate]]&mdash;the [[Ishi Tib]] [[Pendewqell]], an [[Arcona]], [[Reeg Brosna]], [[Reveth]], a female red-skinned [[Twi'lek]], and a porcine [[Gamorrean]] who went by the name of [[Squeaky (Gamorrean)|Squeaky]].<ref name="Lost Treasure" />

[[File:Sidon Ithano SWSG.png|left|thumb|200px|Captain Sidon Ithano]]
While waiting out the [[Standard day|day]] in the Ponemah cantina one day, Ithano and his six crew members received a transmission that dated back to the Clone Wars. The message was relayed from [[B1-CC14]], a [[B1 battle droid]] that was stationed aboard [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] [[cruiser]], the ''[[Obrexta III]]'', that had [[Attack in an unidentified sector|crash-landed]] on Ponemah during the Clone Wars with the treasure of [[Count]] [[Dooku]],<ref name="Lost Treasure" /> the political leader of the Separatist party,<ref name="Heroes both Sides">{{TCW|Heroes on Both Sides}}</ref> aboard. Pendewqell persuaded his [[captain]] and the crew to seek out the crashed [[cruiser]] and claim the treasure before other pirates claimed it their own, so Ithano and his crew quickly [[Race for the Lost Treasure of Count Dooku|set out]] to the southern region of the planet, known as the [[Sea of Sand]], which was plagued by lightning storms, [[magma]] geysers, and 15-[[meter]] waves of caustic sand that acted as Penohma's [[Ocean|sea]]. Consequently, starships could not fly under those conditions; so, Ithano and his crew took off in their [[sail barge]], the custom red-painted ''[[Shrike (sail barge)|Shrike]]''.<ref name="Lost Treasure" />

While journeying, Ithano's crew came to the conclusion that Dooku's treasure was the collection of [[Jedi]] [[lightsaber]] [[kyber crystal]]s that the Count<ref name="Lost Treasure" /> had collected during the Clone Wars,<ref name="Dark Disciple">''[[Dark Disciple]]''</ref> which were worth a massive fortune on the [[black market]]. However, unknown to the Corsair and his crew at the time, several other criminal gangs had taken pursuit of the ''Shrike'', including Scorza and his gang, the [[Gray Gundarks]], a [[Swoop|swoop biker]] gang.<ref name="Lost Treasure" />

The Corsair's sail barge soon entered the Sea of Sand, but a massive [[Sandstorm|sandstorm-tornado]] pulled the ''Shrike'' off-course. Ithano gestured to Quiggold, who translated the message to fire a [[kinetic disruptor]] torpedo into the tornado and thereby freeze the storm and allow them to continue on their journey. Brosna and Quiggold fired the torpedo as ordered, though it had a delayed trigger and did not immediately detonate.<ref name="Lost Treasure" />

Scorza, however, had caught up to the ''Shrike'' and fired [[Scorza's skiff|his skiff's]] [[laser cannon]]s at Ithano's vessel, which knocked Brosna overboard and did significant damage to the barge. The Corsair launched [[Magnetic harpoon|tow cable's]] onto Scorza's [[skiff]] so Scorza would have to pull them away from the tornado. However, the Gray [[Gundark]]s interrupted with their attack; firing and boarding both vessels indiscriminately. As the battle raged, a geyser of lava erupted and set many of the bikers ablaze, as well as both pirate vessels. Ithano dueled the bikers with his [[Vibroblade|vibro-sword]], until Scorza confronted him to have his revenge, shooting the two bikers with a [[blaster]] and taunting the captain with his tale of revenge. The Corsair, however, spoke, telling Scorza that he did not recognize the old Weequay pirate; Ithano had met a lot of Weequay pirates in his life. Scorza, infuriated, attacked his former friend with his sword. Ithano quickly gained the upper hand and kicked the Weequay over the railing of the ''Shrike'' just as the kinetic disruptor detonated, freezing the vortex in place like a statue. The wreckage of the ''Obrexta III'' was just on the other side of the vortex, and Ithano and his crew raced towards it, leaving their enemies to die in the flames.<ref name="Lost Treasure" />

The Corsair and his crew reached an [[airlock]] to the cruiser soon thereafter, though Ithano's crew was not the first to reach the wreckage: the bodies of the members of the [[Fangs of the Hutt]] lay dead inside the Separatist ship, [[poison]]ed by [[durilliam]] gases that had been leaking for over five decades. Ithano and his crew had come prepared, unlike the other criminals; the Corsair and his crew donned [[rebreather]]s and entered the wreckage. The cruiser was cluttered with deactivated [[battle droid]]s and corroded metal, so they stepped carefully through the maze of a ship until the reached the [[Bridge (starship)|bridge]] of the [[battleship]]. A [[ion storm]] had swept the region months before, which was causing the ship and battle droids aboard to slowly reactivate. The Corsair expressed his worriment about the danger the droids posed to Quiggold, so Quiggold questioned Pendewqell, respectively if he was an idiot for bringing the crew there&mdash;it had been Pendewqell's idea to begin the endeavor in the first place.<ref name="Lost Treasure" />

Ithano and his companions raced through the ship to find and claim the lost treasure before the droids could pose a threat. Soon after, the crew located the ship's vault and surgically opened it with blaster fire and explosives. What they found within surprised even the Corsair: A [[cryo-cycle stasis pod]] with a [[sleep]]ing being within&mdash;not lightsaber kyber crystals. Pendewqell reasoned that even though it wasn't the crystals, it had to be valuable because it was in the vault. Ithano agreed and gestured for his crew to awaken the pod. They did so, and a [[Galactic Republic]] [[clone trooper]] emerged. The [[trooper]] had learned of a [[Sith]] plot to [[Order 66|destroy]] the [[Jedi Order]] during the Clone War, but had been captured and put in [[Cryo-cycle stasis|stasis]] by Dooku before he could save the Jedi and the Republic. The trooper, [[CT-6116]], or "Kix," was a [[medic]], and he feverishly explained that he needed to save the Republic by reporting what he had learned to [[Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker]]. Before Ithano could further question the [[Cloning|clone]], Kix fell into unconsciousness.<ref name="Lost Treasure" />

Quiggold berated Pendewqell for leading them on the foolhardy treasure hunt that had led to a discovery that did not matter anymore. Pendewqell fled fearing the Corsair would punish him greatly for endangering their lives on a worthless hunt. Ithano was upset and Pendewqell's hasty departure, but told his crew to carry the unconscious clone and run for back to the ''Shrike'' as the ''Obrexta III'' began to fall apart, and the droids reactivated around them. However, Scorza emerged and pointed a blaster at the pirates, demanding they stop. Quiggold, like Ithano, did not recognize Scorza, but watched in contempt as a [[squad]] of [[B2 super battle droid]]s walked up behind Scorza and shot him; allowing Ithano and his crew to escape once more. They reached the airlock from where they had entered just in time to watch a massive [[sand worm]] devour the ''Shrike''. The Corsair was becoming exasperated at the turn of events, and at losing his sail barge. So at Quiggold's suggestion, they headed for the ''Obrexta III's'' [[escape pod]]s.<ref name="Lost Treasure" />

Only one escape pod remained active, and not everyone could fit in the pod, so Ithano selflessly stayed behind in the damned ship, and sent his crew to safety in the pod, just as a sand worm tore through the wreck, causing it to explode. Ithano survived, however, and retrieved the ''Obrexta III''{{'}}s [[Memory core/Canon|memory core]], which contained the locations of every base and droid factory the Separatists ever operated. The Corsair eventually escaped the wreckage and the Sand of Sea: three weeks after awakening Kix, the Corsair made it back to their cantina&mdash;much to the shock of everyone, though Quiggold had faithfully refused to accept that his friend had been killed. Ithano gave Kix the memory core, who assured everyone that they would be rich if they plundered the forgotten bases. Kix then joined Ithano's crew as their guide, because he was an expert in Clone Wars-era [[Grand Army of the Republic|military]] technology. Quiggold, however, inquired as to how the Crimson Corsair had escaped the fire, sand, sand worms, and droids. Ithano decided to speak, saying only that he was Sidon Ithano; and that he would not die that easily.<ref name="Lost Treasure" />

[[File:CrimsonCorsairCrewRaid.png|thumb|right|300px|Sidon Ithano's crew raiding a Separatist holdout.]]
With Kix having joined Ithano's crew, the proceeded to raid more [[Separatist holdouts]]. One was located in a misty [[swamp]], where Ithano, Reveth and Kix were ambushed by B1 battle droids, which were unearthing themselves from the ground, trying to reach the crew. [[C-3PO]] later told this story to some visitors and described it as "spooky."<ref name="Ashcan">{{IDWAdventuresCite|Ashcan|}}</ref>

===Maz Kanata's Castle===
Sometime later, Ithano and Quiggold would visit [[Maz Kanata's castle]] 30 years after the [[Battle of Endor]] where a fugitive [[First Order]] defector named [[Finn]] offered to join their crew in exchange for safe passage into the Outer Rim, away from the First Order's reach. However, before Finn made his way on board the ''Meson Martinet'', the pirates' departure was interrupted by the [[Hosnian Cataclysm|destruction of the Hosnian System]], which could be seen in the skies above [[Takodana]].<ref name="Episode VII">[[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']]</ref>
