{{Quote|But you know what I always say: Speak softly, and drive a big tank.|Hondo Ohnaka|Bounty Hunters (episode)}}
'''Hondo Ohnaka''' was a [[Sexes|male]] [[Weequay]] [[pirate]] who led the [[Ohnaka Gang]] on the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] [[Planet|world]] of [[Florrum]] during the [[Clone Wars]]. His gang was dissolved with the rise of the [[Galactic Empire]], and Hondo cast adrift as a small-time pirate and smuggler. Ultimately, he would indirectly aid the growing rebellion against the Empire, providing critical aid and intelligence at pivotal moments. Decades later, a text known as the ''[[Book of Hondo]]'' would be attributed to the famous captain.

A [[Sexes|male]] [[Weequay]]<ref name="HondoSWE" /> from the [[planet]] [[Sriluur]],<ref name="USW" /> Hondo Ohnaka was the leader of a [[pirate]] gang called the [[Ohnaka Gang]] which operated a [[Hondo's complex|base]] on the planet [[Florrum]]. He also had a pet [[Kowakian monkey-lizard]] named [[Pilf Mukmuk]].<ref name="Dooku Captured" /> At some point prior to the [[Clone Wars]], Hondo had a romantic relationship with the [[bounty hunter]] [[Aurra Sing]] but the two later separated. He was also friends with [[Jango Fett]], whom Hondo saw as an honorable man.<ref name="Lethal Trackdown">{{TCW|Lethal Trackdown}}</ref>

===Auction of Eldra Kaitis===
At some point prior to the [[Invasion of Naboo]], Hondo attended an [[Auction of Eldra Kaitis|auction]] hosted by [[Xev Xrexus]] in the [[Drazkel system]], which offered assorted illicit goods to invited buyers. The items available for purchase included several [[Droideka]]s and a captured [[Twi'lek]] [[Padawan]] named [[Eldra Kaitis]].<ref name="Maul 2">''[[Darth Maul, Part II]]''</ref> Hondo and his crew tried to capture the [[Padawan]] but failed.

===The Clone Wars===
====Capturing Dooku====
{{Quote|What to do, what to do, what to do. I don't want to kill you... per se. In fact, you seem like decent fellows, even you Count. This is just business, and once I get my money, we can go back to being friends. It's very simple. Now try not to complicate things by breaking out again.|Hondo Ohnaka to Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Count Dooku|audio=HondoWhatToDo-TGG.ogg|The Gungan General}}
[[File:Skywalker Ohnaka Kenobi.png|thumb|255x255px|right|Ohnaka converses with Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi.]]
During the Clone Wars, Hondo and his gang [[Skirmish at Vanqor|encountered]] [[Count]] [[Dooku]], the leader of the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] and a [[Sith Lord]]. Dooku was on the run from the [[Jedi Knight]]s [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Anakin Skywalker]] and had crash-landed his [[Count Dooku's Punworcca 116-class interstellar sloop|solar sailer]] on the planet [[Vanqor]], which lay a few [[parsec]]s away from Florrum. Dooku encountered Hondo and his gang salvaging his wrecked solar sailer. When Hondo offered to provide him passage offworld, Dooku accepted his offer, claiming he was above material wealth.<ref name="Dooku Captured" />

Ohnaka then transported Dooku to his base on Florrum. However, during the journey Ohnaka arranged for his Kowakian monkey-lizard Pilf to steal [[Dooku's lightsaber]], as well as [[Skywalker's lightsaber]], which Dooku had acquired during an earlier skirmish on Vanqor. Ohnaka and his men then took Dooku captive. Realizing that Count Dooku was an important Separatist leader, Ohnaka hoped that he could make a lot of money by selling Dooku to the Republic. Hondo contacted the Republic via [[hologram]] and displayed the captive Count to [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] while demanding a ransom of one million [[credit]]s worth of [[spice]]. Palpatine accepted Ohnaka's price and dispatched Kenobi and Skywalker to Florrum in order to verify the pirate's claims.<ref name="Dooku Captured" />

[[File:Hondo.jpg|thumb|left|205x205px|Ohnaka during the Clone Wars.]]
Kenobi and Skywalker arrived at Ohnaka's pirate base and were able to verify Dooku's identity. Having completed the transaction, Hondo invited his Jedi guests to banquet with his pirates. However, he drugged the two Jedi's drinks, causing them to fall unconscious.<ref name="Dooku Captured" /> Ohnaka then took his Jedi guests hostage and imprisoned them in the same cell as Dooku. He wanted to ransom Kenobi and Skywalker so that he could triple the ransom. Unaware of the recent developments on Florrum, the Republic dispatched [[Senator]] [[Kharrus]] and the [[Gungan]] [[Junior Representative|Representative]] [[Jar Jar Binks]] and a detachment of [[clone trooper]]s to deliver the spice ransom to Hondo's gang and collect Count Dooku.<ref name="The Gungan General">{{TCW|The Gungan General}}</ref>

However, unknown to Hondo, one of his pirates [[Turk Falso]] decided to double-cross his captain and steal the spice ransom for himself. Turk ordered his men to shoot down the Republic emissaries' [[Kharrus's Nu-class attack shuttle|shuttle]], causing it to crash in the [[Doshar fields]]. Senator Kharrus and the [[Clone trooper pilot|Clone pilots]], including [[Mack]] were killed during the crash but Representative Binks and several Clone troopers led by [[CC-5869|Commander Stone]] survived. While Turk's band hunted down the Republic emissaries, Turk misled Hondo by claiming that the Republic ship had been delayed. Turk's forces were later slaughtered by Binks' clone troopers, who had managed to tame several local [[skalder]]s. Turk alone survived and falsely reported to Hondo that the Republic forces had sent an army instead of the ransom. Believing Turk's lies, Hondo sent several [[WLO-5 battle tank|tanks]] to destroy the clone troopers.<ref name="The Gungan General" />

Meanwhile, Hondo had to deal with Count Dooku and his two Jedi captives who had made three escape attempts. Following the third attempt, he held Kenobi and Skywalker with electricity. On the battlefield, Hondo's tanks were defeated after Jar Jar Binks entered one of the tanks to negotiate with Turk. However, he accidentally caused the tanks to ram into each other and knock out the power grid. This caused a black-out at Hondo's pirate base which allowed his three captives to escape. Dooku killed Turk and several other pirates before fleeing in one of Hondo's starships.<ref name="The Gungan General" />

Meanwhile the Weequay pirate captain himself was captured by Kenobi and Skywalker. Despite their unpleasant experiences with Ohnaka, Kenobi ordered his former [[Padawan]] Skywalker to release Hondo since they did not want any more problems with the Ohnaka pirate gang. As a gesture of respect, Hondo ordered his forces to stand down. Praising the Jedi for their nobility, he allowed the Jedi and their clone troopers to leave his pirate base in peace. However, Kenobi warned Ohnaka that Count Dooku knew the location of his base and was not as forgiving as the Jedi.<ref name="The Gungan General" />

====Trouble on Felucia====
{{Quote|This effort is no longer... profitable!|Hondo as he retreats from [[Felucia]]|Bounty Hunters (episode)|Bounty Hunters}}
[[File:Hondo tank.png|thumb|289x289px|right|Ohnaka invades a Felucian village.]]
Following his encounter with Count Dooku and the Jedi, Hondo and the Ohnaka Gang began raiding the fungi-covered planet of [[Felucia]]. They routinely raided a [[Nysillin/Legends|nysillin]] spice village, prompting the [[Felucian]] villagers to hire a band of four bounty hunters for their protection. These four bounty hunters were named [[Sugi (bounty hunter)|Sugi]], [[Embo]], [[Rumi Paramita]], and [[Seripas]]. Shortly later, Hondo's old Jedi adversaries Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and his Padawan [[Ahsoka Tano]] visited the same village to investigate the disappearance of a Republic medical station orbiting the planet. The Jedi's arrival coincided with one of the Ohnaka gang's routine visits to the village.<ref name="Bounty Hunters">{{TCW|Bounty Hunters (episode)|Bounty Hunters}}</ref>

Hondo began demanding that the villagers deliver a portion of their nysillin by the following morning. While visiting the village, he also attempted to buy-out the bounty hunters but Sugi rejected the offer. Ohnaka then discussed a "business deal" with the Jedi Knight Kenobi, who offered to pay the Ohnaka gang to take him and his Jedi companions to a Republic outpost. However, Ohnaka declined the venture on the grounds that he did not want any Republic Credits. After issuing his ultimatum to the villages, Hondo left the village to regroup with his pirate forces. Meanwhile, the Jedi and the bounty hunters worked together to train the Felucian villages to resist Hondo and his pirate gang.<ref name="Bounty Hunters" />

[[File:Epguide217.png|thumb|256x256px|left|Ohnaka fights Skywalker in a duel.]]
Hondo sent one of his scouts to spy on the villages but the scout was killed by Embo. After the scout failed to return, Ohnaka and his pirates assaulted the village. While Hondo led the assault from the cockpit of a tank, the rest of the gang charged the village on their [[speeder bike]]s. During the ensuing [[Skirmish on Felucia|skirmish]], Hondo used his tank to blast the village from atop a cliff, wounding Embo and killing the bounty hunter Rumi. Skywalker then engaged the Weequay pirate in a duel with his lightsaber, prompting Hondo to brandish his [[electrostaff]] in defense.<ref name="Bounty Hunters" />

The Jedi eventually gained the upper hand and nearly kicked Hondo off the cliff. But Hondo managed to survive by clinging onto the ledge. Feigning submission, Ohnaka tricked Anakin into pulling him up. However, Ohnaka then attacked Skywalker and pushed him into the way of the repulsor tank's turret. While Skywalker managed to survive by jumping off the cliff before the shot hit, Hondo was able to take advantage of the chaos to make his escape, fleeing the planet and village along with his pirate gang.<ref name="Bounty Hunters" />

====Reunion with Aurra Sing====
{{Quote|Couldn't handle her, could you? Well, don't be ashamed. You're not the first man to bail out from under her command.|Hondo, to Castas, about Aurra Sing|Lethal Trackdown}}
[[File:Sing smooches Hondo.png|thumb|277x277px|right|Ohnaka is reunited with a kiss from his ex-girlfriend, Aurra Sing.]]
Later, Hondo was revisited by his former lover, the bounty hunter Aurra Sing along with her confederates [[Boba Fett]], [[Bossk]], and [[Castas]]. Aurra had become Boba's mentor and was helping the youth to hunt down and kill the [[Jedi Master]] [[Mace Windu]], who had killed his father Jango Fett during the [[Battle of Geonosis]]. She had come to seek aid and refuge from Hondo. In addition, Aurra wanted to drop off Castas on Florrum because the bounty hunter wanted to abandon the job since it had become too risky. While Hondo took his guests to a bar for drinks, Ohnaka refused to assist her and Boba with their quest but offered them indefinite stay on Florrum. Hondo was also present when Aurra executed Castas for disclosing their whereabouts to other bounty hunters.<ref name="Lethal Trackdown" />

Aurra's visit was followed by the arrival of the Jedi Master [[Plo Koon]] and Anakin's apprentice Ahsoka Tano, who had been tracking Boba Fett and his associates. Hondo informed the two Jedi that Aurra and Boba were waiting in a bar and had set trap for them. Following a brief skirmish, Aurra fled the bar in an [[airspeeder]] and was pursued by Ahsoka. After the Jedi had managed to disarm and capture Boba, Hondo managed to convince the young Fett to reveal the location of the Republic hostages [[Admiral]] [[Shoan Kilian]] and a Clone officer knowing his father would want him to. Fett complied and the Jedi were able to rescue the Republic hostages and capture Bossk. Meanwhile, Aurra attempted to escape on Boba Fett's starship ''[[Slave I]]''. However, Ahsoka damaged the starship's wing, causing it to crash.<ref name="Lethal Trackdown" /> While Aurra was presumed dead by the Jedi, Hondo secretly rescued her<ref>{{TCW|Assassin (episode)|Assassin}}</ref> and took possession of ''Slave I'' in lieu of Boba's incarceration.<ref name="A Necessary Bond">{{TCW|A Necessary Bond}}</ref>

====Delivery to Onderon====
Later in the war, Ohnaka&mdash;at the behest of the [[Jedi General]] Anakin Skywalker&mdash;delivered several [[RPS-6 rocket launcher|rocket launchers]] to [[Onderon rebels|rebel forces]] on [[Onderon]] who were [[Onderonian Civil War|fighting]] the Separatist occupation of their planet. Hondo managed to deliver the weapons to the Onderon rebels' base known as [[the nest]]. He then made a discreet retreat after Separatist droid forces showed up.<ref name="Tipping Points">{{TCW|Tipping Points}}</ref>

====Trouble with the Jedi and Grievous====
{{Quote|Hondo."<br>"General Grievous, I presume? What a surprise... have a seat."<br>"You may dispense with pleasantries, pirate. This planet is now under Separatist control!"<br>"Aha... And what do you suppose that means?"<br>"It means you have a new master, pirate scum!|Grievous and Hondo Ohnaka|A Necessary Bond}}
[[File:GrievousTossesHondo-ANB.png|thumb|266x266px|left|Grievous tosses Ohnaka onto the floor.]]
Later during the Clone Wars, Ohnaka and his pirate gang's [[Corona-class armed frigate|''Corona''-class armed frigate]] intercepted and boarded the Jedi training cruiser ''[[Crucible]]'', which was carrying the Padawan Ahsoka Tano, the [[architect droid]] [[Huyang]], the [[astromech droid]] [[R2-D2]], and six [[Jedi youngling]]s [[Petro]], [[Gungi]], [[Katooni]], [[Ganodi]], [[Byph]], and [[Zatt]]. These younglings had recently completed an initiation rite on [[Ilum]]. The Ohnaka Gang wanted to take the youngling's [[Kyber crystal]]s, which were highly prized on the black market. During the [[Raid on the Crucible|raid]], Ohnaka and his pirates used a docking tube to board the ''Crucible''. Following a struggle Huyang, R2-D2, and the younglings managed to break their ship free of the pirates and escape into space. However, Tano was sucked into the docking tube during the escape attempt and captured by Ohnaka, who regarded her as a valuable hostage.<ref name="A Test of Strength">{{TCW|A Test of Strength}}</ref>

Following the raid, Ohnaka and his gang took Ahsoka Tano to their base on Florrum. There, he taunted the [[Containment field|suspended]] Tano, and revealed that he intended to sell her to an underworld "businessman" who would pay "handsomely" for a female Jedi. He also threateningly claimed that the so-called "businessman" did not care whether Tano was delivered to him dead or alive. Later, the Ohnaka Gang was visited by a [[Preigo's Traveling World of Wonder|traveling carnival troupe]] led by the [[Dug]] manager [[Preigo]]. Unknown to Ohnaka, the six Jedi younglings had passed themselves as junior acrobats. The younglings managed to impress Ohnaka and his pirates during an entry act and subsequently convinced the drunken pirate captain to take part in the second act. While Hondo and his pirates were distracted, the youngling Katooni managed to free Tano and recover her [[lightsaber]]s. When his pirates spotted the Jedi escaping and gave chase, Ohnaka was too intoxicated to take part in the pursuit.<ref name="Bound for Rescue">{{TCW|Bound for Rescue}}</ref>

Hondo Ohnaka stayed at his pirate base while his pirates attempted to recaptured Ahsoka and her younglings in the wilderness. During this time, the pirate captain was subsequently visited by the Separatist military leader [[General]] [[Grievous]] and a droid army. Grievous opened a holo-communications channel with Count Dooku, who conferred with Hondo. In retaliation for his imprisonment during their first encounter, the Separatist leader had come to take over Florrum and to dismantle Ohanaka's arsenal. Despite his protests, Hondo was incarcerated by the Separatists who proceeded to dismantle his base and vehicles.<ref name="A Necessary Bond" />

Meanwhile, Ahsoka Tano and the younglings joined forces with the Ohnaka gang to rescue Hondo and to fight the Separatists. While R2-D2 distracted the Separatist droids with the pirate's tank, Ahsoka, the younglings and several of the pirates made their way into the pirate base and found Hondo's cell. With the encouragement of Hondo, the youngling Katooni managed to correctly assemble her lightsaber and free Hondo from his cell. After freeing the remaining pirates, Hondo and his Jedi rescuers managed to escape the prison section before it was levelled by Separatist [[Tank (vehicle)|tanks]].<ref name="A Necessary Bond" />

During their escape, Ohnaka and his pirates attempted to flee the planet but the youngling Katooni managed to appeal to his sense of honor. Flying the repaired ''Slave I'', Hondo managed to rescue Ahsoka and the remaining younglings from General Grievous, and together the surviving pirates and the Jedi escaped to a nearby Republic cruiser, where they were picked up by General Kenobi. When confronted by Kenobi about the attack on the ''Crucible'', Hondo claimed that it was a rescue mission. Kenobi decided not to punish Hondo and the Ohnaka gang due to the assistance they had provided Tano and the younglings. Hondo departed but not before giving Katooni a final nod of approval for her actions on Florrum.<ref name="A Necessary Bond" />

====Attack of the Nightbrothers====
{{Quote|Filth, you will pay for your insolence."<br />"Insolence! We are pirates! We don't even know what that means. Open fire!|Darth Maul and Hondo Ohnaka|Revival (episode)}}
[[File:HondosPoopStainedShoulder-R.png|thumb|right|261x261px|Hondo and Pilf Mukmuk during their skirmish with Darth Maul and Savage Opress.]]
Hondo encountered a new challenge in the form of the resurgent Sith Lord [[Maul|Darth Maul]] and his brother [[Savage Opress]], who attempted to recruit Ohnaka's gang into an army that would serve the brothers. The [[Nightbrothers]] managed to lure several of the Ohnaka Gang aboard their starship and managed to bribe two [[captain]]s into flipping sides. Those that remained loyal to Hondo including one captain were executed by the two Nightbrothers. Hondo witnessed the execution via hologram. Under the leadership of Darth Maul and Savage Oppress, the turncoat pirates then launched an attack on Ohnaka's base on Florrum and claimed it for their own.<ref name="Revival">{{TCW|Revival (episode)|Revival}}</ref>

[[File:Ohnaka pirate gang.png|thumb|left|264x264px|Ohnaka and his gang open fire against the Nightbrothers.]]
Fortunately for Hondo, he received reinforcements in the form of the Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and the Jedi Master [[Adi Gallia]]. Together with these Jedi reinforcements, Hondo and his pirates resisted the Nightbrothers' onslaught. During the fighting, Gallia was killed by Opress. Outnumbered, Hondo, his pirates, and Kenobi were forced to retreat back to the base. Under Kenobi's orders, Hondo and his men collapsed a section of a tunnel with explosives to separate Kenobi and the Nightbrothers from the pirates. While being pursued by the turncoat pirates, Hondo used a large blaster cannon to convince his former associates to renounce their alliance with the Sith and to join forces in driving Maul and Opress offworld. Together, they forced the two Nightbrothers into a retreat and destroyed their ship. However, the two Sith managed to escape into space on an escape vessel. In the aftermath of the [[Skirmish on Florrum|skirmish]], Hondo and his men pillaged the wreckage of Maul and Opress' starship.<ref name="Revival" />

===Age of the Empire===
====Fall of the Ohnaka Gang====
At some point after the [[Proclamation of the New Order|rise]] of the [[Galactic Empire]] and the fall of the Republic, the Imperials broke up the Ohnaka Gang, forcing Hondo Ohnaka to continue his life of piracy alone. At some unknown point, Ohnaka antagonized the [[Rang Clan]], causing the clan to place a [[bounty]] on his head.<ref name="Brothers of the Broken Horn">{{Rebels|Brothers of the Broken Horn}}</ref>

====Skirmish on Ord Mantell====
[[File:Hondo and Qi'ra.JPG|thumb|right|229x229px|Qi'ra as a prisoner of Hando and IG-88 before able to trick them.]]
At some point following [[13 BBY]],<ref name="Official Guide">''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story The Official Guide]]''</ref> Hondo teamed up with [[IG-88]] to collect the bounty on [[Qi'ra]],<ref name="Triplecross">{{FOD|Triplecross}}</ref> a [[lieutenant]] in [[Dryden Vos]]' crime syndicate, [[Crimson Dawn]].<ref name="Official Guide" /> After a brief chase through the streets of [[Ord Mantell]], the two were able to capture her. Eventually though, Qi'ra was able to trick Hondo and IG-88 into turning on each other, allowing her to capture them and collect the bounties on both of their heads.<ref name="Triplecross" />

====Meeting the Spectres====
{{Quote|You lied to me? I knew I liked you!|Hondo Ohnaka to Ezra Bridger|Brothers of the Broken_Horn}}
In [[4 BBY]], Hondo Ohnaka took over the [[Devaronian]] [[crime lord]] [[Cikatro Vizago]]'s starship, the ''[[Broken Horn]]''. During the struggle, Ohnaka managed to disable Vizago's [[IG-RM bodyguard and enforcer droid|bodyguard droids]] by stealing his droid controller and imprisoned the Devaronian in a cell aboard the ship's brig. However, Vizago managed to send a distress signal before his capture that was picked up by [[Ezra Bridger]] and the astromech droid [[C1-10P|Chopper]], who were members of the [[Spectres]]. The two rebels were cleaning the rebel starship ''[[Ghost]]'' which was parked on the planet [[Garel]]. Hearing Vizago's distress, Ezra and Chopper traveled on the ''[[Phantom]]'' and found the ''Broken Horn'' in orbit above Garel.<ref name="Brothers of the Broken Horn" />

[[File:Brothers of the Broken Horn thumb.jpg|thumb|236x236px|left|Ohnaka works alongside Ezra Bridger.]]
The two rebels boarded the ''Broken Horn'' and encountered Ohnaka in the ship's bridge. When questioned by Ezra, Hondo claimed that he had won the ''Broken Horn'' in a game of [[sabacc]] with Vizago. Not wanting to reveal his true identity, Ezra introduced himself as the smuggler and galactic entrepreneur [[Lando Calrissian]]. Shortly later, the ''Broken Horn'' was spotted and attacked by an Imperial warship. However, Ohnaka and his new-found rebel partners managed to escape due to the quick actions of Ezra and Chopper, who managed to power up the engines and make a jump into [[hyperspace]]. Impressed, Hondo offered Ezra the chance to assist him in selling five power generators at extortion rates. In the end, the two partners agreed to split their profits and to give Ezra two of the power generators. Not trusting Ohnaka fully, Ezra stole the pirate's droid controller and secretly handed it to Chopper for safekeeping.<ref name="Brothers of the Broken Horn" />

Hondo and his new-found partners traveled to the frigid planet [[Nixus]] where they planned to sell the power generators to an unknown buyer at [[Nixus Hub 218]]. Upon landing at Nixus Hub 218, Ohnaka and Ezra discovered that their buyer was the [[Jablogian]] crime lord [[Azmorigan]]. Azmorigan was aware that the Rang Clan had placed a bounty on Ohnaka's head and he also recognized Ezra as one of the rebels who had helped Calrissian. Seeking revenge against both Hondo and Ezra for past wrongs, Azmorigan had them hoisted onto a loading dolly which would then catapult them into [[Realspace|space]]. Azmorigan also planned to seize their power generators for himself. Before Azmorigan could exact his revenge, he was foiled by Chopper, who attacked him and his men. During the ensuing [[Skirmish in Nixus Hub 218|skirmish]], Oanaka and his rebel allies managed to turn the tables on Azmorigan and escape offworld with the generators and several stolen credits. Hondo also realized that Ezra was a Jedi after the youth wielded a [[Ezra's lightsaber|lightsaber]] and used [[the Force]] to stop the dolly from hurling him into space.<ref name="Brothers of the Broken Horn" />

After escaping Nixus, Hondo and his rebel partners traveled back to Garel on the ''Broken Horn'' with the generators. When Ezra revealed his true identity and confided that he was feeling overwhelmed by his responsibilities to the rebellion and his [[Jedi]] training, Ohnaka suggested that the boy could become a "pirate Jedi." Shortly later, Ezra and Chopper traveled down to the ship's brig where they discovered a captive Vizago. Vizago revealed that Hondo had actually shot him in the back with a stun gun and disabled his droids before seizing control of his ship. The two rebels freed Vizago and together they confronted Ohnaka on the bridge. While Ezra proposed that the two criminals split their profits and let him keep the generators, Vizago took the opportunity to snatch back his droid controller and order his droids to attack the intruders. Ohnaka managed to flee on the ''Phantom'', taking the five power generators with him.<ref name="Brothers of the Broken Horn" />

Unknown to Hondo, the ''Phantom{{'s}}'' [[autopilot]] had already been programmed to return to her mothership, the ''Ghost''. Hondo landed in a [[spaceport]] in [[Garel City]] where he was surrounded by the other crew of the ''Ghost'' including the ship's captain [[Hera Syndulla]] and Ezra's master [[Kanan Jarrus]]. Shortly later, Ohnaka was rejoined by Ezra and Chopper, who had returned to Garel in an [[escape pod]]. The rebels allowed Hondo to keep his credits but seized the five power generators, which were used to alleviate an energy crisis on the planet [[Rinn]].<ref name="Brothers of the Broken Horn" />

====The Lasat refugees====
In [[3 BBY]], Hondo contacted Ezra via a [[transmitter]] and told him to travel to Nixus Hub 218, where the Empire had captured two [[refugee]]s. Ezra and the crew of the ''Ghost'' traveled to Nixus where they discovered that these two refugees were [[Lasat]] who has survived the [[Siege of Lasan|fall]] of [[Lasan]]. The rebels managed to overpower their Imperial captors and rescue the refugees, who introduced themselves as the former [[Lasan High Honor Guard]] [[Gron]] and the female mystic [[Chava|Chava the Wise]]. This development both delighted and unnerved [[Garazeb Orrelios]], the sole Lasat member of the crew of the ''Ghost'' who had believed that he was the last of his species. After the rescue, Ohnaka introduced himself as Ezra's mysterious contact and revealed that he had also tipped off the Empire to the refugees' arrival knowing that the rebels would arrive to save the day.<ref name="Legends of the Lasat">{{Rebels|Legends of the Lasat}}</ref>

[[File:Hondo captured.jpeg|thumb|246x246px|right|Ohnaka speaks to the Ghost Crew through a hologram after being captured by the Empire.]]
With Imperial reinforcements bound to show up, the rebels began their return trip to the ''Ghost''. When Ohnaka demanded the payment that he was owed, Ezra refused, making the Weequay pirate very proud of his young friend. After the rebels had left, Hondo was cornered by several [[stormtrooper]]s. Always one to make a profit and double-cross his friends to save himself, Ohnaka led the Imperial troopers to the rebels, who were making their way through the halls of Hub 218. These stormtroopers were serving under the [[Imperial Security Bureau]] [[Agent]] [[Alexsandr Kallus|Kallus]], a perennial foe of the Spectres, who ordered his men to seize them alive. Before the Imperials could capture the rebels, Ohnaka secretly contacted Ezra and warned him of the approaching Imperials.<ref name="Legends of the Lasat" />

The stormtroopers engaged the crew of the ''Ghost'' in a fire fight within the halls of Nixus Hub 218. To help his rebel partners, Hondo secretly sealed several of the doors, preventing many of the stormtroopers from pursuing the rebels. Ohnaka's actions enabled the rebels to flee aboard the ''Ghost'' and escape into hyperspace. However, Hondo was not so lucky and he was captured by the stormtroopers. Ohnaka was then forced to help the Kallus and Admiral [[Kassius Konstantine]] hunt down the rebels. Due to a tracker planted in the transmitter which he had used to contact Ezra, the Imperials were able to track down the rebel ship ''Ghost'' to an unstable [[star cluster]] in [[Wild Space]].<ref name="Legends of the Lasat" />

When the ''Ghost'' began penetrating the unstable star cluster, Hondo marveled that the rebels were trying a dangerous feat. This prompted Kallus to respond that they believed that they could. With Kallus' Imperial cruiser unable to follow the ''Ghost'' into the star cluster, Hondo remarked that Kallus should wait to catch them the next time. Kallus then responded that the rebels would be destroyed by the gravitational pull of the star cluster. Despite the odds, the rebels and the Lasat refugees managed to navigate safely through the maze due to Zeb's [[bo-rifle]]. They then rediscovered the legendary Lasat homeworld of [[Lira San]], which was already populated by millions of Lasat and became a refuge for the two Lasat refugees.<ref name="Legends of the Lasat" />

====Heist at Reklam Station====
[[File:Reclem station hologram.jpg|thumb|left|252x252px|Hondo gives the Phoenix and Spectres Reklam Station]]
Following the events on Nixus Hub 218, Hondo was imprisoned by the Empire at the [[Naraka prison|Imperial prison]] on [[Naraka]]. He shared his cell with the [[Ugnaught]] laborer [[Terba]], who had been imprisoned for trying to escape the Imperial junkyard [[Reklam Station]] inside the planet [[Yarma]]. Reklam Station was being used to dismantle several decommissioned Republic [[starfighter]]s including [[BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber|Y-wing starfighters]]. Seeking pecuniary reward and to escape the prison, Terba related the information to Hondo. Hondo then convinced the Spectres particularly his former one-time partner Ezra Bridger to rescue him in return for disclosing this valuable information. In [[2 BBY]], Ezra and his fellow rebels staged a [[Rescue of Hondo Ohnaka|rescue]] and managed to evacuate Hondo. However, Terba was killed during the escape attempt when he separated from the rebels after Hondo refused to give him a double share.<ref name="Steps">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Steps Into Shadow]]''</ref>

After his escape, Hondo accompanied the Spectres back to [[Chopper Base]] on the planet [[Atollon]]. There, he tried to convince Hera to sell him the ''Ghost'' but was rebuffed by the rebel captain. Hondo then reiterated his demand for a ship equipped with a [[hyperdrive]], detachable cargo bay, [[Deflector shield generator|shield generator]], and a crew. In response, the [[Phoenix Cell]]'s [[Commander]] [[Jun Sato]] reminded the pirate that he would be paid only if his information was useful. Hondo then informed the rebels about Reklam Station and the Y-wings being dismantled there. At the urging of the former [[Clone Captain]] [[Rex]] and Ezra, Hera agreed to send a reconnaissance mission there to investigate Hondo's claims.<ref name="Steps" />

Hondo and Ezra's team including Rex traveled to Yarma in the [[VCX-series auxiliary starfighter|assault shuttle]] ''Phantom''. Since they could not travel there directly the ''Phantom'' exited hyperspace at [[Sereeda Waypoint]]. Hondo warned them that it was not a good idea since Sereeda was located in [[Mining Guild]] space. As Hondo had forewarned, the ''Phantom'' was intercepted by a Mining Guild patrol. Following a brief dogfight, the rebels fled into hyperspace and reached Yarma. Hondo then guided Sabine to Reklam Station, which lay inside the [[gas]]sy planet's [[atmosphere]]. On the way, the rebels were ambushed by two [[DTS-series Dismantler Droid]]s but managed to shoot them down. Despite being hit, Sabine managed to land the ''Phantom'' beneath one of the [[orbit]]al station's platforms.<ref name="Steps" />

After boarding the station, Hondo and the rebels encountered several Ugnaught laborers including [[Melch]]. While Ezra wanted to ignore them, Hondo spoke to the Ugnaughts and told them that he was Terba's friend and that the rebels had come to liberate them. Ezra then asked Hondo to convince Melch to shut down the conveyor belt. Following a [[Mission to Reklam Station|skirmish]] with Imperial stormtroopers and dismantler droids, the rebels, Hondo and the Ugnaughts managed to steal five Y-wings. Hondo and the Ugnaughts followed Ezra to the command center but stopped to guard an [[Sentinel-class landing craft|Imperial landing craft]] in the [[hangar]]. After the station began to collapse, Hondo and his Ugnaught allies took the shuttle and fled offworld. Before leaving, Hondo contacted Ezra to thank him and his friends for rescuing him.<ref name="Steps" />

When Ezra was later captured by the Imperial [[Viceroy]] [[Gar Saxon]] during a [[Mission to the third moon of Concord Dawn|mission]] to the [[Third moon of Concord Dawn|third moon]] of [[Concord Dawn]], Ezra claimed that he worked as part of Hondo's scavenging party. However, Saxon was not fooled and continued interrogating his prisoner.<ref name="ISC">{{Rebels|Imperial Super Commandos}}</ref>

====Theft of the Argora====
[[File:Hondo & Argora.jpg|thumb|245x245px|right|Hondo with the Argora as he meets up with the Spectres]]
Hondo then tipped off Ezra about the rare creature, the [[Argora]], being held a [[Class four container transport|Class ''four'' container transport]] that acted as the Emperor's [[Emperor's personal zoo|personal zoo]]. Hondo then boarded the transport where he found the Argora. Unfortunately, Hondo did not know which crate the Argora was in and inadvertently released the other captive creatures. As Hondo made his way to escape the creatures, he ran into the Spectres. At first, Hondo refused to hand the Argora over to them and told them that they had other things to worry about than stormtroopers.<ref name="Endangered 1">{{IDWAdventuresCite|7|[[Endangered, Part 1]]}}</ref>

As the creatures approached both Hondo and the Spectres, he then tried to make his escape. Hondo was then chased by Ezra, who demanded Hondo to surrender the Argora. Unfortunately, Hondo and Ezra were then confronted by stormtroopers under Dr. [[Hazlekk]] and Captain [[Zarda]]. As the stormtroopers prepared to fire, Hondo again made his escape when the rest of the Spectres arrived. Hondo and Ezra then worked together in trapping Hazlekk, Zarda and their stormtroopers behind a [[force field]]. Hondo then tried to make off with the Argora, but Ezra released it. Hondo then came under attack from it and decided to give it to the rebels. Hondo then boarded the [[Last Chance|''Last Chance'']] and left.<ref name="Endangered 2">{{IDWAdventuresCite|8|[[Endangered, Part 2]]}}</ref>

====Treasure hunting on Wynkahthu====
[[File:Wynkahthu recovery team.jpeg|242x242px|thumb|left|Hondo, Melch, Azmorigan, and the Spectres]]
Later, Hondo struck a business partnership with the Jablogian crime lord Azmorigan, who had acquired the flight plan for an Imperial cargo ship. Azmorigan had learned that the cargo ship was carrying treasures and [[proton bomb]]s. The two partners and Hondo's Ugnaught crew ambushed the cargo ship near the planet [[Wynkahthu]]. However, the cargo ship drifted into the planet's stormy upper atmosphere. Hondo sent his Ugnaught crew to board the ship but most of them were lost due to the dangerous windy conditions. Only Melch survived the boarding and Hondo abandoned his last crew member to his fate.<ref name="The Wynkahthu Job">{{Rebels|The Wynkahthu Job}}</ref>

With their plan in tatters, Hondo contacted his old friend Ezra Bridger and solicited the help of his rebel cell. While Hera was opposed to working with Hondo and Azmorigan due to their negative past encounters, she agreed to commit her crew and ship ''Ghost'' after learning that the cargo ship contained proton bombs, which the rebellion desperately needed. Following some discussion, Hondo and Azmorigan agreed to split the treasure while the rebels obtained the proton bombs. After assessing the situation, the rebels decided to board the cargo ship by leaping on its hull and then opening the cargo bay. They would load the cargo onto the ship by firing grappling guns.<ref name="The Wynkahthu Job" />

When the rebel recovery team assembled in the ''Ghost''{{'s}} cargo bay, Hondo tried to dissuade Azmorigan from coming by claiming that the recovery mission was too arduous for the frail Jablogian. However, Azmorigan insisted on coming along and threatened not to let the mission go ahead unless he came. After leaping onto the hull, Hondo, Azmorigan and the Spectres led by Zeb managed to find a manhole which led inside the ship. Hondo soon encountered Melch, who attacked him for abandoning him. At the urging of Zeb, Hondo admitted that he had contracted the rebels after losing his Ugnaught crew. Hondo managed to win Melch over by offering him a two percent share of the treasure.<ref name="The Wynkahthu Job" />

While Zeb was angry at Hondo's deception, Ezra tried to defend him by claiming he at least told half the truth. Hondo, Azmorigan, and the rebels managed to enter the cargo bay with the help of Chopper and Ezra. Once inside, Hondo and Azmorigan squabbled over the treasure while the rebels began preparations to load the proton bombs aboard the ''Ghost''. Using grappling guns, they managed to fire two cables onto the ''Ghost''. The rebels used the cables to tow the proton bombs aboard the ''Ghost''.<ref name="The Wynkahthu Job" />

After Hondo tried to load one of his treasures with Ezra's help, Zeb objected and reminded Hondo that the rebels got to load their weapons first. After Azmorigan disappeared and Zeb vanished while trying to find him, Ezra tried to ask Hondo for help but the Weequay pirate was more concerned about his share of the treasure. Hondo also told Ezra that Azmorigan was his business partner and acquaintance. As a result, Ezra realized that Hondo only cared for himself.    Ezra subsequently discovered that Zeb and Azmorigan had been locked in the brig by an [[Imperial sentry droid]]. He managed to free them but the rebels and Azmorigan were pursued by more sentry droids.<ref name="The Wynkahthu Job" />

When Ezra and the others returned to the cargo bay with sentry droids behind them, Hondo and Melch were attempting to load a crate onto the cables. Ezra told them to get ready to leave but Hondo insisted on taking the treasure. Amidst the confusion, Melch hid inside a crate; not trusting Hondo to save him. Hondo was unconcerned about Melch's disappearance and claimed that he had fallen to his death. Hondo and Azmorigan raced each other on the cables back to the ''Ghost'' while clutching to their cargo. Chopper, Ezra, and Zeb followed soon. The Imperial cargo ship then fell into the vortex and exploded, destroying everything aboard.<ref name="The Wynkahthu Job" />

Back aboard the ''Ghost'', Hondo and Azmorigan fought over a chest only to discover a hidden Melch inside. While Hondo was disappointed at not getting his share of the treasure, he claimed to have learned the value of friendship. Melch punched him in the chest to indicate that he did not trust Hondo's words. Hera then ordered Hondo and his associates to continue their conversation on their stolen Imperial landing craft.<ref name="The Wynkahthu Job" />

===Alliance to Restore the Republic===
====Returning Ezra a favour====
[[File:Hondo Ohnaka Friend for Hire Smuggler Leader ToL.png|left|thumb|220px|Hondo Ohnaka]]
At the request of Hera Syndulla, the bounty hunter [[Ketsu Onyo]] located Hondo and Melch on the planet [[Seelos]], where they were staying with the former [[Clone commando]]s [[CC-5576-39|Gregor]] and [[CC-3636|Wolffe]]. Hondo and the others present when at the modified [[All Terrain Armored Transport (early rebellion against the Empire)|AT-AT walker]] [[Joopa Base]] when Hera and Rex arrived on the ''Ghost''. Hera had come to recruit Hondo and the others to help Ezra [[Liberation of Lothal|liberate]] his homeworld of [[Lothal]] from the Empire. While Hondo agreed with Wolffe that they had little chance of prevailing against the Empire, he admired Ezra's courage and said that there was nothing he would not do for the boy.<ref name="A Fool's Hope">{{Rebels|A Fool's Hope}}</ref>

During their journey to Lothal, Hondo convinced Hera to latch the ''Ghost'' onto the hull of a cargo ship in order to slip through the Imperial blockade of Lothal. Despite the misgivings of Hera and Kallus about his plan, the other rebels placed their trust on Hondo and latched onto the cargo ship once it had exited hyperspace. Hondo's ploy worked and the rebels were able to enter Lothal's atmosphere undetected. Upon arriving above the [[Lothal cliff dwelling]], Hondo and Melch helped the rebels to route [[Governor]] [[Arihnda Pryce]]'s attack force by shooting down two Imperial [[LAAT/le gunship|patrol transports]].<ref name="A Fool's Hope" />

Following the battle, Hondo along with Melch and Ketsu met up with Ezra. When Hondo asked if he could take his leave, Ezra told him that their struggle was not over until they expelled the Empire from Lothal and showed that the Imperials could be defeated.<ref name="A Fool's Hope" />

====Liberation of Lothal====
Following the skirmish at the Lothal cliff-dwelling, Hondo took part in the Rebels' attack on the [[Imperial Complex (Lothal)|Imperial Complex]], a mobile [[Imperial Planetary Occupation Facility]]. As part of their plan, the rebels used an unwilling Pryce to gain landing rights at the Dome. Hondo and Melch helped to capture the command center by distracting the officers and stormtroopers inside long enough for the other rebels to storm the room and force their surrender.<ref name="Family Reunion – & Farewell">{{Rebels|Family Reunion – and Farewell}}</ref>

After using a faux [[Protocol 13]] to evacuate the entire Imperial garrison aboard the "Dome", the rebels tried to fire up the Dome's engines only to be blocked by Grand Admiral Thrawn's Star Destroyer ''[[Chimaera]]''. Thrawn managed to force Ezra to come to him to discuss an unconditional surrender by bombing Capital City. In Ezra's absence, the rebels adopted Sabine's plan to send two strike teams to recapture the power terminals that powered the Dome's deflector shield generator.<ref name="Family Reunion – & Farewell" />

While Melch pursued stormtroopers, Hondo joined Rex and Ketsu Onyo as Team A to secure the north tower's power terminal. Despite fierce resistance, the rebels managed to capture the power terminal. Hondo took out several of the stormtroopers when he thought Melch was killed. He then discovered that Melch had only been stunned. Shortly later, the rebels managed to raise the Dome's deflector shields before the ''Chimaera'' was able to restart their bombardment of the capital.<ref name="Family Reunion – & Farewell" />

After Ezra managed to summon a pod of [[purrgil]] to carry himself, Thrawn, and the ''Chimaera'' into the depths of space, the rebels were able to launch the Dome into Lothal's upper atmosphere. Hondo and the other rebels managed to escape before detonating the Dome, which wiped out the Imperial garrison on Lothal. This ended Imperial rule on the planet.<ref name="Family Reunion – & Farewell" />

===Galactic Civil War===
[[File:Hondo Ohnaka SWA.png|right|thumb|228x228px|Hondo Ohnaka, during the Galactic Civil War]]
Sometime after the [[Battle of Yavin]], [[Saponza]], together with [[Saponza's partner|his partner]], accepted a contract with Hondo, who had been watching Saponza's partner's work. The business venture involved undertaking various important jobs for a means of profit.<ref name="Commander">''[[Star Wars: Commander]]''</ref>

===Cold war===
During the era of the [[cold war]] between the [[First Order]] and the [[Resistance]], Hondo made a deal with [[Chewbacca]] on the planet [[Batuu]] to use the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' in his latest endeavor.<ref name="SW:GE">[[Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge|''Star Wars'': Galaxy's Edge]]</ref> While on Batuu at [[Black Spire Outpost]], Hondo frequently recounted tales of besting a Jedi. During this time, an individual learned that Hondo had the ''Millennium Falcon'' and informed the [[mercenary]] [[Bazine Netal]], who was on a mission to find the legendary [[starship]]. After learning of the ''Falcon''{{'s}} apparent whereabouts, Netal departed for Batuu to find Ohnaka.<ref name="LandoLuck">''[[Lando's Luck]]''</ref>

===First Order-Resistance war===
By the time of the [[Battle of Crait]], a decisive confrontation of the [[First Order–Resistance war]], Ohnaka was stationed at Black Spire Outpost. Shortly after the battle, the ''Millennium Falcon'' deactivated its hyperdive and landed on Batuu, where its crew, the remaining members of the Resistance, got involved in one of Ohnaka's endeavors.<ref name="Flight Falcon">''[[:File:Landos_Luck_Flight_of_the_Falcon.png|Flight of the Falcon]]'' promotional</ref>

===Legacy===
{{Quote|Do not wait for opportunity to strike. Steal it instead!|From the ''Book of Hondo''|The Crimson Corsair and the Lost Treasure of Count Dooku}}
Decades after the [[Battle of Endor]], the ''[[Book of Hondo]]'' would be attributed to the pirate.<ref name="Crimson Corsair">"[[The Crimson Corsair and the Lost Treasure of Count Dooku]]"</ref>

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|You don't survive in the Outer Rim by being stupid!|Hondo Ohnaka|Dooku Captured}}
Hondo Ohnaka was a self-centered, avaricious pirate who was solely concerned with getting the best business deal for himself. His avarice led him to kidnap and ransom several high profile prisoners during the Clone Wars including Count Dooku, and the Jedi Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Ahsoka Tano. These characteristics occasionally brought him into trouble with the Jedi, the Republic, the Separatists, and even his own men who attempted to emulate his behavior to advance their own interests.<ref name="Dooku Captured" /><ref name="The Gungan General" /><ref name="A Test of Strength" /> Ohnaka carried his avaricious and treacherous nature into the [[Imperial Era|Age of the Empire]] by exploiting and betraying several "business partners" he collaborated with including Cikatro Vizago, Ezra Bridger and the Lasat refugees Chava and Gron.<ref name="Brothers of the Broken Horn" /><ref name="Legends of the Lasat" />

[[File:Chewbacca Hondo SWGE.jpg|thumb|left|249x249px|Hondo makes a deal with Chewbacca]]
Despite his avarice and treacherous nature, Ohnaka was still capable of honor and courage.<ref name="Lethal Trackdown" /> On one occasion, he successfully convinced the young bounty hunter Boba Fett to reveal the location of two Republic hostages by telling Boba that it was the honorable thing to do, and what Jango would have done. On a later occasion, he joined forces with his former Jedi prisoner Ahsoka and several Jedi younglings to fight off General Grievous and his droid forces. Ohnaka admired the courage and devotion of the Jedi younglings particularly the youngling Katooni.<ref name="A Necessary Bond" /> Ohnaka also had a reputation as a reliable businessman who kept his word. He honored his promise to deliver several rocket launchers to General Skywalker's beleaguered Republic forces on Onderon.<ref name="Tipping Points" /> And, despite selling out the Rebels for a profit, Ohnaka didn't run off immediately. He warned Ezra of the incoming stormtroopers and helped the Rebels escape. This showed that even though Ohnaka wanted to make a profit, he still didn't want any harm to come to Ezra.<ref name="Legends of the Lasat" />

[[File:HondoPortraitBFII.png|thumb|right|194x194px|A portrait of Hondo in [[Maz Kanata's castle]] on [[Takodana]]]]
Hondo Ohnaka also had a romantic relationship with the bounty hunter Aurra Sing, whom he secretly rescued after her ship had been shot down by Jedi forces.<ref name="Lethal Trackdown" /> In addition, Hondo could speak [[Ugnaught (language)|Ugnaught]] which helped him to befriend several Ugnaught laborers including Terba. He used his command of the Ugnaught language to convince the Ugnaught laborers at Reklam Station to help the rebels steal Y-wing starfighters and to accept him as their leader. Ohnaka was also skilled at linking other people's interests to his own goals and ambitions. He sold the Phoenix Group information about Y-wing starfighters at Reklam Station in return for gaining a ship and crew. In the end, the rebels did not have to pay Hondo directly because he found a ship and crew at Reklam Station himself.<ref name="Steps" />

Ohnaka was also known for his flowery rhetoric and liked to refer to his Ugnaught crew as his "short, fragrant family." While he claimed to regard his Ugnaught crew as his family, Ohnaka was not above abandoning them when danger arose. Ohnaka's betrayal angered Melch, who attacked him. However, Ohnaka managed to placate the Ugnaught by offering him a two percent share of the treasure. While Bridger respected Ohnaka as a tricky but friendly business partner, Hera Syndulla and Kanan Jarrus regarded him as a slippery and untrustworthy character. While Ohnaka claimed to care for his "partners", he was known to put his pecuniary interests ahead of others; as exemplified by his exploitative attitude towards Azmorigan.<ref name="The Wynkahthu Job" />

While Hondo thought that Ezra had little chance of success in liberating Lothal, he admired the boy's spirit and courage. Hondo's respect for Ezra led him to return the youth a favor by volunteering to assist in the planet's liberation.<ref name="A Fool's Hope" /> Despite dominating Melch in their relationship, Hondo regarded him as a friend. He was distraught when he taught Melch had been killed and shot several stormtroopers in rage. However, Hondo was elated when he discovered his friend had merely been stunned and quipped that Melch should not strive to be a hero; reflecting his sarcastic sense of humor.<ref name="Family Reunion – & Farewell" />

A notable trait of Ohnaka's business conduct was his distrust for hard currency. He preferred payment in expensive trade goods, such as spice<ref name="Dooku Captured" /><ref name="The Gungan General" /> or [[Nysillin]].<ref name="Bounty Hunters" />

By 2 BBY, Hondo Ohnaka was aging and his hair had turned gray.<ref name="The Wynkahthu Job" />

==Skills and abilities==
Hondo Ohnaka was a competent and able leader who was able to keep his men in check and to lead the Ohnaka Gang on salvaging and raiding expeditions. During a skirmish on Felucia, Hondo showed a reasonable understanding of battle tactics. He was also skilled enough to handle an electrostaff in combat and managed to put up a decent fight against the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, though he was ultimately outfought.<ref name="Bounty Hunters" /> In addition, Ohnaka was also able to take on numerous opponents and fought several [[battle droid]]s with a [[blaster]] and [[cutlass]].<ref name="Revival" /> On a later occasion, Ohnaka managed to outwit the crime lord Vizago and his body guards and seize control of his ship, the ''Broken Horn''.<ref name="Brothers of the Broken Horn" />
