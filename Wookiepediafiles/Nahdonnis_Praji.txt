{{Quote|Delusions of grandeur, hah! I'd always thought that was just a figure of speech, just a needlessly pejorative bit of language contrived by lesser minds that couldn't find a better way to describe the aspirations of truly great men.|Governor-General Praji|Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Praji}}
'''Nahdonnis Praji''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Sexes/Legends|male]] born to the wealthy [[House Praji]] on the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]] during the waning [[Standard year/Legends|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]]. Sometime around the year [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], Praji joined the newly [[Declaration of a New Order|formed]] [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire's]] [[Imperial Navy/Legends|navy]] and became an honored graduate of the [[Academy of Carida|Imperial Academy]] on the planet [[Carida/Legends|Carida]]. He participated in various Imperial campaigns, such as the [[Battle of Almak|subjugation of Almak]]. During the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], Praji led [[Troop/Legends|troops]] against [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] cells in the battles of [[Attack at Datar|Datar]] and [[Battle of Nar Shaddaa (Galactic Civil War)|Nar Shaddaa]]. Because of his actions, Praji became [[Sith Lord/Legends|Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader's]] [[Aide/Legends|aide]] aboard the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer/Legends|Imperial Star Destroyer]] ''[[Devastator/Legends|Devastator]]''. In [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]], after the Rebels acquired the [[Death Star plans/Legends|plans]] of the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] [[Superweapon/Legends|superweapon]], the ''Devastator'' chased the [[Alderaanian/Legends|Alderaanian]] [[CR90 corvette/Legends|CR90 corvette]] ''[[Tantive IV/Legends|Tantive IV]]'', Imperial [[Senator/Legends|Senator]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa's]] [[Consular ship/Legends|consular ship]], to the planet [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]]. When the [[Starship/Legends|starship]] was [[battle of Tatooine (Galactic Civil War)|captured and boarded]] over the planet, the [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtroopers]] quickly secured the ship, and Praji hastened to the main [[Computer/Legends|computer]] room to search for the stolen plans.

However, the plans were copied into the [[Memory core|memory banks]] of the [[Astromech droid/Legends|astromech droid]] [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]] who, accompanied by his [[Counterpart/Legends|counterpart]], the [[Protocol droid/Legends|protocol droid]] [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]], left the [[Corvette/Legends|corvette]] in an [[Escape pod/Legends|escape pod]] which crash landed on Tatooine. Praji reported to Vader that an escape pod had been jettisoned from the ship during the battle, but that no lifeforms had been detected aboard the pod. Vader ordered Praji to personally search for the plans on the surface of Tatooine, but he took the orders lightly and delegated the mission to his subordinates. He ordered [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Kosh/Legends|Kosh's]] local [[Garrison/Legends|garrison]], Captain [[Mod Terrik|Terrik's]] [[Desert Sands]], and Vader's [[501st Legion/Legends|501st Legion]] to search for the escape pod. The [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceports]] on the planet were quarantined, but with the help of [[Corellian/Legends|Corellian]] [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]] [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], [[Moisture farmer/Legends|moisture farmer]] [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]] and [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]], the two [[Droid/Legends|droids]] evaded the [[Blockade/Legends|blockades]] and escaped into [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]] aboard Solo's [[Millennium Falcon/Legends|freighter]], heading to [[Alderaan/Legends|Alderaan]], the [[Homeworld/Legends|homeworld]] of Senator Organa. After the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]] [[4 ABY/Legends|four years later]], Praji joined the forces of several Imperial [[Warlord/Legends|warlords]], and eventually served under the [[Cloning/Legends|resurrected]] [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Galactic Emperor]], His [[Transfer essence|Immortal]] Majesty [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]]. With his actions in the [[Battle of Kaikielius (Galactic Civil War)|battle]] of [[Kaikielius]], Praji earned the [[Governor/Legends|governorship]] of the planet.

==Biography==
===Early years===
{{Quote|Self-respect is the first casualty of politics, the final casualty of business, and the first benefit of a military career&mdash;your choice should be obvious.|A recruiter's pragmatic advice to Praji|Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Praji}}
The [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Sexes/Legends|male]] Nahdonnis Praji was born to the wealthy and influential [[House Praji]] of the [[Capital/Legends|capital]] [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Coruscant/Legends|Coruscant]]<ref name="tinker" /> after the first quarter of the [[Standard year/Legends|year]] [[37 BBY]].<ref name="birth" /> His [[Parent/Legends|father]] was [[Griff Praji]], a brother of [[Tannon Praji]], the [[First Minister (Coruscant Ministry of Ingress)|First Minister]] of the [[Coruscant Ministry of Ingress/Legends|Coruscant Ministry of Ingress]]. Nahdonnis Praji was interested in military history throughout his childhood. He often studied [[HoloNet News/Legends|HoloNet News]] reports on the tactics of [[Jedi General/Legends|Jedi Generals]] and [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] [[ace/Legends|aces]] during the [[Clone Wars/Legends|Clone Wars]]. Prior to the dissolution of the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] in [[19 BBY/Legends|19 BBY]], the Prajii were traditionally idle rich or career bureaucrats, but some of the [[Coruscanti/Legends|Coruscanti]] Prajii entered military service: [[Collin Praji]] became a [[Colonel/Legends|Colonel]] in the [[Grand Army of the Republic/Legends|Grand Army of the Republic]], while [[Praji (Moff)|another Praji]] became the commanding [[Moff/Legends|Moff]] of the [[Fourth Outer Rim Army]].<ref name="tinker" /><ref name="Warfare">''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]''</ref> [[Standard month/Legends|Months]] after the [[Mission to Mustafar/Legends|war's end]], Praji came to the age of eighteen and enlisted to the newly established [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire's]] [[Imperial Navy/Legends|navy]].<ref name="tinker" /> He gained his basic training and graduated with honors from the [[Academy of Carida|Academy]] on [[Carida/Legends|Carida]].<ref name="CCG" /> The Praji family donated [[Prime clone|genetic templates]] for Imperial [[Stormtrooper/Legends|stormtrooper]] [[Cloning/Legends|development programs]].<ref name="vg5">{{SWArchive|url=episode-iv/explore/visualguides/chp05.html|text=Visual Guide&mdash;Chapter 5: Vader Confronts the Princess}}</ref> Nahdonnis Praji himself had a child, a daughter named [[Tyla Praji|Tyla]].<ref name="tinker" />

[[File:Vengeance-Datar.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Praji arrived aboard the ''Vengeance'' to destroy a Rebel cell on Nar Shaddaa.]]
Praji participated in the [[Battle of Almak|subjugation]] of the [[Homeworld/Legends|native]] [[Leffingite/Legends|Leffingites]] on the planet [[Almak/Legends|Almak]], and he had to admit that the Empire's [[All Terrain]] [[Walker/Legends|walkers]], which he viewed as graceless brutes, were indeed effective. In [[1 BBY/Legends|1 BBY]], early in the [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|Galactic Civil War]], Praji was assigned to the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Vengeance (Imperial-class, Jerec)|Vengeance]]'' and was dispatched to look for [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Rebel]] supply networks. Later, he served under [[Vice Admiral/Legends|Vice Admiral]] [[Slenn]], who ordered his [[Troop/Legends|troops]] into an [[Attack at Datar|unwinnable scenario]] against the Rebels on the planet [[Datar]]. After the botched attack, the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]] [[Death/Legends|killed]] Slenn and took command of the operation.<ref name="tinker" />

Vader's next target was the Rebel base on [[Nar Shaddaa/Legends|Nar Shaddaa]], the [[Moon/Legends|moon]] of the [[Hutt/Legends|Hutt]] planet [[Nal Hutta/Legends|Nal Hutta]]. Praji [[Battle of Nar Shaddaa (Galactic Civil War)|led the troops]] personally to the [[Level 88|88th Level]] of the moon's [[Corellian Sector (Nar Shaddaa)|Corellian Sector]], and reached a very high collateral kill count. He used a flanking tactic once favored by [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]] [[General/Legends|General]] Anakin Skywalker, who had utilized it during the Clone Wars. Praji's action and previous records impressed Vader, who assigned him into a staff position with greater responsibility.<ref name="tinker" /> He became Vader's [[Aide/Legends|aide]] on board the [[Imperial I-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial I''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Devastator/Legends|Devastator]]'',<ref name="CCG" /> but lost his permanent command post, for most of the ''Devastator''{{'s}} troop complement was filled with the elite stormtroopers of the [[501st Legion/Legends|501st Legion]], under the command of [[Commander/Legends|Commander]] [[Daine Jir]].<ref name="tinker" />

===Blockade of Toprawa===
{{Quote|Tantive IV, this is the ''Devastator''. Our sensors indicate you have intercepted illegal transmissions in this solar system. Heave to or we'll open fire!|Commander Praji, to Captain Antilles|Star Wars (radio)}}
In [[0 BBY/Legends|0 BBY]],<ref name="NEC">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> on the planet [[Toprawa/Legends|Toprawa]], the Rebel Alliance obtained the [[Death Star plans/Legends|plans]] of the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|first Death Star]], a new Imperial [[Superweapon/Legends|superweapon]]. The [[Toprawa system]] was declared restricted,<ref name="radio">[[Star Wars (radio)|''Star Wars'' radio drama]] and ''[[Star Wars: The National Public Radio Dramatization]]'', p. 70&ndash;78</ref> and [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Vader, who realized the plans were now in the hands of the Rebellion, took the ''Devastator'' to the world.<ref name="rise">''[[The Rise and Fall of Darth Vader]]'', ch. 14</ref> The Rebels planned to [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggle]] out the plans from the planet aboard the [[Alderaanian/Legends|Alderaanian]] [[Consular ship/Legends|consular ship]] ''[[Tantive IV/Legends|Tantive IV]]''. As the [[Starship/Legends|vessel]] leapt into the Toprawa [[Star system/Legends|system]], it began receiving a transmission from the surface of the planet.<ref name="radio" /> Commander Praji stood beside Vader on the [[Bridge (starship)/Legends|bridge]] of the ''Devastator'' when the [[Sensor/Legends|sensors]] detected the consular ship. As the data was transmitting, an Imperial [[communications officer]] detected the signal, and Praji contacted the ''Tantive IV'', ordering it to heave to and prepare to be searched.<ref name="rise" /> Scrambling for more [[Time/Legends|time]],<ref name="radio" /> the Rebel [[Captain/Legends|Captain]] [[Raymus Antilles/Legends|Raymus Antilles]] told the ''Devastator'' of their "malfunction" and attempted to use the vessel's [[Diplomat/Legends|diplomatic]] immunity. Praji acknowledged the message and ordered the ''Tantive IV'' to hold its course and prepare for boarding.<ref name="rise" />

Seconds later the transmission ended, and Antilles replied to the ''Devastator'', insisting that as they were on a diplomatic mission they could not be detained. He also ordered his crew to accelerate the ship to full speed and get into [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]].<ref name="radio" /> Praji announced that they had detected the transmission of the plans, and again ordered the ''Tantive IV'' to heave to or prepare to be fired on. Vader ordered the [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] to shoot for minimum damage, and only moments after it began firing, the ''Tantive IV'' finally jumped to [[Lightspeed/Legends|lightspeed]]. It was impossible to track a ship through hyperspace; however, the ''Tantive IV'' carried an Imperial [[Homing beacon/Legends|homing device]], which had been installed on a [[Subjugation of Ralltiir|previous trip]] to the planet [[Ralltiir/Legends|Ralltiir]]. Praji consulted a sensor screen and reported that the ''Tantive IV'' was heading to the planet [[Tatooine/Legends|Tatooine]].<ref name="rise" />

===Battle above Tatooine===

The ''Devastator'' followed and [[battle of Tatooine (Galactic Civil War)|captured]] the Rebel vessel in the [[Tatoo system/Legends|Tatoo system]],<ref name="rise" /> where the [[Trooper/Legends|troopers]] of the 501st legion besieged the crippled consular ship.<ref name="BF2">''[[Star Wars: Battlefront II]]''</ref> After the first wave of troops, under the command of an [[unidentified stormtrooper commander (Tantive IV)|assault leader]], broke the defenses of the Rebel vessel, Lord Vader, accompanied by Praji and Commander Jir, boarded the ship.<ref name="manga">''[[Star Wars Manga: A New Hope 1]]''</ref> Praji led a cluster of troops to the ship's main [[Computer/Legends|computer]] room to search for the stolen plans.<ref name="ANH novel">[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (novel)|''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope'' novelization]], ch. 2</ref> He was tasked to check the computers for the plans and any other useful information.<ref name="cri1">{{FFCite|69|CRI1-4, ''Crisis on the'' Tantive IV}}</ref>

Praji used the modified [[R4-series agromech droid]], [[R4-M9/Legends|R4-M9]], to pull all data from the [[Memory core|memory banks]] before the Rebels could destroy it,<ref name="cri1" /> but he did not find any valuable information or evidence of bank erasure.<ref name="ANH novel" /> When Vader and Commander Jir arrived at the main computer room,<ref name="cross">''[[Star Wars: Complete Cross-Sections]]'', p. 104</ref> Praji delivered an update of the search to the Dark Lord<ref name="anakin">''[[Anakin Skywalker: The Story of Darth Vader]]'', p. 30</ref> by reporting that the plans were not aboard the ship and that no transmissions had been made. He added that an [[Escape pod/Legends|escape pod]] had left the ship, but that no life forms had been detected aboard it. Vader ordered him to personally lead a detachment of stormtroopers to Tatooine and search for the escape pod used by [[Protocol droid/Legends|protocol droid]] [[C-3PO/Legends|C-3PO]] and [[Astromech droid/Legends|astromech droid]] [[R2-D2/Legends|R2-D2]], the latter of whom carried the stolen plans.<ref name="ANH" /> Vader also ordered Praji to send detachments to every [[Spaceport/Legends|spaceport]] and quarantine the planet.<ref name="rise" />

===Search for the droids===
{{Quote|She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them&hellip; See to it personally Commander.|Darth Vader, to Commanders Jir and Praji|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}
[[File:Stormtrooper Search.png|thumb|left|250px|Praji ordered the local garrison, the Desert Sands and the 501st Legion to search for the escape pod.]]
By Vader's order, Commander Praji supervised the search for the [[Death Star/Legends|Death Star's]] missing plans on Tatooine.<ref name="cswe">{{CSWECite|III|41|Praji, Nahdonnis}}</ref> His first order was to assign Captain [[Kosh/Legends|Kosh's]] local [[Garrison/Legends|garrison]] to the task, while the 501st was readied.<ref name="tinker" /> The [[Desert Sands]] [[Desert stormtrooper|sandtrooper]] detachment,<ref name="hun1">{{FFCite|10|HUN1-4, ''The Hunt for the Droids''}}</ref> which arrived to relieve the troopers garrisoned in the [[City/Legends|city]] of [[Mos Eisley/Legends|Mos Eisley]],<ref name="desert wind">''[[When the Desert Wind Turns: The Stormtrooper's Tale]]''</ref> were also ordered by Praji to begin searching for the escape pod immediately.<ref name="hun1" /> After a brief landfall, Praji delegated the overall command of the situation to Captain Kosh.<ref name="tinker" />

After a few days' searching, Captain [[Mod Terrik]] of the Desert Sands reported to Praji that a young [[Moisture farmer/Legends|moisture farmer]], possibly a Rebel sympathizer if not a Rebel agent, had taken the [[Droid/Legends|droids]] and was presumably heading to the nearest spaceport, Mos Eisley. In reality, the actions of the Desert Sands&mdash;murdering his uncle [[Owen Lars/Legends|Owen Lars]] and aunt [[Beru Whitesun Lars/Legends|Beru Whitesun Lars]]&mdash;had caused the [[Farm/Legends|farmer]], [[Luke Skywalker/Legends|Luke Skywalker]], to accompany [[Jedi Master/Legends|Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi/Legends|Obi-Wan Kenobi]] in his quest of returning the stolen plans to the Rebellion. Praji concurred with Terrik and ordered him to quarantine Mos Eisley.<ref name="hun5">{{FFCite|16|HUN5-8, ''The Hunt for the Droids''}}</ref>

However, the delay in coordinating the units of Kosh's troops, Terrik's troops and the 501st enabled the droids to bypass the [[Blockade/Legends|blockade]]<ref name="tinker" /> and escape from Tatooine aboard the [[Light freighter/Legends|light freighter]] ''[[Millennium Falcon/Legends|Millennium Falcon]]''. A stormtrooper officer saw the [[Freighter/Legends|freighter]] lift into the sky and reported to Commander Praji, who alerted the [[Orbit/Legends|orbiting]] Star Destroyers. [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], the ''Falcon''{{'s}} captain, slipped past the blockade, leaving the Commander in the uncomfortable situation of reporting his failure to Vader. Praji also reported the description of the fugitives and their escape vessel to all Imperial outposts.<ref name="hun5" /> He personally reported the bad news to Vader, who spared his life.<ref name="tinker" />

===Later career===
{{Quote|Delusions of grandeur, hah!'' [&hellip;] ''But now the physical incarnation of the phrase was staring me in the face, and I don't mind telling you I didn't care for it at all.|Praji, to Voren Na'al about Emperor Palpatine|Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Praji}}
[[File:VorenHeadshot.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Historian Voren Na'al interviewed the retired Governor-General Praji.]]
After the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]], which saw the Rebels destroy the Death Star based on information they had found in the stolen plans, Vader formed [[Death Squadron/Legends|Death Squadron]],<ref name="ANH" /> a squadron of Star Destroyers that included the ''Devastator''. Vader brought his staff to his new [[Flagship/Legends|flagship]], the [[Executor/Legends|first ship]] of the [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought/Legends|''Executor''-class Star Dreadnought]] line, but General [[Maximilian Veers]] blocked Praji from the appointment, and Vader did not overrule him.<ref name="tinker" />

In [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]] during the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], [[Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] was killed, which led to the splintering of Empire into various [[Imperial Civil War|warring]] factions. Praji served under several different Imperial [[Warlord/Legends|warlords]] and ascended to the rank of General. He chose his allies by searching for the best way to carry on the [[New Order/Legends|New Order's]] mission. When the [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Galactic Emperor]], His [[Transfer essence|Immortal]] Majesty Palpatine returned from the [[Deep Core/Legends|Deep Core]] of [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]], Praji joined his forces and met him personally for the first and only time.<ref name="tinker" />

In [[10 ABY/Legends|10 ABY]], Praji led the portion of the [[Shadow Hand Fleet]] that [[Battle of Kaikielius (Galactic Civil War)|conquered]] the planet [[Kaikielius]] prior to the [[Second Battle of Coruscant|push]] towards Coruscant at the onset of [[Operation Shadow Hand]]. Praji enjoyed destroying the [[Skyhook/Legends|skyhooks]] of the [[House Vahali]], an old rival of his family, and placed the planet under martial law. His higher position led him to realize that the Emperor's theocracy was not the Empire he had joined decades earlier, so he requested Kaikielius as a fief in order to leave the military. Emperor Palpatine then made him the [[Governor/Legends|Governor-General]] of the world, re-establishing the old connection between Kaikielius and House Praji.<ref name="tinker" /> After the [[Battle of Coruscant (Yuuzhan Vong War)|Battle of Coruscant]] during the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]], the Coruscanti Praji regrouped on Kaikielius. Praji later retired from governorship and met [[Historian/Legends|historian]] [[Voren Na'al/Legends|Voren Na'al]], who asked him about his encounter with Emperor Palpatine in an interview.<ref name="tinker" />

His daughter [[Tyla Praji|Tyla]] would go on to become a prominent member of the [[Galactic Alliance Guard]] during the [[Second Galactic Civil War]].<ref name="tinker" />

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Surrender in the name of the Emperor! We have you under our guns!|Praji, to the ''Tantive IV''|Star Wars (radio)}}
Praji was all business when dealing with his superiors, and he often delegated assignments to a subordinate, such as Captain Kosh. His subordinates knew him for intolerance and level-headed professionalism, although Praji was not a man quick to anger. His businesslike professionalism impressed Lord Vader, too.<ref name="finest">{{InsiderCite|96|The Empire's Finest: Who's Who in the Imperial Military}}, p. 40</ref> As a member of the capital's aristocracy, Praji disrespected the [[Rimmer]]s, people hailing from the [[Outer Rim Territories/Legends|Outer Rim]] region of the galaxy, even his superiors. He was an old-fashioned military man who disdained foot-soldiers partly due to [[Officers' Candidacy Training|Imperial officer training]], which disregarded the clones, who were "made to be killed." He became so committed to the orderly despotism of the Galactic Empire, that during the Imperial Civil War, he served under several warlords looking for the best way to carry on the New Order's mission.<ref name="tinker" /> Praji chose to wear the prominent sideburns that were popular among the [[Imperial officer/Legends|Imperial officers]] around the time of the Battle of Yavin.<ref name="tjas">''[[The Jedi Academy Sourcebook]]'', p. 61</ref> Praji graduated with honors from the Imperial naval academy and became a good [[Pilot/Legends|pilot]] and [[Navigator/Legends|navigator]].<ref name="CCG" /> Under able officers like him, stormtroopers learned to adapt to their environment.<ref name="VG">''[[Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary]]'', p. 234</ref>

During the search for the Death Star plans, Praji recited to Vader mechanically that the plans of the Death Star were not aboard the ''Tantive IV'',<ref name="ANH novel" /> but hurriedly added that the supposedly empty escape pod had been released during the fight.<ref name="DS">''[[Death Star (novel)|Death Star]]'', ch. 52</ref> He waited attentively for the orders of the Sith Lord,<ref name="ANH novel" /> who deemed him highly loyal and too capable to waste and spared the Commander's life when Praji disobeyed his direct order by not searching personally for the missing plans. Praji never put much stock in his family's old vendetta against House Vahali, but it was tremendous personal pleasure for him to break their power by knocking their skyhook headquarters during the Imperial Civil War.<ref name="tinker" />

He also held a lot of loyalty to the Emperor up until Operation Shadow Hand, when he learned about the Emperor's plans of creating a theocracy of Dark Side Mages. Although he had heard throughout his career that the Emperor possessed delusions of grandeur, he dismissed the statements due to believing that they were simply figures of speeches and pejorative from lesser individuals who couldn't comprehend truly great men. However, upon learning of the Emperor's plans for a theocracy, and being in direct conflict with the New Order he had served, he was forced to reassess his earlier beliefs on the Emperor possessing such.<ref name="tinker" />

In May 2007, during [[Celebration IV]], Roubicek took part in a round-table discussion chaired by Scott Chernoff, in which he reminisced about his role as Praji.

Praji appears in various adaptations of ''A New Hope'', but his line and look differ sometimes. In the 1976 novelization, he speaks a different line and appears as the ''"officer in charge"'' of ''"a cluster of tired-looking troops."'' In the [[1978]] ''[[Contemporary Motivators: Star Wars]]'' comic book, he is depicted as a stormtrooper and his line is slightly different than in the film.<ref name="CM">''[[Contemporary Motivators: Star Wars]]'', p. 7</ref> In 1978's ''[[The Story of Star Wars]]'', he is identified as an Imperial trooper.<ref name="storybook">''[[The Star Wars Storybook]]''</ref>

In the [[1981]] [[Star Wars (radio)|''Star Wars'' radio drama's]] script, as presented in the ''[[Star Wars: The National Public Radio Dramatization]]'', Praji is addressed as 'Trooper'. However, there is also an unidentified Imperial commander<ref name="radio" /> who the 2007 young reader novel ''[[The Rise and Fall of Darth Vader]]'' identifies to be Commander Praji.<ref name="rise" /> In the 1987 ''[[Star Wars Droids 6: Star Wars According to the Droids, Book I]]'' comic, he speaks a slightly different line and is wearing a gray uniform.<ref name="droids6">''[[Star Wars Droids 6: Star Wars According to the Droids, Book I]]'', p. 5</ref>

In the [[1997]] young reader book ''[[Darth Vader's Mission: The Search for the Secret Plans]]'', Praji is blond and he is wearing a gray uniform.<ref name="DVM">''[[Darth Vader's Mission: The Search for the Secret Plans]]''</ref> In the [[1998]] reference book ''[[Anakin Skywalker: The Story of Darth Vader]]'', the captain of the ''Devastator'' calls the ''Tantive IV'' above Toprawa,<ref name="anakin" /> but ''The Rise and Fall of Darth Vader'' attributes the lines to Praji.<ref name="rise" />
