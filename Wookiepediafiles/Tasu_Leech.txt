{{Quote|Tasu Leech. Good to see you."<br />&laquo;Wrong again, Solo. It’s over for you, and for your associate.&raquo;|Solo is surprised by the entrance of Leech and the Kanjiklub|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}
'''Tasu Leech''' was the leader of [[Kanjiklub]], a criminal organization active approximately thirty [[Standard year|years]] after the [[Battle of Endor]].<ref name="Tasu Leech" />

Leech refused to speak a word of [[Galactic Basic]], considering it a "soft language for soft people." Tasu Leech had defeated many would-be usurpers to his command, as the Kanjiklub tradition went that the leader may be challenged to combat by his underlings, for control of the position. He wielded a [["Huttsplitter" blaster rifle]], custom made by his lieutenant, [[Razoo Qin-Fee]]. The Huttsplitter earned its name due to the history of the Kanjiklub's home planet, [[Nar Kanji]], that used to be subjugated by the [[Hutt]]s. The human colonists later overthrew the [[Hutt Clan|Hutt Cartel]], and struck out on their own. Tasu Leech wore lightweight armor, and a plastoid blast jerkin.
