{{Quote|We all do our part for the Empire.|Mas Amedda|Tarkin (novel)}}
'''Mas Amedda''' was a [[Chagrian]] [[Sexes|male]] [[Politics|politician]] who served in high-ranking government roles during the twilight [[Standard year|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic]] and helped establish and administrate its successor state, the [[Galactic Empire]]. A native of [[Champala]], Amedda was a talented political actor who filled the role of [[Vice Chair]] of the [[Galactic Senate]] of the Republic under two [[Supreme Chancellor]]s on the capital [[Planet|world]] of [[Coruscant]]. His first chancellor, [[Finis Valorum]], was ousted from the [[Office of the Chancellor|office]] following a [[Vote of No Confidence]] in his leadership during the [[Trade Federation]]'s [[Invasion of Naboo|invasion]] of the [[Mid Rim]] planet [[Naboo]]. Amedda weathered the change in administration and retained his post under Valorum's successor, Naboo's [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]]. He became a close associate of Palpatine's during his two terms in office and eventually became aware of the chancellor's alter ego as Darth Sidious, a [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] intent on reforming the Republic into an autocratic state.

Near the end of Palpatine's second term, thousands of discontented [[star system]]s declared their intention to secede from the Republic, sparking the [[Separatist Crisis]] and creating a political atmosphere that kept the Supreme Chancellor in power. Amedda was instrumental in helping concentrate authority in the Office of the Chancellor at this time&mdash;efforts that culminated with the creation of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] as tensions between the secessionist [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] and Republic devolved into the [[The galaxy|galaxy-spanning]] [[Clone Wars]]. During the war, Amedda conspired with the [[Sith Lord]] to continue the unprecedented militarization of the Republic and marginalize the Senate's role as a body of oversight and consent. Amedda managed the early stages of the secret [[Project Stardust|mobile battle station project]], which would ultimately produce the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]] [[superweapon]], whilst at the same time frequently opposing efforts by [[senator]]s to push for peace with the Confederacy.

At the end of the war in [[19 BBY]], Amedda stood with Palpatine as the chancellor used his authority to declare the [[Jedi Order]] enemies of the state and transform the Republic into the First Galactic Empire. As the Senate became an increasingly irrelevant body, the Chagrian transitioned to a new role as [[Grand Vizier]] of the Empire. In this station he oversaw a rapidly expanding military and civilian bureaucracy and served as the administrative right hand to the newly anointed and increasingly reclusive [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] Palpatine. The Empire's oppressive and abusive reign was eventually opposed by the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] during the [[Galactic Civil War]]&mdash;a rebellion that achieved its greatest victory in [[4 ABY]], when the Emperor and many other Imperial leaders were killed at the [[Battle of Endor]].

In the aftermath, Amedda was the highest ranking political leader in the Empire. With no control over the [[Imperial Military]], the Grand Vizier was helpless as the [[New Order]] fractured and the recently established [[New Republic]] seized large parts of the galaxy. Amedda attempted to hold the regime together from Coruscant, but as the throneworld was roiled by [[Coruscant civil war|civil war]], military leaders like [[Counselor to the Empire|Counselor]] [[Gallius Rax]] and [[Grand Admiral]] [[Rae Sloane]] effectively took control, leaving the Grand Vizier stranded. After attempts at surrender and [[suicide]] Amedda was confined to the [[Imperial Palace]] by order of Counselor Rax until [[5 ABY]], when he escaped Coruscant and formally surrendered the Empire by signing the [[Galactic Concordance]], thereby ending the Galactic Civil War. As part of the agreement, he was afforded continual rule on Coruscant as the leader of a [[Coruscant provisional government|provisional government]], but under the surveillance of Republic overseers both Amedda and his administration were rendered powerless.

==Biography==
===Senate stalwart===
{{Quote|Enter the bureaucrat&mdash;the true rulers of the Republic. And on the payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add.|Senator Palpatine, on Amedda's role in the Valorum administration|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace}}
Mas Amedda was a native of the [[Chagrian]] [[homeworld]] of [[Champala]]<ref name="SWJB" /> in the [[Inner Rim]],<ref name="Beginner Game">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens Beginner Game]]''</ref> living during the latter [[Standard decade|decades]] of the [[Galactic Republic]]'s reign as the preeminent [[Politics|political]] body in [[the galaxy]].<ref name="TPM" /> Amedda was an eager and capable politician during this time and achieved the office of [[Senator]] in the Republic's [[Galactic Senate]] on [[Coruscant]]<ref name="Catalyst" /> prior to [[32 BBY]]. During his time as [[Chair of the Senate/Legends|Chair of the Senate]], he served as a committee chairman and worked alongside representatives from the [[Water|icy]] [[Planet|world]] of [[Vallt]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories]], who Amedda noted were growing increasingly discontent with their lack of trade support and respect from the Republic.<ref name="Catalyst" />

The Chagrian politician was eventually selected to serve as [[Vice Chair]] of the Senate at large&mdash;a role that placed him second only to the [[Supreme Chancellor]] in the Republic's political hierarchy<ref name="Catalyst" /> and installed him as Speaker of the Senate.<ref name="DB" /> In this capacity Amedda had a hand in managing the Republic's overwhelming bureaucratic superstructure and advised Chancellor [[Finis Valorum]] on matters of Senate procedure.<ref name="Encyclopedia">{{SWE|characterS|masamedda|Mas Amedda}}</ref> Criticisms about the unresponsiveness of the Republic and pervasive corruption in congress plagued the Valorum administration in this era,<ref name="Valorum">{{Databank|supreme-chancellor-valorum|Supreme Chancellor Valorum}}</ref> and Amedda became embroiled in widespread rumors that he was on the payroll of the [[Trade Federation]].<ref name="Encyclopedia" /> The [[Neimoidian]]-run megacorporation had become a significant economic and political force in the Republic over its years of operation and enjoyed both unprecedented representation within the Senate as well as near-complete control of shipping and commerce in the Outer Rim Territories. Much to the chagrin of the Federation, the Senate passed [[Prop 31-814D]] in 32 BBY, which authorized the Republic to levy taxes on trade in the [[Free Trade Zone]]s which had previously been dominated by the Neimoidian's tariffs with little government regulation.<ref name="Propaganda">''[[Star Wars Propaganda: A History of Persuasive Art in the Galaxy]]''</ref>

[[File:ZodKneelsBeforeAmidala-TPMHD.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Amedda calls for order as the Senate demands a recall of Chancellor Valorum.]]
In protest, the Trade Federation established an illegal [[blockade]]<ref name="TPM" /> around the [[Mid Rim]]<ref name="Ultimate">''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''</ref> world of [[Naboo]], cutting off all shipping to the planet. The egregious overstep threw the Senate into crisis, spurring endless debate and further damaging the Valorum administration's political viability.<ref name="TPM" /> Amedda was notably unhelpful to the Supreme Chancellor at this time and leveraged his bureaucratic power to slow efforts to provide relief to Naboo.<ref name="Encyclopedia" /> The Federation ultimately [[Invasion of Naboo|invaded]] the world and tried to force its [[Monarchy|monarch]], [[Queen]] [[Padm√© Amidala]], to legalize the action by signing a treaty with the conglomerate. Instead, she fled with the aid of [[Jedi]] negotiators to seek Republic intervention in an appearance before the Senate.<ref name="TPM" />

As Vice Chair, Amedda presided over the [[Special session of Congress|special session of congress]] in the [[Senate Building]]'s [[Galactic Senate Chamber|convocation chamber]] alongside Supreme Chancellor Valorum and his administrative [[aide]], [[Sei Taria]]. Queen Amidala's appearance before the Senate had been arranged by Naboo's Senator [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]]<ref name="TPM" />&mdash;a rising star with whom Amedda worked to sabotage Valorum's credibility.<ref name="CharEncyclopedia">''[[Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded]]''</ref> Together, Palpatine and Amidala presented an impassioned plea for relief from the Trade Federation's predations, but were interrupted and accused of slander by the Federation's representative, [[Lott Dod]]. Dod called for a commission to be formed to verify the [[Naboo (people)|Naboo's]] claims and was seconded by [[Aks Moe]] of the [[Congress of Malastare]]. In spite of his desire to provide relief, Valorum reluctantly deferred to Amedda's procedural advice and sustained the objection, asking that Amidala defer her motion to allow for a commission to be established. On Palpatine's advice, Amidala declined and responded to the chancellor's apparent indecisiveness by calling for a [[Vote of No Confidence]] in Valorum's leadership&mdash;a motion that proved overwhelmingly popular when the chamber broke out into calls to vote immediately, drowning out Amedda's calls for order.<ref name="TPM" />

The motion from the Naboo delegation was successful and Valorum was removed from office. While an election for a new Supreme Chancellor pitted Palpatine against [[Ainlee Teem]] of [[Malastare]] and [[Bail Antilles]] of [[Alderaan]],<ref name="TPM" /> Amedda served as steward of the Senate.<ref name="Encyclopedia" /> Palpatine rode a wave of public sympathy for Naboo's plight into an electoral victory<ref name="TPM" /> and kept Amedda as Vice Chair of the Senate, making him an integral part of the new Supreme Chancellor's administration. Palpatine eventually confided in Amedda that his political persona was merely an alter ego&mdash;in truth, he was Darth Sidious,<ref name="DB" /> a [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] and longtime enemy of the [[Jedi Order]]. Although the Jedi had long been the protectors of the Republic,<ref name="TPM" /> Amedda shared the [[Sith]]'s vision for a strong central government and so became an active participant in Sidious's grand scheme to supplant the ancient democracy with a [[New Order]].<ref name="DB" />

===Transforming the Republic===
====Secessionist Movement====
{{Quote|This is a crisis. The Senate must vote to give the chancellor emergency powers.|Mas Amedda to the Loyalist Committee|Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones}}
In the years following Valorum's ouster, Palpatine's administration enjoyed popular approval even as discontent grew in the outlying systems.<ref name="Propaganda" /> During this time, Amedda worked with the Supreme Chancellor and his senior aide, the [[Umbaran]] [[Sly Moore]] to attend to matters of state and gradually concentrate power within the [[Office of the Chancellor]]. As talk of secession grew and the Senate and bureaucracy became increasingly ineffective, the administration publicly appeared to be earnestly struggling to hold the Republic together.<ref name="Propaganda" /> In truth, Palpatine was stoking the potential for war through the ex-Jedi firebrand [[Count]] [[Dooku]], who had become a much-admired proponent of separatism on disaffected worlds.<ref name="AotC">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]</ref> Amedda continued to play the role of loyal Vice Chair of the Senate and worked with the [[Loyalist Committee]] to advise the chancellor on how to manage the growing rift in the Republic.<ref name="Propaganda" />

[[File:Strength and Unity.jpg|thumb|right|210px|The Loyalist Committee's ''Strength and Unity'' poster was a major gaffe for Amedda.]]
Near the end of Palpatine's second term, a slew of worlds seceded from the Republic and formed the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]], throwing Coruscant into a panic. The Senate suspended the mandated term limits in response to the growing [[Separatist Crisis]], allowing the Supreme Chancellor and his administration to remain in power for a full decade. Around this time, Amedda and the Loyalist Committee focused on rousing Republic patriotism through concerted messaging campaigns that included commissioned works of [[propaganda]]. One well-recognized piece, ''[[Strength and Unity]]'' was conceived by Amedda himself and intended to highlight Rim and [[Expansion Region]] peoples within the Republic. The poster was arranged by [[artist]] [[Angilar Bosh]] and included an image of the Vice Chair to represent the Chagrian people. The self-inclusion was widely criticized in the media and the campaign was marred by accusations of narcissism on Amedda's behalf.<ref name="Propaganda" />

The growing crisis was compounded when the Republic's economy faltered under heavy debt and the Confederacy began military mobilization. Predictions of open war became common and the Republic, which had survived for centuries without a central military, was faced with the decision to create one under the [[Military Creation Act]].<ref name="Propaganda" /> Although the administration was publicly dedicated to a peaceful solution to the Separatist Crisis, Amedda and Palpatine worked to promote militarization through political manipulation. In [[22 BBY]], the Senate was intended to vote on the resolution but the decision was delayed after an [[Plot to assassinate Padm√© Amidala|attempted assassination]] of Padm√© Amidala, now Senator of Naboo. Amedda escorted Amidala and the rest of the Loyalist Committee to a meeting with the Supreme Chancellor in the immediate aftermath, wherein Palpatine suggested that the senator be put under the protection of the [[Jedi High Council]]. The tactic removed Amidala, the leading anti-militarist voice in the Senate, from the [[capital]] in advance of the vote, allowing Amedda to circumvent her in his manipulations.<ref name="AotC" />

In the following days, it was [[Mission to Kamino (Separatist Crisis)|discovered]] that a [[Cloning|clone]] [[army]] had been created for the Republic in secret on the hidden world of [[Kamino]]. Shortly afterwards, Amedda attended a meeting in the [[Emperor's office|Chancellor's office]] with the Loyalist Committee and Jedi Council wherein [[Jedi Knight]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] reported that the Confederacy had forged a pact with several galactic megacorporations to manufacture an [[Separatist Droid Army|army]] of [[battle droid]]s to wage war against the Republic. The revelations shook the Jedi and Senate, but allowed Amedda to insist that Palpatine be granted emergency powers to handle the crisis. In an attempt to manipulate the Naboo [[Junior Representative]] [[Jar Jar Binks]] into proposing an emergency powers amendment, Amedda suggested that Senator Amidala would have made the proposal were she available. The tactic was successful, and Binks called for the Supreme Chancellor to be granted [[Empergency Powers Act|immediate emergency authority]] in lieu of a vote on the Military Creation Act.<ref name="AotC" />

The Senate approved the measure in a special session presided over by Palpatine, Amedda, and Moore. The Supreme Chancellor accepted the authorities attached to the wartime powers and activated the clones of Kamino to form the [[Grand Army of the Republic]], which would operate at the behest of the Senate and fight under the command of [[Jedi General]]s. This development was followed shortly by a [[Battle of Geonosis|massive battle]] on the Separatist foundry world of [[Geonosis]] between the Republic and Confederacy&mdash;the first conflict of the [[Clone Wars]]. In the wake of the battle, Amedda joined the chancellor and members of the Loyalist Committee to observe the Grand Army deploy to the war front from its Coruscant staging grounds.<ref name="AotC" />

====The Clone Wars====
=====Palpatine's projects=====
{{Quote|How long will it take to develop this&hellip;marvel of technology? I need an estimate.''"<br />"''Very difficult to say. Many of the greatest minds in the Republic are working on it. Nevertheless, the weapon will require something truly novel in the realm of energy enhancement. A breakthrough of, dare I say, galactic proportions.|Mas Amedda and Doctor Gubacher discuss the development of the Death Star|Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel}}
[[File:Parade.png|thumb|left|300px|Amedda joined Palpatine and the Loyalist Committee to oversee the launch of the Grand Army of the Republic.]]
At the outset of the Clone Wars, Chancellor Palpatine directed Mas Amedda to establish and direct the [[Strategic Advisory Cell]]&mdash;a wartime strategy council tasked with the most classified [[Republic military]] projects. Within the first year of the war, the cell consisted of 150 members, including the Vice Chair, his advisers, representatives of Republic-allied industrial firms, as well as members of the [[Republic Special Weapons Group|Special Weapons Group]], the [[War Production Board]], the Army, [[Republic Navy|Navy]], and the [[Commission for the Protection of the Republic]]. All members of the group were subject to the [[Official Secrets Oath]] which protected their work from the Jedi and much of the Senate. One of Amedda's early recruits to the Strategic Advisory Cell was [[Orson Callan Krennic]], a [[Lieutenant Commander]] with the [[Republic Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]] who had directed the redesign of the [[Naval Intelligence headquarters|Republic Center for Military Operations]].<ref name="Catalyst" />

Early in the conflict, the Republic and Confederacy entered into a protracted [[Battle of Malastare|campaign]] on Malastare to control the native [[Dug]]s' greatest resource, [[Malastarian fuel]]. On the occasion of the Republic's ultimate victory in the battle, an ancient and massive [[Zillo Beast]] was awakened. Palpatine was intrigued by the monster's apparent invulnerability to all attacks and so ordered that it be subdued and brought to Coruscant for further study. Upon its arrival on the capital, Amedda joined the Supreme Chancellor and [[Doctor]] [[Sionver Boll]] to witness the beast's transfer to a research facility in the [[Republic Science and Technical Center]]. The chancellor hoped to study and replicate the monster's armor for use in the Grand Army, but Doctor Boll admitted it would be impossible to do so without removing the scales from the beast. Although Amedda cautioned Palpatine on his approach, the chancellor decided to have the Zillo Beast killed so its secrets could be unlocked.<ref name="ZBSB">{{TCW|The Zillo Beast Strikes Back}}</ref>

The Jedi, who were involved in its original capture on Malastare, were opposed to the beast's presence on Coruscant and the plan to kill it for the sake of study. On the Jedi Council's behalf, Senator Padm√© Amidala and Jedi Knight [[Anakin Skywalker]] called a meeting with Amedda and Palpatine in the [[Senate Office Building]] to discuss the issue. Amedda was largely dismissive of Amidala's concerns, but he and the chancellor were able to convince Skywalker that the decision to kill the Zillo Beast was in the best interest of the war effort. During the meeting, Amedda received word from Doctor Boll that she had managed to synthesize Malastarian fuel into a toxic gas that could hypothetically kill the monster. Palpatine gave the order to execute the beast, but the endeavor was unsuccessful; the Zillo became agitated by the gas and broke free from the Science and Technical Center to [[Zillo Beast incident|rampage]] across the Coruscant [[Ecumenopolis|cityscape]]. The beast was finally destroyed by Republic and Jedi forces when it attacked the Senate Office Building and endangered Chancellor Palpatine and Senator Amidala.<ref name="ZBSB" />

Shortly after the [[Second Battle of Geonosis]] in the [[21 BBY|second year]] of the war, the Strategic Advisory Cell began holding weekly briefings on its projects. During the second of these briefings, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine joined Mas Amedda to present to the council impressive but incomplete [[Death Star plans|designs]] for a massive deep-space mobile [[battle station]] that would later be known as the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]]. Although the ambitious plans were allegedly created by the Separatists on Geonosis before falling into Republic hands, the captured [[Geonosian]] [[Archduke]] [[Poggle the Lesser]] insisted that the Confederacy was not building the station. Nevertheless, the Republic intelligence community disagreed, allowing Palpatine and Amedda to use the threat of a Confederate battle platform to secure funding and launch the development of the planet-killer [[superweapon]] for the Republic using the same design. The early stages of the project were carried out under the administration of the Vice Chair and the Strategic Advisory Cell, with specific design and oversight tasks delegated to subcommittees and member agencies.<ref name="Catalyst" />

[[File:Death Star-RO U Visual Guide.png|thumb|right|230px|Development of the Death Star began under Amedda's coordination of the Strategic Advisory Cell.]]
Within several months, construction in the now-restricted [[Geonosis system]] was well underway, with project member Doctor [[Gubacher]] reporting at a Strategic Advisory Cell briefing that labor [[droid]]s had completed the station's prime meridian. Although the gathered members of the Cell were eager to discuss the acquisition of a [[Sentience|sentient]] labor force for the interior of the station, Amedda pushed on to one of the key design gaps in the original plan: the superstructure's primary weapon. The cell was still uncertain what variety of weapon the Confederacy had intended on installing into the station's primary array, and Special Weapons Group lead [[scientist]] [[Professor]] [[Sahali]] insisted to Amedda that planet-killing armament on that scale would require a scientific breakthrough.<ref name="Catalyst" />

Shortly after the briefing, Amedda met with Lieutenant Commander Krennic, who was now the coordinator of the Special Weapons Group's scientific researchers. Krennic was eager to impress the Vice Chair and exert greater influence over the project, and so suggested to Amedda that his team required the participation of [[Galen Walton Erso|Galen Erso]], a noted polymath and academic authority on energy enhancement. Although Amedda was skeptical, Krennic explained that Erso had been under the employ of [[Zerpen Industries]] and nearing a breakthrough in [[kyber crystal]] energy output. Erso had been captured months prior when Separatist proxies staged a coup on Vallt, accusing the scientist of espionage. The Vice Chair was inclined to dismiss the importance of an anti-war neutralist researcher, but Krennic convinced him that if the Republic did not rescue and recruit Erso, the Confederacy would coerce him into service. Amedda remained wary but gave implicit consent to Lieutenant Commander Krennic to arrange for Erso's release.<ref name="Catalyst" />

=====Neutralist affairs=====
{{Quote|It proves what I've been saying all along&mdash;Death Watch is out of control. The Republic must step in and help.''"<br />"''No, wait! I didn't&mdash;''"<br />"''You can't keep them reined in, obviously, so we will.|Mas Amedda and Duchess Satine Kryze of Mandalore|Duchess of Mandalore}}
Throughout the Clone Wars, the Republic struggled with a number of systems that, despite being members of the Senate, resisted any participation in the war effort and openly rejected Jedi and military assistance. These worlds banded together in the [[Council of Neutral Systems]] under the leadership of [[Duke|Duchess]] [[Satine Kryze]] of [[Mandalore]], who was particularly critical of the Republic's increasing militarism. However, when agents of the [[Mandalorian]] [[Death Watch]] [[terrorist]] organization allied with the Confederacy and threatened to topple Kryze's [[New Mandalorians|government]], Amedda and Palpatine pushed the Senate to [[Mandalore Defense Resolution|authorize]] an occupation of Mandalore.<ref name="TCW:DoM">{{TCW|Duchess of Mandalore}}</ref>

During a session of the wartime Senate, Amedda presided over the chamber as senators debated the potential threat that Death Watch posed to the people of Mandalore and the virtue of a Republic occupation. Duchess Kryze, having traveled to Coruscant to attend the session, forcefully argued against intervention and asserted the right of her people to remain neutral in the war. Speaking from the podium, Amedda dismissed her claims as unreasonable idealism, but Kryze held firm. Ultimately, Palpatine and Amedda won the debate when they presented to the Senate a prerecorded [[Hologram|holographic]] testimony from the late Mandalorian [[Deputy Minister]] [[Jerec (Deputy Minister)|Jerec]]. Although Jerec was an ally of the Duchess, his testimony&mdash;which had been doctored as part Sidious's scheme to drag Mandalore into the war&mdash;claimed that the Republic military needed to intervene as Kryze was unwilling to admit that her pacifist crusade had failed.<ref name="TCW:DoM" />

[[File:PalpandMas-DoM.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Amedda and Palpatine hear the testimony of Duchess Satine Kryze.]]
The vote on the resolution to invade Mandalore was scheduled for the following day, but after an [[Plot to assassinate Satine Kryze|attempt]] on Kryze's life, Amedda and Palpatine advanced it to that evening. The two of them met with the Duchess during the vote but neglected to inform her that the Senate was currently deciding the fate of her world. Instead, Amedda argued with Kryze that the [[assassin]]ation attempt was further evidence that her administration was incapable of managing the Death Watch threat without Republic assistance. By the time the meeting was over, the Senate had approved the resolution and the Republic military prepared for an invasion of Mandalore.<ref name="TCW:DoM" />

That night, Kryze was accused of murder when [[Davu Golec|an informant]] was [[Death|killed]] after providing her with Jerec's undoctored testimony. The Duchess went into hiding overnight but was able to deliver the [[Hologram disc|holodisc]] to Senator Amidala, who presented Deputy Minister Jerec's true testimony to the Senate the following day. The undoctored footage proved that Jerec had in fact supported Mandalore's neutrality and Duchess Kryze, a revelation that convinced the Senate to rescind the approval for occupation. In the aftermath of their defeat on the Mandalore issue, the Vice Chair and Chancellor met with Kryze, Amidala, and the Jedi to offer the Duchess a formal apology. The two then joined Senator Amidala to discuss the logistics of ratifying the Senate's vote.<ref name="TCW:DoM" />

Amedda later presided over congressional sessions focused on the Trade Federation's [[Blockade of Pantora|blockade]] of [[Pantora]], wherein [[Pantoran]] senator [[Riyo Chuchi]] argued before the Senate that the Federation was working in league with the Confederacy to persuade her people to secede from the Republic. Federation representative Lott Dod denied the claims, falsely asserting that, as neutralists, the conglomerate's affiliation with the Separatists remained strictly commercial and that the blockade was merely an effort to force Pantora to fulfill its trade debts. Amedda and Palpatine were again present when, days later, Dod was forced to apologize to Chuchi when it came to light that the blockade was indeed a scheme orchestrated by Trade Federation [[Viceroy]] and [[Separatist Council]] member [[Nute Gunray]].<ref name="TCW:SoI">{{TCW|Sphere of Influence}}</ref>

Construction on the [[Death Star]] continued, but Amedda was growing increasingly cynical about Orson Krennic's endeavors. Following their discussion about Galen Erso, Krennic had enlisted [[Republic Intelligence]] operatives and naval forces to perform a [[Rescue of Galen Erso|prisoner swap and assault]] on Vallt. Despite the effort, Erso had still not consented to join the Special Weapons Group and furthermore, Krennic had met with and discussed the battlestation with the captive Poggle the Lesser without prior approval. Amedda confronted the Lieutenant Commander after a Strategic Advisory Cell briefing, demanding to know who authorized him to launch an attack on Vallt. Krennic explained that the sector admiral had given the green light in accordance with a deal struck with the neutralist Zerpin Industries. The Vice Chair conceded that the recapture of Vallt was of strategic benefit to the Republic, but still scolded Krennic for neglecting the chain of command, meeting with the Geonosian archduke, and failing to recruit Erso into the project. To Amedda's surprise, Krennic had levied the meeting with Poggle into an arrangement wherein the Geonosian would be returned to his homeworld in exchange for his people serving as a labor force in the orbiting Death Star construction site. The Erso situation proved more complex, as the pacifist scientist was staunchly opposed to military work, but Krennic assured Amedda that the doctor would soon join the cause.<ref name="Catalyst" />

=====Deregulation and defense spending=====
{{Quote|Let us now vote on Senator Burtoni's bill to fund five million additional clones.''"<br />"''The opposition to this bill must be allowed to speak first!|Mas Amedda and Senator Mon Mothma|Pursuit of Peace}}
As the Clone Wars dragged on and became increasingly costly for the Republic, Amedda worked closely with the militarist wing of the Senate, who pushed aggressively to further fund the war effort. Discussion in congress was largely focused on the economic stability of the government under the strain of war and Amedda presided over one such debate addressing an [[Republic financial reform bill|emergency financial reform bill]] proposed by [[Techno Union]] representative [[Gume Saam]]. The Vice Chair attempted to moderate the raucous argument over the legislation&mdash;which would open new lines of credit to finance the war by deregulating the galactic banking industry&mdash;but fiscal conservative senators like [[Bail Organa]] of Alderaan and defense hawks like [[Halle Burtoni]] of Kamino filled the chamber with crosstalk. Although Senator Amidala was able to seize the floor, her suggestion that the Republic sue for peace with the Confederacy was shouted down. Amedda ended the session after a motion from Organa called for further study on the deregulation question before a vote was conducted.<ref name="TCW:HoBS">{{TCW|Heroes on Both Sides}}</ref>

[[File:AmeddaTanoPalpatineAmidala-HoBS.jpeg|thumb|right|280px|Amedda and Palpatine discuss the Separatist peace initiative with Senator Amidala and Padawan Tano.]]
Days later, Amedda and Palpatine met with Amidala and Jedi [[Padawan]] [[Ahsoka Tano]] in the chancellor's office, where the Naboo senator reported that the [[Separatist Senate|Separatist Parliament]] had voted to advance a [[Confederate‚ÄìRepublic peace initiative|peace initiative]] with the Republic. The Chancellor attempted to convince Amidala that any talk of peace among the Separatists was disingenuous, but Amidala revealed that she had personally coordinated the vote with her her former colleague, Separatist Senator [[Mina Bonteri]]. Palpatine and Amedda agreed to hold a vote on the peace initiative, but the Dark Lord of the Sith had already put plans into motion that would derail any move to end the war and ensure the passage of the deregulation bill.<ref name="TCW:HoBS" />

When the Senate reconvened to vote on Senator Saam's measure, it appeared as though news of the Separatist's peace movement had convinced the congress that bank deregulation and further war funding was unnecessary. However, just as Amedda called for the legislators to vote on the bill, explosions rocked the [[Federal District|Senate District]] and mass blackouts spread across Coruscant. The Senate took a short recess before reconvening under emergency lighting, where it was revealed that the bombing was a [[Bombing of Coruscant's central power distribution grid|terrorist attack]] carried out on the ecumenopolis's [[central power distribution grid]] by Confederate [[demolition droid]]s. Amidala continued her anti-war plea, but the Vice Chair declared that the Separatist peace initiative was an obvious ploy to distract from terrorist activities. The Senate was incensed, which allowed Palpatine to call for approval of the financial reform bill,<ref name="TCW:HoBS" /> ensuring its overwhelming approval.<ref name="TCW:PoP">{{TCW|Pursuit of Peace}}</ref>

The following day, Amedda and Palpatine convened the Senate to formally respond to the Separatist peace offer and the bombing. Amidala refused to give up her crusade, but the congress had largely turned against prospect of peace. Instead, Senator Burtoni proposed a [[Republic military enhancement bill|bill of her own]], which would authorize the purchase of five million additional [[Clone trooper]]s by securing a loan from the now-deregulated [[InterGalactic Banking Clan]]. Amedda interrupted debate over the measure by informing the Chancellor that a communique had been received from Count Dooku, in which the Confederate [[Head of State]] accused the Republic of [[Attack on Confederate people|assassinating]] Mina Bonteri, the architect of the Separatist peace movement. In the aftermath, the Chancellor and Vice Chair ushered the Senate towards approving the defense appropriations bill;<ref name="TCW:PoP" /> Amedda worked with Senators Burtoni, [[Mot-Not Rab]] and [[Mee Deechi]]<ref name="TCW:SM">{{TCW|Senate Murders}}</ref> while Palpatine arranged for opposition representatives to be intimidated by [[Bounty hunter|hired thugs]].<ref name="TCW:PoP" />

[[File:Palpatine_Pursuite_of_Peace.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Palpatine informs Amedda that he will allow the wheels of Senate to turn.]]
When the bill proceeded to the floor, it appeared the legislation would pass easily. Opposition leader Bail Organa had been injured in an intimidation scheme and Amidala's efforts to persuade senators to vote against the bill floundered. Amedda pushed the bill to a vote over the protests of Senator [[Mon Mothma]], but was interrupted by the arrival of Amidala, who intended to speak in Organa's place. Her impassioned plea convinced many across Coruscant to oppose the legislation,<ref name="TCW:PoP" /> but the bill passed regardless.<ref name="TCW:SM" /> In a private meeting after the vote, Palpatine admitted to Amedda that he was troubled by the anti-war senator's ability to sway public opinion.<ref name="TCW:PoP" />

[[File:PhaseIIArmor-SM.png|thumb|right|300px|Amedda views [[Phase II clone trooper armor]] plans with several militarist senators.]]
In the aftermath of the vote, the anti-war faction rallied around Amidala and her ally, [[Rodian]] senator [[Onaconda Farr]], to push a piece of [[Reduced military spending bill|counter-legislation]] that would slash the Republic's defense budget and undo Burtoni's victory. Amedda watched as Amidala delivered yet another well-received speech in support of her legislation, despite the high degree of partisanship in the convocation chamber. Shortly afterward, Senator Farr died of apparent [[heart]] failure, leading to a [[Coruscant Security Force]] investigation and a postponed vote on the new appropriations bill. Amedda attended Farr's [[Funeral of Onaconda Farr|funeral]] alongside the Chancellor and several other senators and dignitaries. After the service, Amedda joined the Chancellor in his office for a meeting with Security Force [[Inspector]] [[Tan Divo]], as well as Senators Amidala, Organa, Mothma, [[Orn Free Taa]], and the Rodian Junior Representative [[Lolo Purs]]. Divo revealed to the gathered leaders that Senaor Farr had been murdered by way of [[poison]], but assured them that he had the investigation under control.<ref name="TCW:SM" />

Amedda continued to meet with Senate leadership and [[Lieutenant]] Divo throughout the investigation. After the Umbaran militarist leader, Senator Mee Deechi, was found murdered in his office, Divo sequestered the congressional leaders and arrested Senator Burtoni for both assassinations. The [[Kaminoan]] was brought before the Chancellor, Vice Chair, and anti-war leadership for a brief interrogation from Divo, who explained to the assembly that forensic evidence showed Farr was killed by a Rodian-specific poison from Kamino. During the arrest, Lolo Purs admitted to having murdered Farr for his previous support for the Confederacy and Deechi for possessing information related to the Farr's assassination. Purs was arrested and Burtoni was released, and the Senate eventually returned to regular business to vote on Amidala and Farr's bill&mdash;which it rejected. The Vice Chair joined the Chancellor's retinue after the vote when Palpatine advised Amidala to trust in the war effort to achieve security.<ref name="TCW:SM" />

In the [[20 BBY|third year]] of the war,<ref name="Atlas">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]''</ref> Palpatine's administration and the Jedi Council were rattled by reports that Dooku had hired criminal mastermind [[Moralo Eval]] to kidnap the Supreme Chancellor. Eval was preemptively captured by Republic forces and imprisoned at the [[Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center]], but Amedda and Palpatine were still subjected to enhanced security from the [[501st Legion]] and [[Coruscant Guard]]. Eval [[Riot at the Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center|escaped]] the Detention Center days before the Vice Chair and Chancellor were scheduled to travel to Naboo for the [[Festival of Light]], but the Chancellor remained committed to making the trip despite the obvious danger.<ref name="TCW:FaE">{{TCW|Friends and Enemies}}</ref>

[[File:Mas Naboo.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Mas Amedda with Generals Windu and Skywalker, Chancellor Palpatine, Senator Amidala, and Queen Neeyutnee in Theed on Naboo]]
Amedda and Palpatine were escorted to Naboo by [[Jedi Master]] [[Mace Windu]], Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, and a contingent of [[clone shock trooper]]s aboard a Jedi [[T-6 shuttle]]. Upon arrival in the capital city of [[Theed]], they were met by Queen [[Neeyutnee]], [[Governor]] [[Sio Bibble]], and Senators Amidala and Organa as security and boarding arrangements were finalized. At the ceremony that evening, Amedda and the other dignitaries joined Palpatine on a scenic overlook outside of [[Theed Royal Palace]], where the Supreme Chancellor delivered a speech to commemorate Naboo's entry into the Republic. Although the gathering was protected by [[Senate Guard]]s, shock troopers, Jedi, and a [[ray shield]], [[Derrown|one]] of Eval's bounty hunter associates managed to detonate the [[Deflector shield generator|shield generator]], thereby throwing the crowd into a panic. While Amedda and other high-value guests were escorted away by Tano, the Jedi foiled Eval's [[Skirmish in Theed|kidnapping plot]] and arrested the bounty hunter perpetrators. The following morning, Amedda returned to Coruscant alongside most of the chancellor's security retinue.<ref name="TCW:CoN">{{TCW|Crisis on Naboo}}</ref>

[[File:Prepare_my_ship.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Palpatine orders Amedda to have his ship prepared.]]
In his private role as attendant to the Dark Lord of the Sith, Amedda was by Darth Sidious's side as news circulated that the former [[Sith apprentice]], [[Maul|Darth Maul]], was alive and building a [[Shadow Collective|shadow army]] to challenge the Jedi, Sith, Republic, and Confederacy in the [[19 BBY|final year]] of the war. The Dark Lord was deeply troubled by this development and so asked Amedda to arrange [[Darth Sidious' shuttle|secret transport]] to Mandalore, which had been taken over by Maul.<ref name="TCW:Lawless">{{TCW|The Lawless}}</ref> A short time later, Amedda joined a congressional delegation and military representatives to attend [[Funeral of the Jedi Temple bombing victims|funerary services]] for six Jedi who were killed in a [[Bombing of the Jedi Temple hangar|terrorist bombing]] of the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]].<ref name="TCW:TJWKTM">{{TCW|The Jedi Who Knew Too Much}}</ref> Padawan Ahsoka Tano was later [[Capture of Ahsoka Tano|arrested]] for the crime and [[Exile|excommunicated]] from the Jedi Order, allowing for her to be [[Trial of Ahsoka Tano|tried]] before a Republic Military&ndash;Senate tribunal. Mas Amedda served as a bailiff for the court, calling it to order under Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, who served as judge. Although Senator Amidala spoke passionately as defense litigator, she and Tano were unable to answer many of the accusations levied by the prosecution, represented by [[admiral]]<ref name="TCW:TWJ">{{TCW|The Wrong Jedi}}</ref> and [[Adjutant General|adjutant general]],<ref name="Catalyst" /> [[Wilhuff Tarkin]]. Just as a jury of senators transmitted their verdict to the Vice Chair, the proceedings were interrupted by Anakin Skywalker, who claimed to have identified the true culprit: Jedi Padawan [[Barriss Offee]]. Offee admitted to the bombing before the tribunal and was taken into custody while Tano was released.<ref name="TCW:TWJ" />

Amedda was again involved in Sidious's conspiracies to subvert the Jedi when clone trooper [[CT-5385]] executed Jedi General [[Tiplar]] at the [[Battle of Ringo Vinda]], seemingly unwarranted. After the clone fell into a state of psychosis and died, it was revealed that [[Advanced Recon Commando]] [[CT-5555]] had removed the [[Control chip|inhibitor chips]] that Kaminoans implanted in the [[brain]]s of all clones at birth. On Palpatine's orders, he was transported to the [[Grand Republic Medical Facility]] on Coruscant; Mas Amedda was at the facility to greet the clone and his escort, Jedi Master [[Shaak Ti]] and Kaminoan [[Chief Medical Scientist]] [[Nala Se]]. The Vice Chair led the party into an operating theater where the Supreme Chancellor waited to hear directly from the clone, Jedi, and Kaminoan. After a brief discussion on the cause of CT-5385's breakdown, Amedda escorted Ti and Se from the room so Palpatine could speak privately with CT-5555. When the three of them heard a violent clatter from within the operating theater, they rushed back in to find the clone attempting to assassinate the chancellor. CT-5555 [[Escape from the Grand Republic Medical Facility|escaped]], but Palpatine retrieved what he needed: the extracted clone inhibitor chips. Unbeknownst to both the Jedi and the clones, the chips were part of Sidious's plan to turn the Grand Army against the Order. After CT-5555 was [[Mission to Level 1325|found and killed]], Amedda joined Palpatine in a meeting with members of the Jedi Council, where the two of them presented false information on the cause of the clone's breakdowns, thereby protecting the Dark Lord's plot.<ref name="TCW:Orders">{{TCW|Orders}}</ref>

====Rise of the New Order====
=====Early nationalization=====
{{Quote|I believe that in these dangerous times, the Bank must be protected at all costs. And a man who has no allegiance to either side, and the support of the Muun people, is our best hope.''"<br />"''Then we shall put it to a vote.''[&hellip;] ''A resounding majority in support of the nomination!|Palpatine and Amedda arrange for the installation of Clovis as head of the Banking Clan|The Rise of Clovis}}
In the advanced stages of the Clone Wars, Palpatine and Amedda moved aggressively to centralize significant swaths of the the Republic's government and economy into the authority of the Chancellor's Office. The administration found a [[Nationalization of the InterGalactic Banking Clan|major victory]] in this effort when Darth Sidious targeted the InterGalactic Banking Clan, which controlled the galactic banking industry and operated under the purview of the [[Muun government]] with legal oversight from the Republic and Confederacy. In a carefully orchestrated scheme by the Sith, Senator Amidala and disgraced former senator-turned-Banking Clan adjudicator [[Rush Clovis]] revealed that efforts to secure funding for the supreme chancellor's refugee initiative had uncovered evidence showing that the Banking Clan was defrauding its clients; the banks' [[Main Vault fortress|main vault]] had been emptied by the the Banking Clan's [[Muun]] leadership, the [[Core Five]], and loans to both the Republic and Confederacy were financed exclusively by the paid interest from the opposing sides. Further, the Separatists began altogether refusing to repay the interest on their loans, threatening complete economic collapse. Amedda was present at a meeting in the Chancellor's Office, where Palpatine, the Jedi Council, and Senator Organa were briefed on the situation my Amidala and Clovis. Although the files indicating fraud were damning, distrust of Clovis and a lack of evidence on the secret accounts receiving the embezzled funds spurred only an investigation into the matter.<ref name="TCW:RoC">{{TCW|The Rise of Clovis}}</ref>

Sidious's machinations allowed the investigation to uncover the secret accounts, and a short time later Amedda was again in a meeting with the chancellor, Amidala, and Clovis. This time, they were joined by Banking Clan official [[Mak Plain]] and representatives from the Muun government who reported that the Core Five had been arrested on the evidence provided by Clovis's investigation. Following the meeting, the Vice Chair presided over a Senate session wherein Clovis testified against the Banking Clan leadership and asked for a formal nomination to take control of the Clan from the Core Five.<ref name="TCW:RoC" /> Despite having been implicated in a treason plot with Lott Dod prior to the Second Battle of Geonosis,<ref name="TCW:SS">{{TCW|Senate Spy}}</ref> Clovis's candidacy was championed by Amidala, who claimed that the former senator was the only figure who could be approved by both the Republic and Confederacy.<ref name="TCW:RoC" />

Despite significant misgivings about Clovis's allegiance, endorsements from the Muuns and the supreme chancellor pushed the Senate to overwhelmingly approve him as the new head of the Banking Clan. Amedda announced the results of the vote, which was ratified by the Separatist Parliament.<ref name="TCW:RoC" /> The new InterGalactic Banking Clan [[chairman]] returned to the Bank's headquarters on [[Scipio]], where he seized control from the Core Five and quickly declared a significant interest rate hike on Republic loans. News of the hike quickly reached Coruscant, where the Amedda and Palpatine convened the Senate to discuss the development. The congress was irate, with senators declaring that the sudden rate hike proved Clovis's loyalty to the Separatists. The debate only grew more heated by news that the Banking Clan would not be imposing any similar rate hike on Confederate loans. After the session, Amedda returned to the Chancellor's office with Palpatine and General Skywalker, where the three men received a transmission from Senator Amidala. Amidala had returned to Scipio with Clovis to represent the Republic's interests, but was now reporting that the [[Separatist navy]] had [[Invasion of Scipio|invaded]] the planet in an apparent effort to seize control of the banks with Clovis's assistance. When Amidala was taken into Confederate custody on-camera, Amedda rushed to invoke an emergency session of the Senate so the legislature could approve a military intervention on Scipio.<ref name="TCW:CatH">{{TCW|Crisis at the Heart}}</ref>

The Senate approved the intervention, which saw the Separatists rooted out of the Banking Clan's headquarters and Rush Clovis killed. In a senate session after the upheaval, Amedda and Palpatine watched as Clovis was posthumously blamed for the corruption in the banks and the crisis that followed. Senator [[Nix Card]] announced to the assembled senators that, in the interest of economic stability, the Muun government was ceding control of the InterGalactic Banking Clan to the Office of the Supreme Chancellor. The decision was met with broad approval in light of the chancellor's promises to restore the banks at the end of the Clone Wars, despite the fact that nationalization of the galactic financial industry was yet another step towards the authoritarian rule Palpatine and Amedda desired.<ref name="TCW:CatH" />

Amedda was later present when Queen [[Julia]] of the neutral world of [[Bardotta]] appealed to the Senate for diplomatic aid via holographic transmission. The chancellor and vice chair were puzzled when Julia rejected Senators Amidala and Organa as ambassadors and instead demanded that Representative Jar Jar Binks be sent to handle the [[Mission to Bardota|affair]].<ref name="TCW:TD1">{{TCW|The Disappeared, Part I}}</ref>

=====Death of the Republic=====

Amedda remained by Palpatine's side as the Dark Lord's machinations reached their endgame at the height of the war. Under Sidious's direction, Count Dooku and the Confederate General [[Grievous]] swept into Coruscant with a massive naval force and kidnapped the supreme chancellor. Before they were able to abscond with the Republic head of state, the Separatist fleet was interdicted by the Republic Navy and Palpatine was rescued by General Skywalker. Dooku was killed in the conflict, but the war carried on while the Senate continued to vote to give the Chancellor's Office increasingly significant powers to end the war. Days after the [[Battle of Coruscant]], Amedda joined Chancellor Palpatine, Sly Moore, and Senator [[Sweitt Concorkill]] at the [[Galaxies Opera House]] in the [[Uscru District]] for an evening of theater. During a showing of the [[Mon Calamari]] ballet ''[[Squid Lake]]'', the four politicians were joined in their private box by General Skywalker, who had come to the opera house at the chancellor's request. While discussing the location of General Grievous and the remaining Separatist leadership, Palpatine dismissed Amedda, Moore, and Concorkill so he could confer privately with the young Jedi Knight.<ref name="Episode III">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref>

A brief time later, General Grievous was killed on [[Utapau]] in an [[Battle of Utapau|action]] that was intended by the Jedi to end the war. Although Palpatine had publicly promised to push for an end to hostilities on the occasion of the general's death, it was simultaneously revealed to the Jedi Order that the supreme chancellor was secretly the Dark Lord of the Sith who had been manipulating events throughout the Clone Wars and long before. The Jedi Council's [[Duel in Palpatine's office|attempt]] to arrest Palpatine for his crimes ended in disaster; the four arresting Jedi Masters were killed and Anakin Skywalker joined the Dark Lord as his new Sith apprentice, Darth Vader. In the immediate aftermath, Palpatine declared the Jedi enemies of the state and activated [[Order 66]]&mdash;a clone protocol programmed into their inhibitor chips that marked all Jedi for execution.<ref name="Episode III" />

[[File:Declaration.png|thumb|left|300px|Amedda and Moore stood by Palpatine's side as the Dark Lord declared a New Order.]]
With the Senate marginalized and the Jedi purged, the supreme chancellor moved to end the war by sending Darth Vader to [[Mission to Mustafar|hunt down and kill]] remaining Separatist leadership on [[Mustafar]]. In preparation for this finale to the Clone Wars, Amedda invoked an extraordinary session of the Senate and personally called upon members to assure their attendance. In what became known as the first [[Empire Day]], Palpatine&mdash;heavily deformed by his battle with the Jedi&mdash;stood before the Senate alongside Mas Amedda and Sly Moore to issue the [[Proclamation of the New Order]], which formally ended the war, branded the Jedi as traitors, and transformed the Republic into the [[Galactic Empire|First Galactic Empire]].<ref name="Episode III" />

After the Proclamation, Amedda joined Sidious in the [[Senate holding office|holding office]] beneath the Senate Chamber and watched as the newly-minted [[Galactic Emperor]] conferred via hologram with Darth Vader. The two were taken by surprise when Grand Master Yoda, who had survived Order 66, entered the chamber and quickly dispatched the two [[Emperor's Royal Guard|Imperial Guards]] stationed to protect the new Empire's leadership. The Emperor assaulted Yoda with a blast of [[The Force|Force]] [[Force lightning|energy]], throwing the diminutive [[alien]] across the room and allowing Amedda the opportunity to depart with confidence that the Sith would best the Jedi. The [[Duel in the Galactic Senate|contest]] between Darth Sidious and Yoda laid waist to the Senate Chamber's interior, but Jedi's last-ditch effort to avoid extinction was met with failure. Amedda joined the Emperor in the Senate to help coordinate the search for the assailant, but [[Clone Commander]] [[CC-4477|Thire's]] report that Yoda's body could not be found convinced Amedda the Jedi was still alive. During the search, the Emperor ordered Amedda to contact his [[Theta-class T-2c shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] [[pilot]], [[Captain]] [[Kagi]], to prepare for travel to Mustafar.<ref name="Episode III" />

Following Vader's recovery, Amedda spoke at a large public rally outside the former Jedi Temple to [[Celebration of the eradication of the Jedi Order|commemorate]] the Order's eradication. The Chagrian's speech proclaimed the Jedi's oppression and treachery to be over at the hands of Emperor Palpatine and heralded an "age of freedom" for the galaxy. In conjunction with the fiery address, Imperial [[stormtrooper]]s dumped a basket of confiscated lightsabers into a large incinerator to be burned before the gathered crowd. Amedda himself added [[Yoda's lightsaber]], lost by the Jedi Master during the duel in the Senate, to the crucible. The public demonstration ended after the kyber crystals in the lightsabers produced a large energy discharge from within the inferno.<ref name="Chosen 1, Part 1">''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 1: The Chosen One, Part I]]''</ref>

Amedda was present in the [[Emperor's office]] some time later as [[Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin|Tarkin]] reported on the progress of the Death Star's construction to the Emperor. The Grand Vizier asked Tarkin of the superlaser, to which Moff began to state that early tests were successful. Suddenly the two [[Emperor's Royal Guard|Royal guards]] where thrown against the office window, startling Amedda who then saw the heavily injured figure of Darth Vader. Amedda was then ordered by the Emperor to leave the office along with Tarkin.<ref name="Darth Vader 5">''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 5: The Chosen One, Part V]]''</ref>

In these early days of the [[Imperial Era|Age of the Empire]], the civil government and military superstructure of the Old Republic were overhauled under the direction of Emperor Palpatine and Mas Amedda, who had transitioned from Vice Chair of the Senate to [[Grand Vizier]] of the Galactic Empire. As Vizier, Amedda acted as an intermediary for the increasingly reclusive Emperor,<ref name="Tarkin" /> the primary administrator of the massive Imperial bureaucracy,<ref name="Empire's End" /> and the leader of the [[Imperial Ruling Council]].<ref name="Tarkin" /> The Ruling Council&mdash;consisting of Amedda and a handful of aids and sycophants from Palpatine's days as senator and supreme chancellor&mdash;handled the day-to-day governance of the Empire while the Emperor himself focused largely on matters of the Force and the rapidly expanding [[Imperial Military]].<ref name="Tarkin" /> Much of Amedda's work shifted from the Senate Building to a temporary office in the old Jedi Temple, which was quickly being renovated into the new Imperial Palace.<ref name="Catalyst" /> Meanwhile, the [[Imperial Senate]] became an increasingly irrelevant body as the Emperor's new regional governors, known as [[Moff]]s, liaised directly with the regime through Amedda.<ref name="Tarkin" />

Throughout this period, the Emperor sent his private [[yacht]], the ''[[Imperialis]]'', to remote worlds to have droids, advisers, or his Jedi-hunting [[Inquisitorius|Inquisitors]] carry out clandestine plans. After one of these trips, Amedda was introduced to [[Gallius Rax]], a young man who had stowed away aboard the ''Imperialis'' and was now being ushered into the [[Imperial Navy]] by Palpatine himself. During Rax's time at the [[Imperial Academy]] he met with the Grand Vizier and the Emperor, as well as Admirals [[Dodd Rancit]] and [[Terrinald Screed]] of [[Imperial Intelligence]] and [[Colonel]] [[Wullf Yularen]] of the [[Imperial Security Bureau]]. Although Rax's later career with the Naval Intelligence Agency sealed or obscured most of his record, an image of his meeting with the Grand Vizier and the intelligence chiefs was stored in the [[Hall of Imperial Register]] on Coruscant.<ref name="Life Debt">''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]''</ref>

[[File:YoungOrson.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Orson Krennic was eager to prove himself to Amedda, but frequently overstepped his bounds.]]
Despite a series of setbacks late in the Clone Wars, construction on the Death Star continued under the direction of the new Imperial [[Advanced Weapons Research]] agency, led by [[Director]] Orson Krennic. Although Krennic's team now included Galen Erso and had access to kyber crystals previously hoarded by the Jedi Order, the project had moved into a new phase that would require a significant increase in resource procurement&mdash;far beyond what could be inconspicuously gathered from [[Arkanis sector|Geonosis's sector]]. As the Death Star's construction still needed to be hidden from the Senate and the galaxy at large, Amedda approved Krennic's request to seek the necessary materials from select worlds in the lightly-populated [[Western Reaches]],<ref name="Catalyst" /> a region that was subjected to Imperial [[Western Reaches pacification operations|pacification operations]] against [[Separatist holdouts]] since the end of the war.<ref name="Tarkin" /> Following the Grand Vizier's guidance to remain discreet, Krennic targeted the worlds [[Samovar]] and [[Wadi Raffa]], both of which were protected from industrial exploitation by [[Legacy world|Legacy statues]] intended to limit environmental impact. Through the director's manipulations, the limited [[mining]] interests on those worlds were implicated in an arms trafficking plot, thereby allowing the Imperial Military to move in and seize control of the planets' resources.<ref name="Catalyst" />

The team of scientists assigned to design the weapon itself&mdash;then operating under the facade of [[Project Celestial Power]]&mdash;continued to run into stumbling blocks with Erso's research, eventually resulting in a [[Malpaz catastrophe|catastrophic explosion]] at their [[Project Celestial Power facility|facility]] on [[Malpaz]]. Although the research team was saved, the disaster killed tens of thousands of locals and forced Amedda to intervene directly in Krennic's project. Amedda traveled to the Geonosis construction site alongside a retinue of advisers, where he was treated to a shuttle tour of the Death Star's exterior surface by the director himself. Although the superstructure had progressed significantly, Amedda's specific concerns were on the development of the weapon. Krennic tried to assuage the Grand Vizier's displeasure with the situation, but Amedda was insistent that the research teams begin producing results. The Chagrian also chastised Krennic for using Imperial Military assets to seize the mining interests on Samovar and Wadi Raffa without direct prior approval. The Grand Vizier informed Krennic that the Emperor's trust in his ability had eroded, and that the director was now to focus solely on the weapon and forgo efforts to oversee procurement and production. In spite of the rebuke, Krennic still requested a promotion to the rank of [[Rear Admiral]] at the conclusion of the meeting, but Amedda was only willing to entertain the notion of Krennic rising to [[commander]].<ref name="Catalyst" />

[[17 BBY|Two years]] into the Empire's reign, Krennic's team had finally manufactured a [[Special Weapons Group star destroyer|proof-of-concept laser array]] ready for testing. Although Amedda asked that it be test-fired somewhere near Imperial Center in the [[Core Worlds]], Krennic feared a repeat of the Malpaz disaster and so instead tested it in a remote [[Hero Twins|binary black hole system]]. Amedda was appraised that the test was successful and later contacted the director to offer his congratulations and announce the approval of Krennic's promotion to commander. Amedda and the Emperor had hoped that now-Moff Wilhuff Tarkin would become more involved in the Death Star as the [[Project Stardust|project]] entered a new phase, but the governor was embroiled in a surprisingly protracted [[Campaign at Salient|campaign]] to root out [[Partisans|insurgents]] and defiant corporate interests in the [[Salient system]]. The conflict had been secretly arranged by Krennic as part of yet another resource acquisition scheme, but was largely intended to keep Tarkin away from the Death Star and out of the Grand Vizier's good graces.<ref name="Catalyst" />

When the Senate objected to the happenings in the autonomous Salient system, Amedda contacted Moff Tarkin to encourage a retreat from hostilities. It was clear to the Chagrian that the insurgents were destroying the very infrastructure that the Empire hoped to seize, and Tarkin admitted that his marginal success on one of the system's outlying [[Epiphany moon|moons]] was not enough to dissuade Salient's [[Salient's battle group|local defenses]] still garrisoned on the inward planets. Amedda advised Tarkin to conclude his operations before they became any more costly to the Empire, but the governor was insistent that the insurgents be eliminated by his hand. Conversing over jamming efforts by [[Salient Strategic Command]], the two men argued over the value of committing more stormtroopers or the Empire's new [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]] to the campaign. The Grand Vizier ultimately conceded that a victory at Salient was important for the Empire in the [[Corporate Sector]] and so acquiesced to Tarkin's request for reinforcements.<ref name="Catalyst" />

The project was again met with a setback when Galen Erso and his family fled the Special Weapons Group and disappeared. The Grand Vizier and the Emperor held Krennic responsible for the loss and placed Tarkin in charge of the [[Sentinel bases]] that guarded and monitored shipments to the Death Star's construction site. Amedda met with Krennic in his office on Coruscant to inform the director that the governor would monitor his progress on the weapon and that the prior promotion to commander was being rescinded. Despite Krennic's assurances to the Grand Vizier that his research teams could make up for the loss of Erso, development on the planet-destroying [[superlaser]] would stall for a further five years<ref name="RogueOne">''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''</ref>.<ref name="Catalyst" /> while construction continued under the watchful eye of Moff Tarkin.<ref name="Tarkin" />

In the years following the Proclamation of the New Order, Amedda and the Ruling Council became increasingly powerful actors in galactic governance as the historically oppressive reign of the the Empire expanded far beyond the borders of the former Republic and Confederacy. As proxies for the Emperor, Council members had oversight of military matters as well as those of the Empire's intelligence services&mdash;the Imperial Security Bureau (ISB) as part of the [[Commission for the Preservation of the New Order]] (COMPNOR) and Imperial Intelligence. In [[14 BBY]], five years into the Empire's rule, the Imperial Security Bureau reported to the Grand Vizier that one of their assets on the former Confederate world of [[Murkhana]] had discovered a large cache of sophisticated equipment capable of sabotaging or hijacking [[HoloNet]] signals and broadcasts. Although the Bureau typically handled matters related to dissident propaganda and communications, Amedda urged ISB [[Deputy Director]] [[Harus Ison]] to involve the Ruling Council and the newly-formed [[Naval Intelligence Agency|Naval Intelligence]] branch of Imperial Intelligence in the response.<ref name="Tarkin" />

[[File:Grand_Vizier_Amedda.png|thumb|right|200px|Mas Amedda, Grand Vizier of the Galactic Empire.]]
Three weeks after the cache was discovered, Amedda contacted Moff Tarkin on [[Sentinel Base]] to inform the governor that the his presence was required on Coruscant. Tarkin was hesitant to leave his command as the base had recently come [[Attack on Sentinel Base|under attack]] from unidentified parties, but Amedda clarified that refusal was not an option as the request came from the Emperor himself. The Grand Vizier and a phalanx of Imperial Guards greeted the Moff upon his arrival at the capital and guided him through the completely renovated Imperial Palace. Before meeting with the Emperor himself, Amedda took Tarkin to a palace courtroom, where Darth Vader&mdash;now confined to identity-obscuring [[Vader's armor|cybernetic armor]]&mdash;was holding court. Alongside Harus Ison and the Coruscant Security Force [[Prefect (Coruscant police)|Prefect]] [[Phoca Soot]], Vader harangued a group of underworld miscreants for their overreach and executed Soot for corruption. Amedda was irritated by the bloody killing and asked Vader to consider patience before personally executing the accused, but the Sith Lord dismissed the request.<ref name="Tarkin" />

After Tarkin met with the Emperor, Amedda presided over a meeting wherein the heads of the intelligence community briefed the Emperor, the Ruling Council, Tarkin, and Vader on the Murkhana discovery. Deputy Director Ison and Colonel Yularen of the ISB explained the discovery of the cache and argued that the equipment was likely gathered by political dissidents planning a propaganda campaign against the Empire. Admirals Dodd Rancit and Terrinald Screed disagreed with the assessment and asserted instead that the Naval Intelligence Agency should lead the investigation, as the cache could point to a military threat against the Empire. As the briefing devolved into bickering between the intelligence chiefs, Amedda called for Tarkin to testify on the recent attack against Sentinel Base. The attack had involved falsified HoloNet transmissions indicating a possible connection to the Murkhana cache, leading most in the meeting to conclude that the situation was beyond the scope of the Security Bureau. Amedda closed the meeting, declaring that the Emperor would consider the issue.<ref name="Tarkin" />

Palpatine ultimately elected to send Tarkin and Vader to Murkhana together to investigate the cache, thereby sidestepping the rivalries between the intelligence chiefs. Amedda gave the Moff his [[Mission to Murkhana|mission]] and, at the Emperor's behest, said nothing of who would be in command. The Vizier later informed the Emperor that Tarkin was displeased with the assignment; Vader was similarly displeased but the two followed their orders and traveled to Murkhana aboard the ''[[Carrion Spike]]'', Tarkin's personal warship.<ref name="Tarkin" />

Once the ''Carrion Spike'' was shipjacked by [[Berch Teller's rebel cell|insurgents]] and used to [[Attack on Galidraan Station|attack]] [[Galidraan Station]], Amedda and [[Ars Dangor]] were dispatched by the Emperor to meet with the intelligence officers Ison, Dodd Rancit and Screed, where he was angered at their recommendation to let the ''Carrion'' go and told them of the threat of dissidence, when the report of an [[Attack on Lucazec|attack]] on [[Lucazec]] arrived. As the situation progressed, Amedda continued to meet with the Ruling Council and the Emperor, who eventually asked him to summon the ISB agents responsible for the Murkhana discovery. As the Emperor interrogated [[Bracchia]] and [[Stellan]], Amedda, [[11-4D]] and a pair of Royal Guards listened to Sidious, who discovered the dubious involvement of [[Vice Admiral]] Rancit with the insurgents.<ref name="Tarkin" />

Fourteen years after the rise of the Empire, Amedda continued to hold the position of Grand Vizier. At one point, as the Emperor was unavailable, Amedda received Governor [[Arihnda Pryce]] from [[Lothal]] to discuss Lothal's industrial and mining sectors on her visit to Coruscant.<ref name="HoloNet News">{{HoloNetNews|post/98908548684/holonet-news-exclusive-mas-amedda-receives|Exclusive: Mas Amedda receives Governor Arihnda Pryce for Lothal report|int=HoloNet News Exclusive: Mas Amedda receives Governor Arihnda Pryce for Lothal report}}</ref>

====Galactic Civil War====
{{Quote|You do understand what will happen to you if you do not recover that ship, Commander Pasqual.''"<br />"''Of course, my Lord Amedda.|Amedda warns Pasqual not to fail in recovering the Emperor's ship|Lando, Part I}}
[[File:Amedda Pasqual.png|thumb|left|230px|Amedda is informed by Pasqual of the theft of the ''Imperialis'']]
Some time after the Empire's Death Star was destroyed by the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]], a rebel organization created to fight back against the Empire, at the [[Battle of Yavin]]. During the turmoil, Amedda was contacted on Coruscant by Commander [[Pasqual]], informing him that the Emperor's pleasure craft, ''Imperialis'', which was docked at [[Sienar Fleet Systems]] [[Orbital Shipyard CC-24]] above the [[Colonies]] world of [[Castell]], had been [[Theft of the Imperialis|stolen]]. Amedda ordered Pasqual to recover the [[Starship|ship]] at once, reminding him that he had already failed in keeping the ship secured. Amedda went before Emperor Palpatine, and informed him of his ship's theft.<ref name="Lando 1">''[[Lando, Part I]]''</ref>

====Emperor ''de jure''====
{{Quote|You''&hellip;''you're serious. You want me to surrender''&hellip;''the entire Galactic Empire?''"<br />"''That's right.''"<br />"''I don't''&hellip;"<br />"''You don't have the power, do you?''"<br />"''I''&hellip;"<br />"''So, get it back. And then bring a treaty to our door.|Grand Vizier Mas Amedda and Senator Leia Organa, on Velusia|Aftermath: Life Debt}}
Amedda had the massive task of keeping the Empire together after Palpatine's death at the [[Battle of Endor]]<ref name="Lost Stars">''[[Lost Stars]]''</ref>, acting as proxy Emperor. In reality, he held little real influence beyond the throneworld of Coruscant. His reign was troubled from the beginning, as whole sectors of Coruscant started to [[Coruscant civil war|revolt]], and [[Fleet Admiral]] Gallius Rax refused to allow [[Grand Admiral]] [[Rae Sloane]] of the Imperial Navy to send reinforcements to Amedda, as the throneworld had no place in his vision of a renewed Empire. As Amedda's powers and influence faded, with Rax replacing him as ''de facto'' emperor and his control over most of Coruscant waning, he would, in his despair and desperation, seek to turn himself over to the [[New Republic]]. He saw himself as a prize of the highest priority, eventually making his way to a meeting with [[Chancellor (New Republic)|Chancellor]] Mon Mothma and [[Prince]]ss and Senator [[Leia Organa]] on [[Velusia]]. However, his plan would fail, as they refused to accept him as a prisoner and instead demanded he find a way to gain full control of the Galactic Empire to ensure a complete surrender.<ref name="Life Debt" />

After returning back to Coruscant, Amedda considered [[suicide]] by jumping off of one of the Imperial Palace's balconies. However, as he made his way back into his office, he realized that he had a visitor. Sloane was sitting in his office, and, initially, Amedda thought she had come to kill him. To his surprise, the Grand Admiral handed him a picture. It showed Palpatine, Amedda himself, Vice Admirals Screed and Rancit, Yularen and a young boy. Sloane was curious about the boy in the picture. When he attempted to reach for his [[blaster]], Sloane revealed that she had it. Remembering Mothma's words about him just being an administrator, Amedda decided that, to gain the Empire back in his grip, he would need to strike an alliance with Sloane. He confirmed Sloane's suspicions about the picture: the young boy was indeed Gallius Rax. Amedda then offered Sloane a way to find out who Rax was and where he came from. In return for the location of this crucial information, Amedda wanted to become a part of Sloane's Empire. After Sloane agreed, Amedda revealed the droids that contained the information Sloane sought were aboard the wreckage of the ''Imperalis'' on [[Quantxi]], the junk [[moon]] of [[Ord Mantell]].<ref name="Life Debt" />

====Captivity and surrender====
{{Quote|Get me clear, I can turn myself in. I'll give the Republic the codes to open the doors to the Imperial Palace. I'll tell them everything. I'll surrender the whole Empire. ''Please''.|Mas Amedda appealing to the Anklebiter Brigade for help.|Aftermath: Empire's End}}
During the final [[Standard month|months]] of the [[Galactic Civil War]], Amedda was confined to the Imperial Palace by [[soldier]]s loyal to Rax. Using intimidation tactics such as the threat of death or [[torture]], Rax forced Amedda to broadcast propaganda speeches praising the Counselor and urging the Empire to maintain the war effort. When a [[Anklebiter Brigade|group of children]] infiltrated the Palace, initially seeking to assassinate the Grand Vizier, Amedda promised to surrender the Empire and end the war if they facilitated his escape. The young [[Coruscanti]] agreed and with their assistance, Amedda went into hiding. He would later recount the experience, crediting the gaggle of [[Youngling|children]] who rescued him from captivity.<ref name="Empire's End" />

Following Rax's death at the [[Battle of Jakku]], Amedda reemerged and&mdash;with the military shattered into ineffective remnants&mdash;was free to represent the Empire at the signing of the [[Galactic Concordance]]. Unlike other Imperial officials who were convicted of war crimes, the Republic spared Amedda&mdash;who stepped down from the leadership of the Empire&mdash;and allowed him to resume his rule on Coruscant as the leader of a [[Coruscant provisional government|provisional government]]. However, Republic officials would oversee his administration to ensure that the Grand Vizier remained little more than a figurehead of a powerless government.<ref name="Empire's End" />

===Legacy===
Mas Amedda would be remembered as a willing, yet weak-willed participant in the establishment of the Galactic Empire. The media and [[Timeline of galactic history|history]] [[book]]s both portrayed him as a sycophant and lackey of Emperor Palpatine.<ref name="Empire's End" />

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Never again will we fear the Jedi! Through the grace of our Emperor Palpatine, we were saved from their ''treachery''. The Jedi are ''gone''. The Emperor saw through their ''plots''. Their ''lies''. He survived their attempt to ''assassinate'' him, and now, at last&hellip;we are ''safe''. ''Never again'' will their instruments of oppression terrorize the galaxy. We have entered a new age. An age of ''freedom''! Thus tyranny ends!|Mas Amedda celebrates the fall of the Jedi Order at a public rally|Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 1: The Chosen One, Part I}}
[[File:Chagrian AA.JPG|thumb|right|180px|Mas Amedda in the Galactic Senate.]]

Mas Amedda was a Chagrian [[Sexes|male]] who stood at 1.96 [[meter]]s.<ref name="DB" /> The [[color]] of both his skin and [[eye]]s were blue.<ref name="TPM" /> His booming voice often called for order when the partisan nature of the Republic's government degenerated into pointless bickering. In a gesture of authority, he would often punctuate such calls with a flicker of his long, forked tongue.<ref name="DB" />

For much of his political career in the Galactic Republic and Galactic Empire, Amedda was a political functionary who excelled in administration. Following the death of Emperor Palpatine at the Battle of Endor, Grand Vizier Amedda lacked the charisma and ideological fervor need to hold the fragmenting Galactic Empire together. Amedda's authority was also undercut by Fleet Admiral Gallius Rax, who assumed command of most of the Imperial remnants. With the New Republic, the successor to the Rebel Alliance, rapidly gaining ground, Amedda tried to surrender to the New Republic leadership in order to save himself. However, Chancellor Mothma rejected his offer since he lacked the authority to facilitate the Empire's surrender.<ref name="Life Debt" />

Amedda's lack of charisma and malleable nature allowed stronger Imperial players such as Grand Admiral Rae Sloane and Fleet Admiral Rax to manipulate and dominate him. Amedda once contemplated suicide when unable to extricate himself from the Empire's spiral into decline.<ref name="Life Debt" /> Towards the end of the Galactic Civil War, Amedda was forced by stormtroopers loyal to the-now [[Counselor to the Empire]] Rax to serve as his puppet and read Imperial [[propaganda]]. Disillusioned with the Empire, Amedda accepted help from a group of street children known as the [[Anklebiter Brigade]], who rescued him from captivity.<ref name="Empire's End" />

Recognizing that the Empire was lost, Amedda signed the Galactic Concordance with the New Republic leadership, formally ending the Civil War and the Empire. While Amedda was spared punishment due to his cooperation with the Republic, he was remembered as a weak-willed sycophant and lackey of the Emperor.<ref name="Empire's End" />

==Behind the scenes==
Mas Amedda was played by [[Jerome Blake]] in ''[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]'', [[David Bowers]] in ''[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'', and by both Blake and Bowers in ''[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]''. In ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'', he was voiced by [[Stephen Stanton]]. Amedda has also appeared in several [[Canon]] novels including [[James Luceno]]'s ''[[Tarkin (novel)|Tarkin]]'' and [[Chuck Wendig]]'s ''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]'' and ''[[Aftermath: Empire's End]]''.
