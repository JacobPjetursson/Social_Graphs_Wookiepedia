{{Quote|Let me give you some advice. Assume everyone will betray you and you will never be disappointed.|Tobias Beckett to Han Solo|Solo: A Star Wars Story}}
'''Tobias Beckett''' was a [[human]] [[sexes|male]] professional [[thief]] who worked for the [[Crimson Dawn]] crime syndicate during the [[Imperial Era|era]] of the [[Galactic Empire]]. A [[Homeworld|native]] of [[Glee Anselm]], Beckett organized a [[Beckett's gang|crew]] to help with his heist missions. Although he became a mentor to [[Han Solo]], a young [[Swamp trooper|mudtrooper]] who joined Beckett's group, Beckett was a survivor who quietly worked out angles that enabled him to come out ahead. He made use of many blasters, including the [[RSKF-44 heavy blaster]] and [[DG-29 heavy blaster pistol]]. He also owned a [[DL-44 heavy blaster pistol]] before [[Han's heavy blaster pistol|he gave it]] to Solo.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Tobias Beckett was [[Reproduction|born]] on the [[planet]] [[Glee Anselm]].<ref name="Official Guide" /> At some point before [[10 BBY]], Tobias Beckett met the [[bounty hunter]] [[Aurra Sing]] and pushed her to her [[death]]. Sing's death was later recalled to Beckett while talking with [[Lando Calrissian]], though Beckett claimed that he just gave Sing a push and that it was the fall that killed her.<ref name="Solo" />
===Hovun IV heist===
[[File:Becket Gang @ Hovun IV.jpg|thumb|left|252px|Beckett and his gang on Hovun IV]]
Beckett and his gang went to [[Hovun IV]] on a mission for [[Crimson Dawn]]. There, Beckett, posing as a [[Death priest]], pretended to [[Force choke]] [[Rio Durant]] in order to scare several [[sabacc]] players away from Durant's game. After players left, Beckett congratulated Durant on pulling off the trick. Beckett asked [[Val]] if she placed the tracker on [[Dvorad]], and she said she did. Beckett and his gang then went to the dock to find Dvorad in order to [[Heist on Hovun IV|steal]] [[Identichip]]s. Beckett was able to jump onto [[Dvorad's speeder]], punched him, and made it to [[Dvorad's ship]].<ref name="Beckett 1">''[[Star Wars: Beckett 1]]''</ref>

Beckett and his gang were held at gunpoint by Dvorad and his ship until a [[Unidentified creature (Hovun IV)|creature]] attacked. As his gang and Dvorad fought the creature, Beckett boarded the ship and fought his way past Dvorad's guards. Aboard, Beckett was able to find the the chips and make his way back to Val and Durant in order to make their escape before the creature pulled Dvorad's ship into the depths. As they left, Beckett shot down Durant's idea about keeping some of the chips for themselves instead of giving all of them to Crimson Dawn's leader, [[Dryden Vos]]. Beckett then summoned the [[Rampart (Tobias Beckett)|''Rampart'']] and left Hovun IV.<ref name="Beckett 1" />
[[File:Enfys and Beckett.jpg|thumb|238px|Beckett confronted by Nest and several of her Cloud-Riders]]
As the ''Rampart'' made its way to [[Munt Ontdal]], Beckett tried to think of a way to leave Crimson Dawn. After landing on Munt Ontdal, Beckett took his speeder to meet with Vos. However, he came under attack by several knife-wielding thieves. Beckett, seeing it as as a setup, tried to escape but was knocked out by [[Enfys Nest]], leader of the [[Cloud-Riders]]. Despite knowing Vos would arrive shortly, Beckett was told by Val that Nest faked the mission. Beckett, to prevent Nest from getting the chips, blew them and the ''Rampart'' up. Despite wanting to finish Nest off, Beckett was convinced to let them go for the day. Beckett and his gang were then confronted by several stormtroopers, but he lied to them by saying that the explosion was caused by black-market radioactive fuel. Beckett, Val, and Durant then decided to resume their death priest scheme.<ref name="Beckett 1" />
===Undercover on Mimban===
[[File:Swamptroopers Val & Beckett.jpeg|thumb|left|239px|Beckett with Val during the Mimban campaign]]
During the [[Mimban]] [[Mimban campaign|campaign]], Beckett was found with his [[Beckett's gang|crew]], disguised as a [[Captain]] of the [[Imperial Army]]. At some point during the battle, Beckett asked who was in charge, since their [[commanding officer]] had recently perished. [[Han Solo]], a [[Swamp trooper|mudtrooper]] with the [[224th Imperial Armored Division]], informed Beckett that he was in fact the ranking officer. Beckett then led his men through the battle. While observing a ship, he met the young Solo, who wanted to join them as part of their crew. A member of his crew, [[Rio Durant]], had doubts about letting Solo join them, but Beckett decided to give the boy an opportunity by leading him to be locked up for desertion. Solo was put in a chamber, where he was to be fed to the Wookiee [[Chewbacca]]. Solo ultimately was able to escape with Chewbacca, who initially intended to devour Solo. Beckett left with his crew, stealing the ship they observed earlier, but while in mid-takeoff they found Han and Chewbacca running towards them, waving for them to let them onto the ship. Beckett ordered Durant to lower the ship to let Solo and Chewbacca board.<ref name="Solo" />

===Heist on the Conveyex===
Tobias Beckett was a member of Crimson Dawn, a criminal organization led by [[Dryden Vos]]. Beckett was instructed to retrieve a crate of [[coaxium]] from a [[20-T Railcrawler conveyex transport]] on the planet [[Vandor]]; he went on this mission with his lover, [[Val]], and Durant. They were accompanied by Solo and Chewbacca.<ref name="Solo" />

Upon arriving at Vandor, the crew ate dinner over a campfire and had a brief conversation about Han and Chewbacca's motivation for participating in the mission. Solo simply stated that there was someone he left on Corellia three years ago and that he would return there to free her from her horrible life there. Val stated that everyone needed someone, even Beckett. Beckett began deconstructing one of his blasters and chucked it to Han. Han kept this blaster throughout the rest of his life as a smuggler and a rebel.<ref name="Solo" />

In the morning, Beckett, Val and Han observed the transport carrying the coaxium as well as some patrolling Viper droids, while discussing the plan for the heist. The conveyex was moving towards a bridge over a ravine. The plan was for Val to place explosives on the supports of the bridge. The other members of the crew (save Durant, the pilot) were to board the conveyex and attach cables from the carriage which contained the coaxium to their ship. Then, as the conveyex neared the bridge, Val was to destroy the bridge while the crew disconnected the coaxium carriage from the rest of the conveyex, allowing the ship to lift the target carriage away while the rest of the conveyex fell to the bottom of the ravine. Val noted that if the Viper droids were alerted, the heist would become much more difficult, prompting Han to also survey the Viper droids.<ref name="Solo" />

Soon the heist began. Val went further up the track to place thermal detonators, Durant flew their ship over the transport, and Beckett, Han and Chewbacca leaped aboard the transport. They opened up a hatch and gazed upon the coaxium inside, enough to power a whole star fleet. A fight ensued with some Imperial troopers aboard the transport, but Chewbacca disconnected the troopers' portion of the conveyex, leaving them behind as the rest of the conveyex moved onwards. The crew then connected four cables from their ship to the last carriage of the conveyex in order to lift it.<ref name="Solo" />

The heist did not proceed smoothly, however, as Val spotted the [[Cloud-Riders]], led by [[Enfys Nest]], moving towards the conveyex. One Cloud-Rider boarded the crew's ship and had a brief firefight with Durant, who was gravely injured, diminishing his ability to pilot the ship. Val was surrounded by a swarm of viper droids. She told Beckett over the comm how much she loved him, and detonated the explosives while still near them. Han took Durant's place as pilot and tried carrying the shipment with only one cable attached to the carriage. Enfys Nest and her Cloud-Riders had cut off the other three and replaced them with their own. Shortly after, Durant perished too.<ref name="Solo" />

Chewbacca uncoupled the carriage from the others so that they could lift the shipment off the tracks. Han and the Cloud-Riders had to eventually lift the shipment, for they were running out of track. Both tried to take the shipment with them but failed as they were both pulling opposite directions. As both Han and the Cloud-Riders neared a mountain, Han detached the shipment of coaxium, fearing a crash. The Cloud-Riders did so as well. The coaxium was lost. After they landed, Beckett made tombstones in remembrance of his fallen comrades.<ref name="Solo" />

[[File:Solo Beckett & Vos.jpeg|thumb|right|299px|Han and Beckett promising to retrieve unrefined coaxium from Kessel]]
He reported to Dryden Vos and was able to avoid execution by promising to retrieve unrefined coaxium from [[Kessel]]. Beckett had to make room for [[Qi'ra]] on his crew in accordance with Vos' wishes.<ref name="Solo" />

===Mission to Kessel===
{{Quote|This is a precision job. Thermal vault will be on the lowest level. Down where it's warm. The only way we're going to pull this off if everybody plays their part. Stick to the plan. Do not improvise...Alright people, time to shine.|Tobias Beckett to his crew|Solo: A Star Wars Story}}
Taken to Kessel by [[Lando Calrissian]] and [[L3-37]] on the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', Beckett, posing as a guard named [[Tuul]], successfully obtained the necessary amount of coaxium and travelled with his accomplices to [[Savareen]] so the unstable material could be refined and they could rendezvous with Dryden Vos. During the mission, Beckett posed as a guard for Qi'ra, directing the fake captives, Han and Chewie, out of the ''Falcon''. He later followed Qi'ra, L3, the [[Pyke]] who met them and its guards. While Qi'ra went into another room to negotiate with the Pyke, Beckett took out the guards outside, then watched Qi'ra fight the Pyke. After a moment of unnerving silence from the room, he opened the door, only to be astonished to see a Pyke laying on the floor with Qi'ra walking out of the room telling him that she was taught [[Teräs Käsi]] by Dryden Vos. Once they got to the consoles to help Han to get to the vault of coaxium, L3 had freed some slave droids, who also freed the other slaves in the mine. The slaves inevitably rebelled against the guards, allowing Beckett and the others to escape aboard the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name="Solo" />

===Refine on Savareen and Death===
[[File:Beckett and Chewie.png|thumb|left|220px|Beckett taking Chewbacca as prisoner]]
On Savareen, Beckett showed his true colors to Han, Qi'ra, and Chewbacca. After Han had told Beckett their plan, Beckett reported to Vos. When they met Vos, Vos surprised the team by announcing that the coaxium was fake, which he knew because of his "inside man," whom Han assumed to be Qi'ra but was indeed Beckett. He had informed Vos of Han's plan to sell the real shipment to the Cloud Riders, a rebellion group led by Enfys Nest. Han announced that he anticipated Beckett's deception&mdash;the
coaxium they were holding was real.[[File:Toby gonna die.png|thumb|right|245x245px|Beckett dies in Han Solo arms.]]

Beckett betrayed the three and abandoned Dryden. He attempted to take the coaxium for himself, but as he explained his motives, he was shot by Han. Before passing away, Beckett praised Han for his actions in addition to revealing that he actually planned to return to Glee Anselm and learn to play the [[Valachord]].<ref name="Solo" />
===Legacy===
{{Quote|Heard about a job. Big shot gangster, putting together a crew.|Tobias Beckett|Solo: A Star Wars Story}}
Immediately after Han left the ''First Light'', as he killed Beckett, Qi'ra reported Vos' death to [[Maul]], the [[Zabrak]] former [[Sith Lord]] who lead Crimson Dawn behind the shadows, and gave Beckett the blame for Dryden's death, oblivious that Beckett had been killed by the man she loved. Enraged, before ordering her to go to [[Dathomir]] so they could work more closely, Maul promised that he would think what to do with the traitorous Beckett, unaware that Beckett was no longer alive.<ref name="Solo" />

Even though Beckett was killed, Han recalled to Chewbacca that Beckett said that he heard about some big-shot [[gangster]] putting together a job as they headed to Tatooine.<ref name="Solo" />

==Behind the scenes==
{{Quote|I play a guy named Beckett, who's kind of a criminal and a mentor to Han.|Woody Harrelson, on Tobias Beckett|url=http://www.nbc.com/the-tonight-show/video/woody-harrelson-joined-star-wars-as-a-criminal-and-got-arrested/3489591}}
Tobias Beckett appears in ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' and is portrayed by [[Woody Harrelson]]. Early fan speculation believed that Harrelson would be playing [[Garris Shrike]]&mdash;Han Solo's mentor in the [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] continuity who first appeared in [[A. C. Crispin]]'s ''[[The Han Solo Trilogy]]'' book series&mdash;but this theory was proven incorrect when Harrelson revealed Beckett's name on ''[[Wikipedia:The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon|The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]''.<ref name="CB">{{Cite_web|url=http://comicbook.com/starwars/2017/03/23/star-wars-who-is-woody-harrelson-playing-in-han-solo/|title=Star Wars: Woody Harrelson Reveals Who He's Playing In Han Solo Movie|accessdate=2017-03-23|author=Ridgely, Charlie|date=2017-03-23|publisher=ComicBook.com}}</ref>

According to screenwriters [[Lawrence Kasdan]] and [[Jon Kasdan]], Beckett is based on [[Wikipedia:Long John Silver|Long John Silver]], the main antagonist of [[Wikipedia:Robert Louis Stevenson|Robert Louis Stevenson's]] [[1800s#1883|1883]] novel ''[[Wikipedia:Treasure Island|Treasure Island]]''.<ref name="Solo Rogues Gallery">{{Cite web|url=http://ew.com/movies/2018/02/09/solo-a-star-wars-story-woody-harrelson-thandie-newton-paul-bettany/|title=Star Wars: Woody Harrelson, Thandie Newton, Paul Bettany character details|last=Breznican|first=Anthony|date=2018-02-09|work=[[Wikipedia:Entertainment Weekly|Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> Beckett's later betrayal was meant to rhyme the moment of [[1977]] [[original trilogy]] film [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']] in which Han Solo returns during the [[Battle of Yavin]] to aide Luke Skywalker on destroying the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]], as in both movies, the cynical and older character reluctantly departs and then suddenly returns, though in Beckett's case, it was for betrayal rather than for heroic nature.<ref name="Jon's Twitter">{{Twitter|JonKasdan|status/1040529511513616385|[[Jon Kasdan]]|quote=continued}}</ref> Throughout the production of ''Solo'', Beckett's first name was Mattias<ref name="Art of Solo">''[[The Art of Solo: A Star Wars Story]]''</ref> but was changed to Tobias late in production, though it has been corrected in recent printings of ''[[The Art of Solo: A Star Wars Story]]''.<ref name="Phil's Twitter">{{Twitter|PhilSzostak|status/1049778868188409858|[[Phil Szostak]]|quote=Yes, as was Lady Proxima from Mother Proxima.

Beckett's death was written as a reference to the infamous "[[Han shot first]]" controversy, which debates whether Han Solo or [[Greedo]] shoot first in the [[Special Edition]] of ''A New Hope''. In ''Solo'', Han shoots Beckett mid-sentence. Kasdan Sr., who wrote the script of the movie with his son Jon Kasdan, said about it that "There can be no question that Han shoots first." Furthermore, Kasdan Sr. thinks that Han indeed shot first as he expressed during an interview with [[StarWars.com]].<ref name="What Kasdan Thinks">{{SW|url=news/solo-lawrence-and-jonathan-kasdan-interview|text=A Portrait of the Scoundrel as a Young Man: Writers Lawrence and Jonathan Kasdan on ''Solo: A Star Wars Story''}}</ref>
