==Behind the scenes==
Coleman Trebor was a completely computer-generated character in [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]. For scenes in the [[Jedi Council Chamber]], stock footage from [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']] was reused, with Trebor digitally painted over [[Yarael Poof]], who was replaced as [[George Lucas]] felt the audience would confuse him with the newly-introduced [[Kaminoan]]s. Coleman Trebor's name was derived from that of [[Rob Coleman]] of [[Industrial Light & Magic]]. Coleman recalls that the character's name was suggested by Visual Effects Supervisor [[John Knoll]].<ref>{{HBCite|67|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20050305030907/http://www.starwars.com/site/homingbeacon/67.html}}</ref>
