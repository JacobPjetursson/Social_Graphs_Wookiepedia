{{Quote|Soon enough, you will stop denying the truth of so very many things. And you will understand that I am not a traitor, but a visionary! Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hatred leads to suffering. But what the Jedi failed to teach you, what I have learned, is how to persevere, to pass ''through'' suffering, and achieve ultimate power!|Dooku, to Quinlan Vos|Dark Disciple}}
'''Dooku''', a [[Force-sensitive]] [[human]] [[Sexes|male]], was a [[Sith Lord]] who led the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] as [[Head of State]] during the [[Clone Wars]]. Although he was once a [[Jedi Master]], Dooku left the [[Jedi Order]] and the [[Galactic Republic]] after growing disillusioned with the corruption in the government. Turning from the [[Light side of the Force|light]] he once served as a [[Jedi]], Dooku joined the [[dark side of the Force]] and became the [[Sith apprentice|apprentice]] of [[Darth Sidious]], the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]], taking on the name '''Darth Tyranus''' and reclaiming his title as the [[Count of Serenno|Count of]] [[Serenno]]. With his [[Sith Master|master]], who was secretly [[Supreme Chancellor]] Sheev Palpatine, Dooku conspired to overthrow both the Republic and the Jedi so that the [[Sith]] could reclaim their former dominance. To this end, he oversaw a growing [[Separatist Crisis|secessionist movement]] that ultimately resulted in the formation of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. In addition to rallying rebellious [[star system]]s to the Separatist cause, Dooku was involved in the creation of the [[clone trooper]]s of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]], having supplied the [[Kaminoan]]s with the [[clone template]], [[Jango Fett]], as well as the [[Control chip|inhibitor chip]] containing [[Order 66|Clone Protocol 66]]. As a result of Dooku and Sidious's machinations, [[the galaxy]] became engulfed by the Clone Wars [[22 BBY|twenty-two years]] before the [[Battle of Yavin]].

[[Count]] Dooku led the Confederacy's [[Separatist Droid Army|battle droid army]] throughout the war, turning [[star]] systems against the Republic through [[Politics|political]] maneuverings and [[Confederacy military|military]] force. Though he was bound by the Sith [[Rule of Two]], Dooku trained apprentices of his own, with the intention of one [[Standard day|day]] succeeding his master. He first trained [[Asajj Ventress]]; later, after Sidious ordered him to dispose of Ventress, Dooku took on a second apprentice, [[Savage Opress]]. The tutelage was short-lived, as Opress had been used by Ventress as a tool of revenge against her former master. Toward the end of the war, Dooku took on a third apprentice, the fallen Jedi [[Quinlan Vos]], with whom he plotted to overthrow his master. This apprenticeship, too, was cut short, as Vos was redeemed in [[the Force]] with the help of Asajj Ventress.

The final days of the war saw a [[Battle of Coruscant|battle]] over [[Coruscant]]. In a [[Lightsaber duel|duel]] aboard the Separatist [[flagship]] ''[[Invisible Hand]]'', Dooku was defeated by [[Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker]], who [[Death|beheaded]] the helpless Dooku at Palpatine's command. Dooku was soon replaced as Palpatine's apprentice by Skywalker himself, who fell to the dark side and became [[Darth]] Vader. Despite Dooku's death, the plans he helped set into motion during the [[Cloning|Clone]] Wars came to pass, with the [[Jedi Purge|destruction]] of the Jedi Order and the [[Proclamation of the New Order|rise]] of the [[Galactic Empire]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Quote|Fought well you have, my old Padawan.|Yoda|Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones}}
[[File:TPM-CGYoda.JPG|thumb|left|200x200px|Dooku had once been Padawan to Grand Master Yoda.]]
Early in his life, Dooku was taken in by the [[Jedi Order]] and became [[Yoda]]'s [[Padawan]] in the era of the [[Galactic Republic]].<ref name="Episode II" /> In doing so, Dooku relinquished a family fortune that would have, by simple virtue of its size, guaranteed him a place amongst the galaxy's most powerful and influential beings.<ref name="Tarkin">''[[Tarkin (novel)|Tarkin]]''</ref> During a mission to [[Kashyyyk]], Dooku watched as his master faced a dreadful giant [[Terentatek]].<ref name="Destiny" /> He eventually attained the rank of Jedi Master, and took [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] as his apprentice.<ref name="Episode II" /><ref name="Ultimate">''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''</ref> He also rendered help to [[Mother (title)|Mother]] [[Talzin]] of the [[Nightsisters]],<ref name="Monster">{{TCW|Monster}}</ref> giving her a lock of his hair.<ref name="Massacre" /> Qui-Gon Jinn became a [[Jedi Knight]] and later became a Jedi Master himself. Jinn had at least some contact with his old Master and after taking [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] as his apprentice, spoke highly of his Padawan to Dooku, although Dooku never met the young Kenobi as a Jedi.<ref name="Episode II" />

Even before the [[Battle of Naboo|death of his former apprentice]] on Naboo, Dooku had become disillusioned with Jedi Order, the Republic, and the Galactic Senate's corruption. He left the Order, becoming one of the [[Lost Twenty]].<ref name="SW:AEYNtK" /> He returned to his ancestral home and reclaimed his family title of [[Count]] of [[Serenno]]. With his reclaimed title, he also took possession of a family fortune so vast that it placed him amongst the wealthiest and most influential beings in the galaxy. Despite his newfound wealth and power however, Dooku all but disappeared from public life after his resignation. Most believed that he had gone into a sort of self imposed exile with the intention of founding an offshoot of the Jedi Order.<ref name="Tarkin" /> However, at some point during this period Dooku was approached by [[Darth Sidious]]. The Dark Lord offered Dooku the opportunity to become his apprentice and with that offer, the chance to destroy the Jedi Order and reshape the Republic. Desiring both power and the elimination of the corruption that plagued the Republic, Dooku agreed and was given the name Darth Tyranus.<ref name="Episode II" />

For nearly a decade after accepting Sidious's offer, Dooku helped his new master to implement much of the groundwork necessary to begin the Clone Wars. The most important project that he oversaw during that time was the creation of a [[Grand Army of the Republic|clone army]] intended for use by the Republic during the planned war. Hoping to give the project a strong layer of legitimacy and to hide his own involvement, he suggested to Jedi Master [[Sifo-Dyas]] the idea of creating the army for the Republic, which could be held in reserve in case of civil war. Sifo-Dyas, who was greatly troubled by the Republic's tumultuous political situation and the Jedi Council's apparent complacency, agreed to order the army from the [[Kaminoan]]s. After this was done, Dooku needed to make certain that Sifo-Dyas would remain silent about the army so as not to alert the Jedi Council. As such, he contacted [[Lom Pyke]] of the [[Pyke Syndicate]] and instructed him to murder Sifo-Dyas by way of shooting down his shuttle during a mission, after which Dooku was given Sifo-Dyas's body. However, unbeknownst to Dooku, the Pykes captured Valorum's aide, [[Silman]], and imprisoned him as insurance against possible betrayal by Dooku.<ref name="The Lost 1">{{TCW|The Lost One}}</ref>

On one of the [[moon]]s of [[Bogden]], Dooku recruited the bounty hunter [[Jango Fett]] as the template for the Clone Army. Along with a considerable salary, Dooku agreed to pay Fett with an [[Boba Fett|unaltered clone]] for himself.<ref name="Episode II" /> In order to ensure the elimination of the Jedi when the time was right, Dooku and Sidious had the clones outfitted with [[Control chip|bio-chips]] in their brains which could be used to trigger a [[Order 66|protocol]] that would cause the clones to murder their Jedi superiors.<ref name="The Unknown">{{TCW|The Unknown}}</ref> During this time, Count Dooku recruited fallen [[Dathomirian]] Jedi [[Asajj Ventress]] to act as his [[assassin]] and his Sith apprentice.<ref name="Nightsisters">{{TCW|Nightsisters (episode)|Nightsisters}}</ref>

[[File:Count Dooku and the Separatist Council members Nute Gunray Poggle the Lesser Wat Tambor and San Hill.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Dooku with the Separatist leaders.]]
Eight years after his resignation from the Jedi Order, Dooku reentered the public eye in a spectacular fashion, commandeering a Republic Holonet station in the Raxus system and delivering a rousing speech in which he thoroughly lambasted the corruption and shortcomings of the Republic. In a galaxy in which many Outer and Mid Rim systems were chafing under the ineffectual and corrupt bureaucracy of the Republic, Dooku's speech set the stage for the Separatist movement. He began meddling in the affairs of many planets, supporting anti-Republic coups on worlds such as [[Ryloth]] and interfering in the political processes of Kashyyyk and [[Onderon]], among others. He also began to publicly rally systems and corporations to his cause to become the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]], and publicly spurned every opportunity to negotiate with Palpatine. During the time leading up to the Clone Wars, Dooku also met several times with the governor of that time, [[Wilhuff Tarkin]] of [[Eriadu]], in an attempt to convince him to join the Separatist movement. He alluded to the governor that war was inevitable, and that he desired the support of the powerful Outer Rim world for his cause. These meetings had been orchestrated by Palpatine to test Tarkin's loyalties, and Tarkin remained firm in this commitment to the Republic.<ref name="Tarkin" /> Dooku also promised Trade Federation Viceroy Gunray that he would assassinate Senator Amidala, whom Gunray despised, if he signed Dooku's treaty. Gunray accepted the offer; Dooku thus dispatched Jango Fett to carry out Amidala's assassination. Despite the failure of Fett's mission, Dooku was able to have the Trade Federation, the Banking Clan, the Techno Union, the Commerce Guild and the Corporate Alliance all sign his treaty on Geonosis. Dooku assured them that the Jedi and the Republic would be overwhelmed by their combined forces.<ref name="Episode II" /> 

===The Clone Wars===
====Battle of Geonosis====
{{Quote|Powerful you have become, Dooku. The dark side I sense in you.''"<br />"''I've become more powerful than any Jedi. Even you.|Yoda and Dooku|Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones}}
[[File:Geonosis-jango-cg-with-dooku.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Dooku watches the Battle of Geonosis unfold with his right-hand man Jango Fett.]]
Dooku captured Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi and had him imprisoned. Dooku then questioned Kenobi, denying that the bounty hunter whom Kenobi was looking for was on [[Geonosis]] and promising that he would petition Obi-Wan's release. Dooku told Kenobi how he wished that his former apprentice, Qui-Gon Jinn, was still alive and how he could have used his help. Kenobi replied that his master would have never joined Dooku's movement. Dooku claimed that Qui-Gon knew about the Republic's corruption but would not do anything until he knew the truth. Dooku told Kenobi that the Republic was under the control of the Sith Lord, Darth Sidious. He tried to convince Kenobi to join him, but the Jedi refused.<ref name="Episode II" />

The count sentenced Kenobi, Skywalker, and Amidala to death in the [[Petranaki arena]]. As Dooku, Fett, Boba and the other Separatist leaders watched the execution, Master Windu and [[Jedi assault team|200 other Jedi]] came to rescue the trio. Upon Mace Windu's arrival, Jango Fett was held at lightsaber point by Windu, but the Jedi was forced back by [[B2 super battle droid|super battle droids]] and Fett. Dooku and the others watched as their battle droids surrounded the remaining Jedi. Dooku offered to spare their lives if they surrendered, but Windu and the others refused. In a regretful tone, Dooku gave the order to terminate them. Fortunately for the Jedi survivors, at that moment Yoda arrived with the clone army from Kamino and rescued the Jedi.<ref name="Episode II" />

Dooku oversaw the [[Battle of Geonosis|battle]], continually assuring his allies that his master would not let the Republic get away with the rescue. As the Clone Army fought the Separatists' droid army, Dooku and the other leaders planned their retreat. Before leaving, Dooku was given the [[Death Star plans|designs]] to the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|ultimate weapon]] by Archduke [[Poggle the Lesser]]. Dooku assured him that the designs would be safe with his master, Sidious. Dooku then took [[Flitknot Speeder Bike|his speeder]] and was escorted by two [[Nantex-class territorial defense starfighter|Geonosian fighters]], although he was pursued by Kenobi and Skywalker's [[Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry|gunship]].<ref name="Episode II" />

[[File:Dooku_vs_yoda.jpg|thumb|right|250px|After defeating Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, Dooku duels his former master, Yoda.]]
As Dooku prepared to leave, he was confronted by Kenobi and Skywalker. At first, Dooku was able to subdue Skywalker with [[Force lightning]], and fought Kenobi, eventually overpowering and wounding him in the shoulder and leg. Then, as Dooku prepared to make his killing move, he was stopped by Skywalker. The two fought until Dooku cut off Skywalker's right arm. Dooku was confronted by his former master, Yoda, whom the Sith Lord proved to be at a disadvantage against. With Republic reinforcements incoming, Dooku was able to escape by causing a pillar to fall on Kenobi and Skywalker, distracting Yoda. Dooku used his [[Count Dooku's Punworcca 116-class interstellar sloop|solar sailer]] to escape along with his forces.<ref name="Episode II" />

[[File:Sith lair The Works.png|thumb|left|250px|Darth Tyranus meets his master.]]
Dooku then went to Coruscant, where he met his master, who was very impressed, in [[The Works]]. He informed Sidious that the War had begun, as he had planned.<ref name="Episode II" /> Dooku and his master recruited the cyborg General, [[Grievous]] to lead the droid army. Grievous was trained by Dooku in the Jedi Arts, using lightsabers taken from his Jedi kills as well. Later, Dooku commanded his droid army to seize control of the major hyperspace lanes following Geonosis, separating the Republic from the majority of its army.<ref name="TCWFilm">[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' film]]</ref> Dooku then sent Ventress to assist in the General [[Whorm Loathsom]]'s Droid Army in distracting Kenobi's and Skywalker's forces during the [[Battle of Christophsis|battle on]] [[Christophsis]]<ref name="The Hidden Enemy">{{TCW|The Hidden Enemy}}</ref> before completing her other mission.<ref name="TCWFilm" />

====Dealings with the Hutts====
{{Quote|Soon, the Jedi will not only be at war with you, Count, but with the Hutt clan as well.|Darth Sidious to Dooku & Asajj Ventress|Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)}}
Dooku made a deal with [[Ziro Desilijic Tiure|Ziro]], uncle of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba the Hutt]], that he would kidnap Jabba's son, [[Rotta]] and that the Jedi would be blamed. He would then be left to take leadership of the [[Hutt Clan]]s. Dooku sent Ventress in her assault ship, the ''[[Trident (starship)/Legends|Trident]]'', to Tatooine to carry out the kidnapping. She took him to the [[B'omarr Order Monastery|abandoned monastery]] on [[Teth]] with two battalions of battle droids. She was contacted by Dooku and then by Lord Sidious, who assured them that Jedi would be at war with Hutts as well as them. After Kenobi finished his negotiations, Dooku went to Tatooine and spoke with Jabba, claiming that the Jedi were behind his son's kidnapping. Dooku had Ventress and her spy droid, [[4-A7]] provide 'evidence' that Skywalker and his apprentice were the ones who carried out the kidnapping. Dooku showed this to Jabba, convincing him of the Jedi's treachery. Dooku told him how his droid army was mounting a rescue. Dooku asked Jabba if he would consider joining the Separatist in their struggle against the Republic. Dooku was informed by Ventress that Skywalker was eluding her and escaping with Jabba's son.<ref name="TCWFilm" />

[[File:Anakin vs Dooku TCW01.png|thumb|right|350px|Dooku dueling Skywalker in the Dune Sea.]]
After her defeat, Dooku had Ventress lie that Skywalker had killed his infant. Jabba, believing Dooku, allowed him to send him and battle droids to deal with Skywalker personally. After his [[IG-100 MagnaGuard|MagnaGuards]] shot Skywalker down, Dooku went into the [[Dune Sea]]. He contacted Ziro, informing him that Jabba believes his story and assured him that he would be master of the Hutt clans. Dooku also had Ziro take Senator Amidala prisoner when she learned of Ziro's deal with him. Dooku confronted Skywalker to kill Rotta. The two of them dueled, until Dooku realize the Hutt was with his apprentice. However, he anticipated this and had Magnaguards wait for her. Dooku then taunted Skywalker with his hologram of his apprentice's fight. Dooku knocked them down, telling him that his droid will kill his apprentice and the Hutt, and then bring her before Jabba, where he would execute her for Rotta's murder. He laughed as Skywalker went to rescue his apprentice. After Jabba learned of the truth of his uncle's deal, Dooku left Tatooine. He informed Lord Sidious of his failure, saying their fight has become more difficult. Sidious told him to allow the Jedi their victory, knowing that the engines have turned in their favor.<ref name="TCWFilm" />

====Negotiations with the Toydarians====
{{Quote|I sense you are one who respects strength, your highness. Our droid armies outnumber the Republic clones 100 to 1.''"<br />"''Perhaps, but I have heard that a single Jedi equals 100 battle droids.|Dooku negotiating with King Katuunko.|Ambush}}
During the initial start of Separatist [[Battle of Ryloth|occupation of]] Ryloth, Dooku was informed by [[TX-20]] that the Jedi were sending Senator [[Bail Organa]] of [[Alderaan]] to [[Toydaria]] to establish supply lines to the Republic garrison and [[Twi'lek]] people. Dooku contacted Senator [[Lott Dod]] of the Trade Federation to prevent the Republic from doing so.<ref name="Supply Lines">{{TCW|Supply Lines}}</ref>

Dooku learned that King [[Katuunko]] was considering joining the Republic and was going to speak with his former master Yoda on the neutral moon, [[Rugosa]]. He sent his apprentice, Ventress to convince him to join the Separatists. Ventress was able to make a deal with Katuunko and Yoda; If Yoda and his 3 troopers defeated her droid battalion, he may join the Republic, but if her droids capture Yoda, join the Separatists. Dooku approved of her deal, knowing that Yoda made a mistake in venturing far from Coruscant. However, Yoda was able to defeat her droids. Katuunko then told Dooku that he would be joining the Republic, seeing Ventress's treachery. Dooku urged him to reconsider to no avail. Dooku then ordered Ventress to kill him. However, Yoda stopped her before she could carry it out. Dooku watched as Ventress made her escape, saying that he was fortunate he was not there personally with his old master.<ref name="Ambush">{{TCW|Ambush}}</ref>

====The ''Malevolence''====
{{Quote|In this war, a step ahead of us Dooku always seems.|[[Yoda]]|Rising Malevolence}}
[[File:Rising Malevolence.png|thumb|left|350px|Dooku and Grievous on the bridge of the Malevolence.]]
Dooku was then on-board General Grievous's heavy cruiser, the ''[[Malevolence]]'', in the [[Abregado system]]. When a fleet of Republic cruisers entered the system, Dooku ordered Grievous to jam their communications. Dooku then ordered them to use the cruiser's secret weapon, the [[Ion cannon]], on the Republic fleet. After the Republic fleet was disabled and destroyed, Dooku then sent out hunters to make sure there were no survivors. Dooku learned that a group of survivors had destroyed the pod hunters. As Dooku, Grievous and the ''Malevolence'' searched for the survivors, Skywalker arrived and found them before they did. However, they were able to detect a non-battle droid signal. Dooku ordered Grievous to destroy the ship, but failed. Despite this being unfortunate, Dooku then contacted Lord Sidious.<ref name="Rising ''Malevolence''">{{TCW|Rising Malevolence|Rising ''Malevolence''}}</ref>

After Grievous attacked a medical convoy near the [[Ryndellia system]], Dooku gave Grievous his next target; the [[Kaliida Shoals Medical Center|Republic's Outer Rim Medical Center]]. En route to the target, Dooku informed Grievous that the Republic had launched a strike team under Skywalker to attack the ''Malevolence''. Dooku warned Grievous to not underestimate Skywalker.<ref name="Shadow of ''Malevolence''">{{TCW|Shadow of Malevolence|Shadow of ''Malevolence''}}</ref> After the ''Malevolence''{{'}}s hyperdrive was disabled, Dooku arranged for Amidala to be captured while en route to negotiations with the [[InterGalactic Banking Clan|Banking Clan]]. As Grievous made his escape, Dooku contacted him, awaiting his and the ''Malevolence''<nowiki/>'s arrival. However, Dooku's communications was cut by Grievous, due to his failure in bringing the ''Malevolence'' to the rendezvous point.<ref name="Destroy ''Malevolence''">{{TCW|Destroy Malevolence|Destroy ''Malevolence''}}</ref>

====Gunray's rescue====
{{Quote|There is no margin for error this time, child. You must prove yourself worthy of being my apprentice.''"<br />"''I ''am'' worthy, as you shall see.|Dooku speaks with Ventress, his would-be-Sith apprentice|Cloak of Darkness}}
[[File:Sidious Dooku Talk 2.png|thumb|right|250x250px|Dooku speaking with Sidious about Gunray]]
When Viceroy Gunray was captured, Dooku was then contacted by Sidious informing of the danger's of Gunray's interrogation by the Jedi. Dooku informed him that he already had a plan in motion; to send Asajj Ventress to either free Gunray or silence him. Sidious however, questioned Ventress's competence due to previous failures. Dooku assured Sidious that she would complete the mission. After his conversation, Dooku told Ventress that she must prove herself worthy of being his apprentice, and Ventress assured him that she would. Dooku also bribed Senate commando, [[Argyus]] into helping Ventress free Gunray. Ventress ultimately succeeded in her mission to rescue Gunray, terminating Argyus for downplaying her role in the rescue.<ref name="Cloak of Darkness" />

====Testing Grievous====
{{Quote|General, the ongoing stalemate in the war has become unacceptable. There is concern you have lost your focus. Lord Sidious demands more dramatic results: more dead Jedi.''"<br />"''You expect victory over Jedi, but all you give me to fight them is battle droids. Bah!|Dooku (via hologram), speaking with Grievous|Lair of Grievous}}
[[File:Dooku deception.png|thumb|left|220x220px|Dooku directs the Jedi toward an "alternative prize."]]
After Gunray's escape,<ref name="Cloak of Darkness" /> Dooku, frustrated with the ongoing stalemate, arranged a test for General Grievous. He laid a trap for Jedi Master [[Kit Fisto]], his former apprentice, [[Nahdar Vebb]] and their clone troopers at [[Grievous's fortress]] in the [[Vassek system]]. He then deactivated Grievous's MagnaGuards. After the Jedi found Gunray's hologram and the tracking device, Dooku contacted Fisto, offering an alternative prize. Dooku then contacted General Grievous, informing him of Lord Sidious's demand for more dramatic examples; more dead Jedi. Grievous told Dooku that all he has are battle droids. After Grievous's first confrontation with the Jedi and the death of his pet [[roggwart]], [[Gor]], Dooku contacted him telling him that he arranged for this test. Grievous then cut communications with Dooku to finish off the Jedi. Dooku then contacted him on his victory. However, Grievous told him that Fisto escaped him. Dooku told him that there was room for improvement.<ref name="Lair of Grievous">{{TCW|Lair of Grievous}}</ref>

====Dooku's capture====
{{Quote|I still don't get it.''"<br />"''Get what?''"<br />"''How a bunch of drunken pirates managed to catch Dooku when we couldn't.|Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi|Dooku Captured}}
Dooku captured Skywalker and took him aboard his command ship. Skywalker was rescued by Kenobi and the two of them confronted Dooku. Dooku made his escape to his solar sailer as the Republic forces arrived. Dooku was soon thereafter shot down by Skywalker and Kenobi, and crash landed on [[Vanqor]] where he hid in a cave. He next caused a cave-in, forcing Skywalker to lose his lightsaber which Dooku took, and then sealed the cave off. Dooku found [[Weequay]] [[Ohnaka Gang|pirates]] at his solar sailer. Thereafter, Dooku approached the pirate's captain, [[Hondo Ohnaka]], who offered him passage to [[Florrum]] for a price. Dooku agreed to pay him while secretly planning to kill all the pirates upon their arrival on Florrum. However before he could, Dooku's lightsabers were stolen from him by Hondo's [[Kowakian monkey-lizard|monkey-lizard]] [[Pilf Mukmuk]]. Dooku warned them that they were not dealing with a Jedi, but a Sith Lord. However, he was outnumbered and ransomed off to the Republic by the pirates. Kenobi and Skywalker checked to ensure the pirates had actually captured him. Dooku warned the Jedi that the pirates were devious and that they would not allow them leave.<ref name="Dooku Captured">{{TCW|Dooku Captured}}</ref>

Dooku was proven correct when he, Kenobi and Skywalker were tied together. Thus, Dooku was forced to work with the Jedi to escape before the Republic arrived. During their 2nd escape attempt, Dooku was saved by Kenobi before the were captured by Hondo and his men. However, after Republic representative [[Jar Jar Binks|Binks]] and his escort disabled the power, Dooku made his escape by choking a guard. He then killed [[Turk Falso]] and forced him to kill another Weequay with his own gun. At that point he stole their shuttle and made his escape.<ref name="The Gungan General">{{TCW|The Gungan General}}</ref>

====The Defoliator test====
[[File:LokDurddude2.jpg|thumb|220x220px|Lok Durd speaks with Count Dooku during the defoliator's first test]]
Dooku observed General [[Lok Durd]]'s test of their new weapon, the [[Defoliator]] [[Defoliator Deployment Tank|Deployment Tank]] on [[Maridun]]. After the initial success of the weapon's effects on the battle droids, Dooku asked to him to test the weapon on living targets. Durd assured that he would on the [[Lurmen]] colonists.<ref name="Defenders of Peace">{{TCW|Defenders of Peace}}</ref>

====Occupation of Ryloth====
During the initial start of the Republic's return to Ryloth, Dooku assured Tambor that the Republic forces were spread thin in its sector and that it would be suicide for the Republic.<ref name="Storm Over Ryloth">{{TCW|Storm Over Ryloth}}</ref> After the Republic landed and were moving on the capital of [[Lessu]], Dooku was informed by [[TA-175]] of Tambor's pitiful job in protecting the Separatist's investment on Ryloth. Though Tambor claimed that the tactical droid was exaggerating, Dooku warned him that he was no match for Windu. Dooku then ordered Tambor to evacuate with what valuables he had and to destroy what was left. Dooku told Tambor that the charred ruins of Ryloth would demonstrate to the galaxy the cost of a Republic "victory". Dooku then contacted Tambor again, shocked that he had not left yet. Dooku then ordered him out before Windu and the Republic arrive. He then gave TA-175 orders to bomb the capital after they leave. After the Republic arrived and captured Tambor, Dooku ordered TA-175 to bomb the capital.<ref name="Liberty on Ryloth">{{TCW|Liberty on Ryloth}}</ref>

Dooku secretly supported the [[Death Watch]] movement on [[Mandalore]]. Dooku spoke with its leader, Governor [[Pre Vizsla]] of [[Concordia]], about the [[Jedi High Council|Jedi Council's]] investigation on Mandalore.

[[File:Saam card dodd & holo-dooku.jpeg|250px|thumb|right|Dooku assuring Saam, Card, & Dod their plan would work.]]
Dooku endorsed a [[Confederate–Republic peace initiative|peace initiative]] being offered by the [[Separatist Senate]]. However, Dooku had General Grievous carry out a [[Bombing of Coruscant's central power distribution grid|mission]] to ensure that Lord Sidious's plans continue unhindered. Dooku assured Republic senators Lott Dod, [[Gume Saam]], and [[Nix Card]] that they would ensure that the banks would be deregulated and they would receive their profits.<ref name="Heroes on Both Sides">{{TCW|Heroes on Both Sides}}</ref>

Dooku then attempted to coerce [[Pantora]], a moon of [[Orto Plutonia]] to join the Separatists by sending the Trade Federation to [[Blockade of Pantora|blockade]] the planet.<ref name="Sphere of Influence" />

After the attack, Dooku sent a message saying that the Republic had killed the very sponsor of the peace initiative, [[Mina Bonteri]]. In truth, Dooku had sent his agents to kill Bonteri.

====Ventress' "demise"====
{{Quote|I would hate to think you are training your own Sith apprentice to destroy me…"''<br />''"Never! My allegiance is to you and you alone."''<br />''"Then you must prove it. Eliminate her. |Darth Sidious ordering Dooku to terminate Ventress.|Nightsisters}}
[[File:VentressDooku-COD.png|thumb|left|250px|Darth Tyranus and Asajj Ventress.]]
Tyranus was then contacted by Lord Sidious about his assassin, Ventress, and how she was becoming powerful. Sidious believed that Dooku was training his own apprentice and was planning to replace him. Dooku assured Sidious that his loyalty was to him alone. To prove his loyalty, the Count was ordered to eliminate Ventress. Dooku tried to convince Sidious not to do this, but he complied. Dooku then contacted Ventress at [[Sullust]], informing her that he recalled her reinforcements. Ventress implored Dooku to help destroy the Jedi, but he told her that she was no longer his apprentice and that she would soon die. Dooku then contacted the tactical droid, [[TJ-912]], aboard its [[TJ-912's Recusant-class light destroyer|Destroyer]] and ordered it to destroy Ventress aboard the flagship. TJ-912 carried out Dooku's orders and informed him that she was dead. Dooku ordered TJ-912 to withdraw from Sullust. Dooku then informed Lord Sidious that Ventress had been destroyed, proving his loyalty to his master.<ref name="Nightsisters" />

Dooku then came under attack by Ventress and her fellow nightsisters posing as Jedi at his [[Dooku's palace|palace]] on Serenno. Though his senses were dulled by their poison, Dooku was able to fight them off with his Sith lightning. The attempt on his life failed but Dooku never found out the identity of his attackers. Dooku was then contacted by Mother Talzin, who was aware of the loss of his prized assassin, who was of one of her Nightsisters. She then offered Dooku one male from her planet to replace her. Dooku took her up on her offer.<ref name="Nightsisters" />

====Dealings with the Nightsisters====
{{Quote|We could certainly use the power of the Nightsisters against the Jedi.|Dooku to Mother Talzin|Monster}}
Dooku then traveled to Dathomir to speak with Talzin. Dooku proposed an alliance between his Separatists and her Nightsisters. Talzin refused his generous offer. Talzin then asked Dooku if knew the Sith warrior, [[Maul|Darth Maul]]. Dooku remembered that he was killed 10 years ago on Naboo by Kenobi. Talzin then offered one of her [[Nightbrothers]] from Maul's [[Nightbrother village|village]], as his new assassin. Dooku, with the "loss" of Ventress and the Jedi attacks, agreed to her offer and left.<ref name="Monster" />

=====Training the brother of Darth Maul=====
{{Quote|I foresee we will do great things together. I shall teach you the ways of the dark side. Soon, your powers will rival that of the great Sith Lord Darth Maul. We will be even more powerful than Lord Sidious. We shall rule the galaxy together, my apprentice.|Dooku to Savage Opress|Monster}}
[[File:OpressTheConqueror-Devaron.png|thumb|right|320x320px|Savage Opress, Darth Tyranus' second apprentice.]]
Dooku was then given the Nightbrother, [[Savage Opress]], by Talzin on Serenno. Dooku was impressed by the Opress's sight and how Talzin described him as the fiercest of his kind, assuring him that Opress would serve Dooku well. Dooku then sent Opress on a [[Devaron massacre|mission]] to secure the [[Temple of Eedit|outpost]] on [[Devaron]] from the Republic. Dooku was then informed by Opress of his mission's success and returned to him on Serenno. Dooku then told Savage how they would do great things, be more powerful than Lord Sidious and Darth Maul, and rule the galaxy together.<ref name="Monster" />

Dooku then trained Savage in lightsaber combat and his dark side powers. Dooku was a harsh taskmaster who tortured Opress with his Sith lightning. After Dooku's first training session with Opress, he sent him on a mission to Toydaria. Dooku told him to bring King Katuunko to him alive. However, Opress failed Dooku when he kill Katuunko and brought him aboard his flagship. Dooku then punished him with his Sith lightning. Ventress then revealed herself alive and Opress's true master. The two of them then fought Dooku but were unable to defeat him. Opress then force-choked Dooku and Ventress and then tried to kill them both. Dooku and Ventress made their escape, then Dooku was then confronted by Ventress, but was able to defeat her. Just as he was about to kill her, Dooku was blinded and Ventress made her escape. Dooku then ordered his battle droids to kill Opress, but they failed to stop him from escaping.<ref name="Witches of the Mist" />

Dooku contacted the [[Citadel]]'s warden, Commander [[Osi Sobeck]] about Jedi Council Member [[Even Piell]]'s information on the [[Nexus Route]].<ref name="Counterattack">{{TCW|Counterattack}}</ref> Dooku then reprimanded Sobeck, but gives him another chance to get the information from his escaping prisoners.<ref name="Citadel Rescue">{{TCW|Citadel Rescue}}</ref>

====Battle of Mon Cala====
{{Quote|The whispering of his name can rekindle hope, and hope is something we cannot allow our enemy to possess.|Dooku to Tamson|Gungan Attack}}
During the [[Battle of Mon Cala]], Count Dooku supported the [[Quarren]] in their civil war against the [[Mon Calamari]]. The Mon Calamari King [[Yos Kolina]] had died but the Quarren led by [[Chief]]tain [[Nossor Ri]] contested his son Prince [[Lee-Char]]'s claim to the throne. Dooku dispatched Commander [[Riff Tamson]] as a Separatist observer to the Quarren on [[Mon Cala]]. Dooku was assured that Chieftain Nossori and his Quarren were with them. In return for supporting the Separatist cause, Dooku promised Tamson that Mon Cala would be his to rule. Under Dooku's orders, Mon Calamari captives from [[Mon Cala city]] were enslaved.<ref name="Water War">{{TCW|Water War}}</ref>

After the Mon Calamari and Republic received [[Gungan]] reinforcements from [[Naboo]], Dooku sent Tamson reinforcements, but ordered him to keep them in reserve. Dooku also ordered him to continue to hunt down Prince Lee-Char and reminded Nossor Ri that the Quarren had to support the war effort if they wanted Separatist support.<ref name="Gungan Attack">{{TCW|Gungan Attack}}</ref> Dooku also sent Tamson [[Karkarodon]] soldiers from his homeworld of [[Karkaris]] to secure the Separatists hold on the planet. Despite Dooku's best efforts, his plans to conquer Mon Cala collapsed after the Quarren switched sides after learning that Tamson planned to crown himself as the new ruler of Mon Cala. Together, the Quarren, Mon Calamari, Republic, Jedi, and Gungans managed to drive the Separatist from Mon Cala.<ref name="Prisoners">{{TCW|Prisoners}} </ref>

====Dealings on Naboo====
{{Quote|The Sith control everything. You just don't know it.|Dooku to Anakin Skywalker|Shadow Warrior}}
Dooku then formed an alliance with Gungan priest, [[Rish Loo]] to provoke war between the [[Naboo (people)|Naboo]] and the Gungans. Dooku promised Rish Loo that he would most influential in his new order. However, Rish Loo's plans were exposed by Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, Senator Amidala, and Representative Binks freed Boss [[Lyonie]] from his mind-control. Dooku informed his master of General Grievous's capture by the Gungans. Dooku agreed to capture Skywalker in order to trade him for Grievous. Dooku had Rish Loo lure Skywalker to his [[Rish Loo's laboratory|lab]]. Once there, Dooku killed Rish Loo for his foolishness. Dooku and his magnaGuards fought Skywalker, eventually subduing him. Dooku then contacted Amidala, offering to exchange Skywalker for General Grievous. At first, Amidala refused, but agreed to it when Dooku's magnaguards started to torture Skywalker.<ref name="Shadow Warrior">{{TCW|Shadow Warrior}}</ref>

====Dealing with slavers====
Dooku then accompanied [[Zygerrian]] slaver, Commander [[Darts D'Nar]], and his forces as they moved into "occupy" the Togruta colony of [[Kiros]]. Dooku then convinced the governor, [[Roshti]], to be taken to a "safe haven". Dooku and Zygerrian Prime Minister [[Atai Molec]] then contacted him as he negotiated with General Kenobi. Dooku then ordered D'Nar to bring Kenobi to him on his knees.<ref name="Kidnapped">{{TCW|Kidnapped}}</ref> Dooku and half of Scintel's kingdom then demanded the Zygerrian Queen, [[Miraj Scintel]] to kill Anakin Skywalker.<ref name="Slaves of the Republic">{{TCW|Slaves of the Republic}}</ref>

When she refused, Dooku was asked to come to Zygerria by Prime Minister Molec. Lord Sidious sent Dooku to ensure that Queen would carry out Skywalker's execution. Dooku then spoke with the Queen and the Prime Minister about Skywalker and his friends' situation. Dooku was intrigued by her plan to enslave the Jedi, but Dooku's plan was to eradicate the Jedi. He also warned her that her power over Skywalker was an illusion, since he was once a Jedi. When queen refused to allow Dooku to execute Skywalker, Molec saw her as unworthy as being queen and Dooku force-choke Scintel as Skywalker arrived. Dooku then fought Skywalker. Dooku then ordered the Royal guard to kill Skywalker for the Queen's murder before he escaped. Dooku then contacted Keeper [[Agruss]] and ordered him to execute Kenobi and Captain Rex.<ref name="Escape from Kadavo">{{TCW|Escape from Kadavo}}</ref>

Dooku later appeared through hologram to [[Lux Bonteri]] in which he denied killing Mina Bonteri and ordered him killed for treason.<ref name="A Friend in Need" />

====Kidnapping plot====
Dooku then hired bounty hunter [[Moralo Eval]] to carry out a kidnapping of Palpatine. Following Eval's escape with help from fellow bounty hunters [[Cad Bane]] and [[Rako Hardeen]] (Kenobi in disguise)<ref name="Friends & Enemies">{{TCW|Friends and Enemies}}</ref>, Dooku brought other bounty hunters to participate in this mission for him. He tested them by putting them inside the [[box]]. Dooku became impressed with Hardeen's performance, especially how he was able to kill Kenobi. Dooku then had Eval fight Hardeen till he lost. He then appointed Bane as leader of this team to carry out Palpatine's kidnapping.<ref name="The Box">{{TCW|The Box}}</ref>

On Naboo, Dooku listened to Bane's plans. However, he implanted a listening device in Hardeen's rifle case, revealing that he knew that Hardeen was Kenobi all along. The bounty hunter's mission was merely a diversion to distract the Republic troops, while Dooku carried out the kidnapping. However, his plan was foiled by Kenobi and Skywalker who managed to stop his plot before he escaped.<ref name="Crisis on Naboo">{{TCW|Crisis on Naboo}}</ref>

====Extermination of the Nightsisters====

[[File:Epguide419.png|thumb|left|220x220px|Talzin tortures Tyranus with magick.]]
Remembering their treachery with Savage Opress, Dooku, at the behest of Lord Sidious, dispatched General Grievous to [[Battle of Dathomir|wipe out]] Mother Talzin, Ventress and the Nightsisters on Dathomir. However, Dooku was tortured by Talzin through her [[magick]], demanding he call off Grievous and his army. Dooku contacted Grievous, ordering him to find Talzin before she killed him. Dooku was saved when Grievous apparently "killed" Talzin in a secret chamber of the Nightsister village.<ref name="Massacre" />

Following the Nightsister massacre, Dooku spoke with Grievous about Savage Opress. He feared that with Talzin gone, Savage would be a danger to him and his master, as he was becoming more powerful. Dooku also sensed something else coming.<ref name="Brothers">{{TCW|Brothers}}</ref>

====Onderon rebellion====
Dooku then supported [[Sanjay Rash]] as he usurped the throne of Onderon from [[Ramsis Dendup]]. Following Rash's reports of the [[Onderon rebels|rebels]], Dooku dispatched [[Super tactical droid]] general, [[Kalani (super tactical droid)|Kalani]] to take command of the Separatist forces.<ref name="Front Runners">{{TCW|Front Runners}}</ref> Following the rebels victory over the [[HMP droid gunship|droid gunships]], Dooku ordered Kalani to withdraw what remained of the occupation force to [[Agamar]], much to Rash's disapproval which ended with his death<ref name="Tipping Points">{{TCW|Tipping Points}}</ref>.

Still having a score to settle with Hondo Ohnaka for holding him captive in the past, Dooku dispatched General Grievous to Florrum to seize and dismantle all of Ohnaka's possessions. He then had Grievous take Ohnaka away to a prison cell. Ohnaka survived the assault but much of his base was left in ruins.<ref name="A Necessary Bond">{{TCW|A Necessary Bond}}</ref>

====Alliance with Ravna====
{{Quote|How many times must I tell you, Kenobi? Do not underestimate the power of the Dark side!|Dooku|Tales from Vader's Castle 2: Count Dooku: Prince of Darkness!}}
Dooku traveled to [[Bray]]. There, he met the [[Dark Lord]] [[Ravna]] at the [[Citadel of Light]] and created a agreement between himself and Ravna. Dooku hoped to use Ravna's infection to affect millions of clones to end the Clone War and destroy the Jedi. When Kenobi and Galia arrived at the Citadel, Dooku introduced the Jedi to Ravna and subdued Gallia with his Force lightning.<ref name="TFVC 2" />

However, Dooku was betrayed by Ravna and infected by her. After destroying his super battle droid, Dooku stood by as Ravna's followers attempted to infect Kenobi and Galia. However, Dooku gave into his anger when Kenobi insulted him and called him pathetic. Dooku, giving in to his anger, used his lightning to attack Ravna. He told Kenobi and Galia to destroy Ravna's fellow creatures. Dooku was able to survive the Citadel's collapse while Ravna was buried.<ref name="TFVC 2" />

====Order 66 revelation====
[[File:Trench presents Tup.png|thumb|left|220x220px|Dooku orders Trench to take Tup to him via hologram]]
Dooku was later contacted by Admiral [[Trench]]. Though Trench's line [[Battle of Ringo Vinda|held]] on [[Ringo Vinda]], he informed Dooku how one of the [[CT-5385|clones]] had murdered his [[Tiplar|Jedi general]] in a trance-like state. Dooku informed his master that Order 66 might be revealed. Thus Sidious ordered Dooku to kidnap the clone and examine him.<ref name="The Unknown" />

Following Trench's failed kidnapping, Dooku, going by Tyranus, contacted Kaminoan Prime Minister [[Lama Su]] about the trooper. Dooku then asked for the inhibitor chip.<ref name="Conspiracy">{{TCW|Conspiracy}}</ref> However, the inhibitor chip was then stolen by the renegade trooper. Tyranus made it clear that only he and Sifo-Dyas know about the chip's true purpose and that the Jedi must not learn this.<ref name="Fugitive">{{TCW|Fugitive}}</ref> Following the death of the renegade trooper, Dooku was then given both chips by his master.<ref name="Orders">{{TCW|Orders}}</ref>

====Recruiting Clovis====
Dooku was then ordered by his master to name Senator [[Rush Clovis]] the head of Banking Clan. Dooku then contacted Clovis via the medical droid treating him. Dooku offered to pay the Confederacy's interest on their loans, supply Clovis details of the Muuns secret accounts, in exchange for him becoming head of the Banking Clan.<ref name="The Rise of Clovis">{{TCW|The Rise of Clovis}}</ref>

After Clovis took his position on [[Scipio]], Dooku contacted him to congratulate on his appointment. Dooku then announced that he wished collect on his "investment" or he will reveal the truth behind's Clovis's appointment. He also threatened that the Confederacy would not pay back their loans. Thus Dooku forced to raise the Republic's interest rates to keep the bank afloat. Dooku then accompanied the Confederate fleet and went to Clovis's office. Dooku informs her of the deal he made with Clovis. Dooku ordered her arrest, but [[Separatist Congress Leader/Legends|Confederate Congress leader]], [[Bec Lawise]], said that their Senate would not approve of this. Dooku then forced Amidala to shoot Lawise. Dooku then left aboard [[Kraken]]'s flagship and ordered their forces to withdraw from Scipio.<ref name="Crisis at the Heart">{{TCW|Crisis at the Heart}}</ref>

====Tyranus revealed====
{{Quote|I told you everything you needed to know on Geonosis. All those years ago, Kenobi. You should have joined me. Sifo-Dyas understood. He saw the future. That is why he helped me. |Dooku|The Lost One}}
Tyranus was then informed by Sidious that the Jedi had learned of a secret that Dooku failed to hide. Dooku then learned that the Pykes had kept Silman, the former Chancellor's [[Finis Valorum|Valorum]] aide who accompanied Sifo-Dyas, alive. Dooku then went to [[Oba Diah]] to eliminate this loose end by killing Silman. However, Dooku was confronted by Kenobi and Skywalker. He fought them before he was surrounded by Lom Pyke and his men, who revealed that he was Tyranus.<ref name="The Lost 1" /> Dooku revealed that he was telling Kenobi the truth on Geonosis about the Sith Lord.<ref name="Episode II" /> Dooku then killed Lom Pyke and escaped.<ref name="The Lost 1" />

[[File:Dark side ritual.png|thumb|300x300px|Darth Sidious and Darth Tyranus summoning the power of dark illusion to attack Yoda.]]
Dooku was then informed that Lord Sidious demanded his presence on Coruscant. Both he and Lord Sidious felt that Yoda was on the Sith homeworld of [[Moraband]] for some unknown reason. Dooku then allowed Sidious to use his blood to create [[Dark illusion|an illusion]] to Yoda due to him being his former master using both their Sith lightning. However they failed in breaking Yoda and knew they needed more time.<ref name="Sacrifice">{{TCW|Sacrifice}}</ref>

====Crystal Crisis on Utapau====
Towards the end of the Clone Wars, Count Dooku and General Grievous took interest in a massive [[kyber crystal]] on the neutral planet of [[Utapau]]. They hired several [[Sugi]] mercenaries led by [[Endente]] and [[Amani]] outcasts to excavate the crystal and to guard it respectively. Dooku and Grievous were also aided by [[Governor]] [[Torul Blom]], who had secret contacts with Endente. When the [[Jedi Master]] [[Tu-Anh]] stumbled upon their operation, the Separatists sent two IG-100 MagnaGuards to assassinate her. However, her death attracted the attention of Master Kenobi and the Jedi Knight Skywalker, who [[Mission to Utapau|traveled]] to Utapau to investigate.<ref name="A Death on Utapau">{{TCW|A Death on Utapau}}</ref>

Investigating Tu-Anh's death and the presence of MagnaGuards, Kenobi and Skywalker traveled to the plains of Utapau to investigate a group of Amani outcasts. While traveling through Utapau's wilderness, the two Jedi were captured by several Sugi mercenaries who brought them to Endente, who informed them about the Confederacy's interest in the kyber crystal. When the Jedi offered to buy the crystal for twice the amount, Endente informed Dooku via [[hologram]] about the Jedi and demanded more compensation to offset the Jedi offer. Dooku ordered him to kill the Jedi and promised that he would send Grievous to "give him what he deserved." Later, the two Jedi managed to overpower their captors and steal the crystal.<ref name="In Search of the Crystal">{{TCW|In Search of the Crystal}}</ref>

[[File:Big Bang Ep.png|thumb|left|250px|Kenobi and Skywalker foiled Dooku's plot to obtain a kyber crystal from Utapau.]]
As Endente and his Sugi comrades prepared for a counter-assault to recover the kyber crystal, they were contacted by Dooku who informed him that Grievous was coming to meet them on the plains of Utapau. Fearful of reporting his failure to the Sith, Endente told Dooku to send Grievous to meet them at Pau City instead on the pretext that the Amani could no longer be relied upon to guard the crystal. Endente informed the Sith Lord that they had a friend in the Utapau government, Governor Blom. Despite their efforts, Endente and his forces failed to recover the crystal from the Jedi, who made their way to Pau City's [[spaceport]].<ref name="Crystal Crisis">{{TCW|Crystal Crisis}}</ref>

Grievous eventually learned of Endente's failure and executed the Sugi mercenary. After a struggle, Grievous, with the help of Governor Blom, managed to recover the crystal from the Jedi and loaded it onto his shuttle.<ref name="Crystal Crisis" /> Grievous managed to load the crystal onto his [[DH-Omni Support Vessel|supply ship]]. The Jedi followed him aboard but Dooku managed to capture Kenobi. Following Kenobi's capture, Grievous gave a report to Dooku, who ordered him to execute Master Kenobi and to deliver the crystal urgently to Serenno; stressing that he would tolerate no failure. Despite Grievous' efforts, the two Jedi managed to destroy the crystal and Grievous' fleet. Grievous alone escaped to report the failure to his master.<ref name="The Big Bang">{{TCW|The Big Bang}}</ref>

====The Dark Disciple and Asajj Ventress====
{{Quote|Vos is a Dark Lord, as I am, and he knows better than to turn against his kind.''"<br />"''A Dark Lord?''"<br />"''Oh, yes. He has sworn allegiance to the dark side. He and I will take down Lord Sidious once and for all, and rule the galaxy together. Hopefully, you'll have been disposed of by then.|Dooku to Ventress|Dark Disciple}}
[[File:Darkdisciple.png|thumb|200px|Quinlan Vos teamed up with Asajj Ventress to assassinate Dooku, but he then became the Sith Lord's third apprentice.]]
During the waning days of the Clone Wars, Count Dooku commanded an [[Attack on Mahranee|assault]] on the planet [[Mahranee]], which led to the genocide of the [[Mahran]] species. In addition, Dooku also issued orders that all Mahran be killed on sight. Dooku's assault was witnessed by the Jedi Council on Coruscant, who at the suggestion of Master Obi-Wan hatched an unusual plan partnering maverick Jedi Master [[Quinlan Vos]] with the Nightsister [[bounty hunter]] and Dooku's former apprentice Asajj Ventress. After partnering with Ventress as a bounty hunter, Vos eventually revealed his true identity. Seeking revenge against Dooku for his actions against her and her people, Ventress agreed to help Vos by training him in the ways of the dark side.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

[[File:Ciscapitalcity.png|thumb|left|220px|Dooku was confronted by Ventress and Vos in Raxulon.]]
After Vos completed his training, Ventress received word from the Separatist contact [[Sumdin]] that Dooku was going to visit [[Raxus]], where he was due to receive the [[Raxian Humanitarian Award]] for his services to the Confederacy. For that trip, Dooku was accompanied by his military commander General Grievous. Before receiving the award, Dooku gave a patriotic speech to a large crowd defending the Separatist cause and attacking the Republic and the Jedi. During the public banquet, Asajj took the opportunity to meet up with Dooku and challenge him to a duel at the overlook nearby. Dooku agreed but secretly contacted Grievous for reinforcements. However, Vos anticipated this and managed to lock Grievous in a room.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

Together, Ventress and Vos [[Mission to Raxus|confronted]] Dooku at the overlook. After exchanging pleasantries over a glass of [[Alderaanian wine]], Dooku engaged the assassins in a lightsaber duel. Using his mastery of the dark side, Dooku overpowered the two assassins and used the Force to hurl them against some nearby pillars. Despite Vos' best efforts, he was unable to best Dooku and was taken captive by the Sith Lord. Ventress managed to escape following a scuffle with Grievous but was unable to rescue her lover Vos. Dooku then struck Vos unconscious with Force lightning and spirited his Jedi captive away to his palace on Serenno.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

[[File:DookuVilla-Nightsisters.png|thumb|320x320px|Dooku's palace on Serreno, where Vos was endlessly tortured and eventually turned to the Dark Side.]]
On Serenno, Count Dooku [[torture]]d Quinlan Vos for a prolonged period. To sow discord between Vos and Ventress, he showed the Jedi Master a hologram of Ventress [[Battle of unidentified planet (Tholme and Ventress)|killing]] his former Master [[Tholme]]. When Vos initially refused to believe Dooku's account, the Sith Lord presented Vos with Tholme's lightsaber. Using his [[Psychometry|psychometric]] abilities, Vos realized that Dooku was telling the truth. Shortly later, Ventress and Boba Fett's [[Boba Fett's syndicate|bounty hunter syndicate]] launched a [[Mission to Serenno (Boba Fett's syndicate)|mission]] to rescue Vos. However, they were forced to flee empty-handed after Vos, who had given in to the dark side, attacked Ventress. Following the attack, Vos became Dooku's new [[Sith apprentice]]. Despite turning to the Separatist side, Vos secretly planned to force Dooku to lead him to his master, Darth Sidious, and then kill the two Sith Lords.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

Together, Dooku and his new right-hand man Quinlan Vos launched a renewed military military campaign against the Republic. Vos quickly gained the moniker "[[Admiral]] Enigma" among the Republic media. After receiving intelligence from Admiral [[Wullf Yularen]] that Dooku was planning to attack the planet [[Taris]], the Jedi Council hatched a [[Rescue of Quinlan Vos|mission to rescue]] Quinlan Vos. With the help of Ventress, Kenobi and his former apprentice Anakin Skywalker infiltrated Dooku's [[Providence-class dreadnought|''Providence''-class dreadnought]] and made their way to the [[Bridge (starship)|bridge]], hoping to encounter "Admiral Enigma". Instead, they encountered Dooku. While Skywalker dueled with Dooku, Ventress and Kenobi managed to "rescue" Vos from his cell. However, Vos and Dooku had anticipated the rescue and arranged for Vos to appear in an emaciated state. While Ventress sensed that Vos had turned to the dark side, his Jedi colleagues eagerly welcomed Vos home.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

Quinlan Vos' "rescue" gave Count Dooku a high-level spy within the Jedi Order. Using his high-placed position within the Jedi hierarchy, Vos leaked intelligence on two Republic operations to Dooku. This allowed the Separatists to sabotage an asteroid supplies warehouse and to evacuate [[Vanqor listening post|a]] [[listening post]] on Vanqor prior to a Republic [[Destruction of the Vanqor listening post|attack]]. After discerning that Vos had turned to the dark side, the Jedi Council sent Vos on a mission to kill Dooku. With the help of Ventress, Vos and the Jedi learned that Dooku's dreadnought was last sighted above the crystal-covered planet of Christophsis. Vos managed to infiltrate Dooku's dreadnought and engaged the Sith Lord in a lightsaber duel. Despite besting Dooku, Vos refused to kill him and instead demanded that Dooku lead him to Darth Sidious.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

Unknown to both Dooku and Vos, they had been tailed by Kenobi and Skywalker. The two Jedi Knights promptly arrested Dooku and his apprentice and transported them to the [[Venator-class Star Destroyer|''Venator''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Vigilance]]'' as prisoners. While being marched to the ''Vigilance's'' brig, Vos managed to free Dooku, who in turned freed Vos. After killing the Jedi Knights [[Akar-Deshu]] and [[Kav Bayons]] and two dozen Clone troopers, the two dark siders escaped the ''Vigilance'' aboard Ventress' ship ''[[Banshee (starship)|Banshee]]''. Ventress attempted to fly them back to Dooku's dreadnought but they were shot down by the ''Vigilance'' and crash-landed on Christophsis.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

Dooku and his fellow travelers survived the crash but the Count sustained a serious injury since he had not been properly strapped in. After navigating through Christophsis' crystal-covered landscape, they managed to reach a local [[Christophsis Separatist tower|Separatist base]] that was built into a giant crystal tower. Upon arriving, Dooku was informed that Darth Sidious was seeking an audience with him. During a brief hologram conversation, Dooku requested help from his master to get offworld. Shortly later, Kenobi and Skywalker launched a [[Second battle of Christophsis|full-scale assault]] on the Separatist base.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

Together, Dooku and his opponents made their way into an outlying crystal sanctum. On the way, Dooku was struck by a blaster blast and was knocked unconscious. While Ventress wanted to let him die, Vos insisted on keeping him alive. While Vos assisted the battle droids in the defense of the base, Ventress moved Dooku into the crystal sanctum. After stirring, Dooku taunted Ventress by deriding her as a "grant" and claiming that Vos had much potential as a Sith Lord. Ventress responded that Vos had "bigger plans" for Dooku. When Vos entered the sanctum, Ventress confronted him about his decision to join Dooku and the dark side.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

While Ventress and Vos were preoccupied, Dooku took the opportunity to attack his former pupils with Force lightning. He wanted to kill Vos, but ended up striking Ventress, who pushed Vos out of the way. Though Quinlan managed to stop Dooku, Ventress was mortally wounded. Dooku then attempted to goad Vos into killing him, but realizing that the act of murder led to the dark side, Vos refused and reaffirmed his Jedi identity. While Vos comforted his dying lover, Dooku took the opportunity to rendezvous with Sidious' starship and fled off-world. Despite failing to kill Dooku, Vos was pardoned by the Jedi Council after he rejected the dark side and continued serving the Jedi war effort.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

====Search for Darth Maul====
{{Quote|I left you here to make you an offer. While Grievous is a creature of limited scope, you see much more. You abandoned the Jedi when you understood the Sith were gaining power. Now I suggest you abandon Sidious and serve me.|Maul tempting Dooku to join him|Darth Maul—Son of Dathomir, Part Three}}
[[File:SonOfDathomir3.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Darth Tyranus captured by his predecessor, Darth Maul.]]
Dooku assisted his master in interrogating his former apprentice, Darth Maul, about his [[Shadow Collective]] at the [[Spire (Stygeon Prime)|Spire]] on [[Stygeon Prime]]. However, Maul then made his [[Escape from the Spire|escape]] with his [[Mandalorian super commando]]s to [[Zanbar]]. Dooku then dispatched General Grievous and [[Tey-Zuka]] to [[Battle of Zanbar|attack]] and cripple Maul and his forces. Dooku then contacted Grievous after Maul's forces retreated. Dooku hoped this attack would draw Talzin out.<ref name="Son of Dathomir 1">''[[Darth Maul—Son of Dathomir, Part One]]''</ref>

Dooku, accompanied by a pair of MagnaGuards, then went to [[Ord Mantell]] to [[Battle on Ord Mantell|capture]] Maul and level the city. Dooku was then confronted by Brother [[Viscus]] and the Nightbrothers. Dooku was easily able to defeat the Viscus and his men. However, Dooku was then surrounded by Maul's forces before he had the chance to kill the defeated Viscus.<ref name="Son of Dathomir 2">''[[Darth Maul—Son of Dathomir, Part Two]]''</ref>

[[File:Dooku_Kills_Tiplee.png|thumb|250px|Darth Tyranus kills Tiplee.]]
Dooku was offered a deal by Maul; to abandon Lord Sidious and serve Maul. Dooku refused, knowing that Sidious was more powerful than they realized. Maul told him that together with Talzin, they would be Sidious's undoing. Dooku then spoke with Talzin, warning that betraying Sidious is a folly. Talzin told him that Sidious was ready to replace him with a new apprentice. She then revealed to Dooku how Sidious came to her promising to make her his right hand but betrayed her when he took Maul. She also revealed that Maul was her son. When the Republic forces boarded their ship, Dooku decided to assist Maul in killing the Jedi, but not before secretly freeing Grievous. Together they [[Assault on Vizsla Keep 09|fought]] [[Jedi General]]s, Mace Windu, [[Aayla Secura]], Obi-Wan Kenobi and Tiplee. Dooku then killed Tiplee and then escaped with Maul and Commanders [[Gar Saxon|Saxon]] and [[Rook Kast|Kast]] aboard a gauntlet fighter.<ref name="Son of Dathomir 3">''[[Darth Maul—Son of Dathomir, Part Three]]''</ref>

Dooku was then taken to Dathomir by Maul. There, he was taken to a chamber in the Nightbrother village to have his life-force taken from him to allow Talzin to regain her form. Dooku was then possessed by Talzin when Grievous and Sidious arrived. However, she was no match [[Second battle of Dathomir|against]] Sidious' skill while inside Dooku's body. Dooku was freed when Talzin became whole. He then assisted his master in fighting Talzin until Grievous killed her. Despite Maul's escape, Sidious assured Dooku that their future was certain.<ref name="Son of Dathomir 4">''[[Darth Maul—Son of Dathomir, Part Four]]''</ref>

====Death====
{{Quote|You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive."<br />"Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner. I shouldn't have done that. It's not the Jedi way."<br />"It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge.|Palpatine and Anakin Skywalker musing over Dooku's death|Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith}}
[[File:Dooku%27s_head_Flies_off.png|thumb|left|180px|Dooku is beheaded by Skywalker.]]
Later on, Dooku oversaw the "kidnapping" of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine during the battle of Coruscant. Dooku held Chancellor Palpatine captive aboard General Grievous's flagship, the ''[[Invisible Hand]]''. He engaged Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi in a lightsaber duel when they came to the Chancellor's rescue. The duel was brief but fierce. Dooku defeated Kenobi, who was incapacitated and knocked unconscious when the Count used the Force to pin Kenobi to the ground with a metal balcony. However, Dooku was soon overpowered by Skywalker, who with one slash of his lightsaber, severed both the Count's hands at the wrists. Skywalker then caught Dooku's lightsaber out of the air and crossed it with his own blade at the Count's throat. Unsure how to proceed, Skywalker hesitated until Chancellor Palpatine instructed him to kill the Count. Despite the fact that Dooku was an unarmed prisoner, Skywalker drew the two lightsabers together, decapitating the Sith Lord.<ref name="Episode III" />

===Legacy===
{{Quote|The end of the war is near, General."<br />"But the loss of Count Dooku?"<br />"His death was... a ''necessary'' loss. Soon I will have a new apprentice, one far younger and more ''powerful''. |Darth Sidious to General Grievous|Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith}}
[[File:DarthVaderBust-TESB.png|thumb|190x190px|Darth Vader, Darth Tyranus' killer and successor.]]
Not long after killing Dooku, Skywalker replaced him at Sidious' side after he too fell to the dark side and became Darth Vader. Vader destroyed the Jedi Order and killed, with help of the Clones, almost all Jedi.<ref name="Episode III" />

Following the end of the Clone Wars, the newly-created [[Imperial Security Bureau|Security Bureau]] of the [[Galactic Empire]] conducted loyalty purges, during which much [[propaganda]] material featuring Dooku was destroyed. However, rare specimens of [[Ansibella Delu]]'s [[Count Dooku: Words of Truth|work-in-progress poster]] survived those purges.<ref name="Propaganda" />

Additionally, speculation began to circulate after the war's end that Dooku had in fact never left the Jedi Order despite their claims to the contrary. This rumor bolstered the idea that the Jedi had been traitors to the Republic since before the start of the war but some, amongst them Grand Moff Tarkin, remained skeptical.<ref name="Tarkin" />

[[31 ABY|50 years]] after Dooku's death, a treasure hunt known as the [[Race for the Lost Treasure of Count Dooku]] occurred on [[Ponemah Terminal]]. Those taking part hoped to find Kyber crystals, but were surprised to find the treasure was a [[Clone trooper]] who had been held captive for the last 50 years. The trooper, clone [[medic]] [[Kix]], had learned the truth of Order 66 after being confronted about it by his friend and fellow trooper [[CT-5555]], otherwise known as Fives. In the end the trooper was saved the pirate crew of [[Sidon Ithano]], after being caught up on galactic history he joined the crew. <ref name="Lost Treasure">"[[The Crimson Corsair and the Lost Treasure of Count Dooku]]"</ref>

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Do…it. The lightning wasn't…for her. It was for you. She just…got in the way. Go on. ''Take…your revenge!''|Dooku tempting his last apprentice, Vos, to strike him down after mortally wounding Ventress.|Dark Disciple}}
[[File:SecessionistMovement.png|thumb|left|250px|Dooku was a charismatic statesman deft at manipulation and deception.]]
Dooku was an aging [[human]] male who had light skin, [[Color|brown]] [[eye]]s, white [[hair]],<ref name="Episode II" /> and a height of 1.93 [[meter]]s.<ref name="Databank" /> He was a connoisseur of [[wine]], and favoured technique over brute strength in lightsaber combat.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

Dooku was once a respected Jedi,<ref name="Databank" /> viewed as a "political idealist" by his peers.<ref name="Episode II" /> However, he became disillusioned with the Jedi Order<ref name="Databank" /> and the corruption within the Republic, eventually coming to desire the downfall of both institutions he once served.<ref name="Episode II" /> In his thirst for greater power, Dooku turned away from the light and ultimately joined the dark side of the Force. As a Sith Lord, Darth Tyranus was a menacing, intelligent, powerful, manipulative, arrogant and amoral, yet charismatic statesman<ref name="Databank" /> whose methods included torture,<ref name="Shadow Warrior" /> assassination,<ref name="Episode II" /> and even genocide.<ref name="Dark Disciple" /> He was also willing to betray his own followers and allies such as Asajj Ventress and Pre Vizsla, though he showed some regret over abandoning Ventress, angering his own master, Darth Sidious.<ref name="Nightsisters" /> Dooku was very vindictive, as shown when he ordered devastating attacks against Mother Talzin and Hondo Ohnaka for crossing him in the past.<ref name="Massacre" /> Dooku was also quite fearless, and was willing to sacrifice himself in a final attempt to fully convert his last apprentice, Quinlan Vos, to the dark side by tempting Vos to strike him down after he mortally wounded Vos' lover, Ventress.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

At the time of his death, Dooku was in a state of disbelief due to Sidious encouraging Anakin Skywalker to kill the disarmed and beaten Count. For a fleeting moment, Dooku gained a new understanding of what had transpired<ref name="Databank" />&mdash;he had been used and betrayed by his own secret master.<ref name="Databank BG">{{Databank|count-dooku-biography-gallery|Count Dooku Biography Gallery}}</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
{{Quote|I am more powerful than any Jedi. Know that you are dealing with a Sith Lord.|Count Dooku|Dooku Captured}}
[[File:SonOfDathomir2.jpg|thumb|180px|Darth Tyranus facing Nightbrothers on Ord Mantell.]]
Dooku was a highly skillful lightsaber duelist even in his old age. During his time as a Jedi he was known as one of the Order's finest swordsmen; it was said that only Mace Windu could have fought him as an equal, and only Yoda was his superior. On Geonosis, Dooku was able to easily defeat both Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker one immediately after the other, and then go on to fight Yoda himself. Dooku proved able to compete with Yoda but was unable to defeat his former master and was forced to retreat. He would often prove to be equal and even superior to Anakin and Kenobi even as their skill grew during the Clone Wars, dueling Anakin on several occasions to a stalemate and even both simultaneously on at least one occasion. Dooku was a practitioner of the second form of lightsaber combat, [[Form II|Makashi]]. Makashi was a rarity among the Jedi by the time of the Clone Wars; it was a style designed specifically for lightsaber-to-lightsaber combat, and as such it was considered obsolete in a time when most Jedi were more likely to face blaster-wielding opponents. The style's rarity gave Dooku an advantage when engaging in lightsaber duels, as few of his enemies were trained to defend themselves against it. Makashi relied on precision, speed, and economy of movement rather than wide-sweeping strikes that characterized later styles, and [[Dooku's lightsaber|Dooku's curved-hilt lightsaber]] was designed especially for that. However, in spite of his almost unrivalled sword mastery and decades of experience, Dooku was still vulnerable to Form II's greatest weakness; its lack of kinetic power. This was demonstrated during several of his encounters with Anakin Skywalker, particularly in instances where Anakin was significantly angered. During Dooku's attempt to kidnap Palpatine on Naboo, the Count was very nearly overwhelmed by Anakin's brutally direct [[Form V|Djem So]] attacks, and managed to fend Anakin off only through use of the Force. During their final encounter onboard the ''Invincible'', Dooku suffered the same issue but Skywalker's power had by that time significantly increased.<ref name="Episode III" /> The young Jedi's ferocious swordplay battered through Dooku's defenses, draining his [[Personal Force reservoir|reserves of Force energy]] and leaving him physically exhausted.<ref name="Star Wars CEUE">''[[Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded]]''</ref>

In addition to his formidable lightsaber skills, Dooku was enormously powerful and skilled in the use of the Force. He demonstrated great prowess and strength in the use of telekinesis. During his duels with Ventress and his escape from Hondo's pirates, he displayed great skill at using telekinesis in finer, more precise tasks, such as disarming Ventress while also levitating her against a wall during her failed attempt to kill him with Savage Oppress. He was even capable of telekinetically manipulating people's motor skills, such as when he [[Force choke]]d while simultaneously forcing Turk Falso to take out his blaster and shoot his comrade, while he performed a similar feat when he made Padme Amidala aim at and shoot Bec Lawise.<ref name="TGG">{{TCW|The Gungan General}}</ref><ref name="HOBS">{{TCW|Heroes on Both Sides}}</ref> He was also highly skilled in the use of Force lightning, using it as both a means of torture and execution, and was able to use it in conjunction with telekinesis, usually to send a person flying with his lightning or even to levitate his opponents while using his lightning on them, as he demonstrated on Ventress and two Nightsister assassins.<ref name="Episode II" /><ref name="Nightsisters" />

==Behind the scenes==
===Portrayal===
{{Quote|He's very aloof, very self-contained, obviously completely fearless. He is extremely intelligent, perhaps more so than almost anyone else. He's obviously a man of immense power. I don't suppose that the question of moral values enter into his head. He's not immoral -- he's amoral. Morality is a word that doesn't figure in his vocabulary at all. It's power. Which is something that exists very much in our world today.|Sir Christopher Lee's thoughts on his character Dooku.|url=http://www.starwars.com/episode-ii/bts/profile/beacon85.html}}
[[File:Lee Lucas EP2 BTS.png|thumb|left|200px|Christopher Lee with George Lucas on the set of ''Attack of the Clones''.]]
Dooku was portrayed by Sir [[Christopher Lee]] in [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']] and [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]. [[Kyle Rowling]] portrayed Dooku during most of the character's lightsaber sequences, due to Lee's inability to enact these physical scenes because of his age. Rowling's head was digitally replaced with Lee's during post-production.<ref name="Episode II Cast and Crew">[http://www.starwars.com/episode-ii/bts/castcrew.html Episode II Cast and Crew]</ref>

Dooku's character underwent multiple development iterations during the creative process of ''Attack of the Clones''; artists [[Iain McCaig]] and [[Dermot Power]] experimented with various female Sith designs, including dark queens, robotic warriors and vampiric witches as well as a shape-shifting alien concept that eventually evolved into [[Zam Wesell]], until [[George Lucas]] eventually decided on the idea of a battle-scarred Jedi warrior who parted ways with the Jedi Order. The final designs of the character were intended to reflect the menacing atmosphere conveyed by [[Peter Cushing]]'s portrayal of [[Grand Moff]] Wilhuff Tarkin in [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']].<ref name="old-db-bts">{{DB|character|countdooku|Count Dooku}}</ref>

In an earlier revision of the script for ''Revenge of the Sith'', Dooku was originally planned to survive until the midpoint of the film, with his [[death]] being the final push [[Anakin Skywalker]] needed to join the [[dark side of the Force]] rather than his role in the death of [[Mace Windu]]. However, it was ultimately decided to move Dooku's demise to the opening sequence, which was also changed from its original conception.<ref>''[[The Art of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]''</ref>

Christopher Lee reprised his role in the [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' film]], while [[Corey Burton]] voiced Dooku in the [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|subsequent TV series]].

The distinctive curved shape of Dooku's lightsaber handle was a result of earlier exploration into Sith villains. Art Department Assistant Roel Robles drew inspiration from various Filipino swords, knives, and spears; one of them, the [[wikipedia:Barong (knife)|barong]] had a curved handle which provided a firmer grip for its bearer.<ref name="old-db-bts" />

===Character origins===
The name "Dooku" was based on the [[Wikipedia:Japanese language|Japanese]] word "doku," meaning poison.<ref name="Lord of Misrule: The Autobiography of Christopher Lee">''[[Christopher Lee#Recent Bibliography|Lord of Misrule: The Autobiography of Christopher Lee]]''</ref> In the [[Wikipedia:Galician language|Galician]] and [[Wikipedia:Portuguese language|Portuguese]] languages, "do cu," pronounced exactly as in "Dooku," means "from the ass" or "of the ass". For this reason, Dooku's name was changed to "Dookan" in [[Wikipedia:Brazil|Brazil]].<ref name="Globo">[http://epoca.globo.com/especiais/starwars/pers.htm Reporting about ''Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'' in Época magazine]</ref>

''Tyranus''&mdash;or more properly, ''Tyrannos''&mdash;is an ancient [[Wikipedia:Greek language|Greek]] word, originally used to describe someone who ruled a city-state after overthrowing the preexisting government. It was a legitimate form of government and the word's meaning was not unfavorable in itself, but over time, as democracy developed, it gained negative connotations and came to mean "oppressor" or "tyrant."<ref name="Tyrant">{{WP|Tyrant}}</ref>
