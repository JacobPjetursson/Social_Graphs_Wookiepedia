==Personality and traits==

Even at a young age, Hera's old friend and crew member, [[Sabine Wren]], recognized that Syndulla was born to fly just like his mother. He also had blue eyes and light skin.<ref name="Family Reunion ‚Äì and Farewell" />

==Behind the scenes==
{{Quote|It seemed, in a very small way, naming him 'Jacen' was a way to honor the expanded universe character of Jacen Solo who just really isn't there anymore as the timelines have changed. I thought that's a little bit of a wink to people that I know that was an important character. And maybe, in some way, that lives on through this character. I don't know yet.|Dave Filoni on Jacen Syndulla's namesake|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/lucasfilm-creatives-are-very-interested-in-that-new-sta-1823646768}}

Jacen Syndulla was introduced in the epilogue of "[[Family Reunion ‚Äì and Farewell]]," the series finale of ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''.<ref name="Family Reunion ‚Äì and Farewell" /> His first name, Jacen, was inspired by [[Darth Caedus|Jacen Solo]], the son of [[Leia Organa Solo]] and [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]] in the [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] continuity.<ref name="SW.com Twitter">{{Twitter|starwars|status/970856627401211904|''[[Star Wars]]''|quote=Spelled exactly like you're hoping it is. üòâ #StarWarsRebels|image=File:Jacen Syndulla Star Wars Twitter.png|noimage=}}</ref>

The decision to introduce Jacen Syndulla in the series finale was one that executive producer [[Dave Filoni]] had been thinking of throughout production on the [[Star Wars Rebels Season Four|fourth season]]. He initially only shared his idea with [[Kiri Hart]], the head of the [[Lucasfilm Story Group]], who was supportive of the character's introduction. Filoni deliberately chose the name Jacen as a way of honoring the character of Jacen Solo and his importance in the stories of ''[[Star Wars]]'' Legends.<ref name="Filoni io9">{{Cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/lucasfilm-creatives-are-very-interested-in-that-new-sta-1823646768|title=Lucasfilm Creatives Are Very Interested in That New ''Star Wars Rebels'' Character|first=Germain|last=Lussier|work=io9|date=March 9, 2018|accessdate=March 9, 2018}}</ref> Voice actress [[Vanessa Marshall]], however, was unaware about Hera being pregnant with Jacen when she recorded the final episode, just discovering it during a fan screening.<ref name="Vanessa Fandom">{{Cite web|url=http://fandom.wikia.com/articles/star-wars-rebels-hera-syndulla-son?li_source=LI&li_medium=wikia-impactfooter|title=‚ÄòStar Wars Rebels‚Äô: Even Voice Actor Surprised By Hera Syndulla‚Äôs Fate|first=Lawrence|last=Yee|work=Fandom|date=July 31, 2018|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>

Though Filoni says he has not given much thought to where the character might go in future stories, many creatives within Lucasfilm have expressed interest in the future of the character since the ''Star Wars Rebels'' finale aired on [[March 5]], [[2018]].<ref name="Filoni io9" />
