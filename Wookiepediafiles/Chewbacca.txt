{{Quote|Chewbacca here is first mate on a ship that might suit us.|Obi-Wan Kenobi|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}
'''Chewbacca''', known affectionately to [[Sexes|his]] friends as '''Chewie''', was a [[Wookiee]] warrior, [[smuggler]], and resistance fighter who fought in the [[Clone Wars]], the [[Galactic Civil War]], and the [[Cold war|conflict]] between the [[First Order]] and the [[Resistance]]. He hailed from the [[planet]] [[Kashyyyk]] and became a Wookiee military leader. During the Clone Wars, he was captured by [[Trandoshan]] [[Slavery|slavers]] and held captive on [[Wasskah]], but he worked with a fellow captive, [[Jedi]] [[Commander]] [[Ahsoka Tano]], to escape. He later commanded Wookiee forces during the [[Battle of Kashyyyk]] alongside the [[Grand Army of the Republic]], led by [[Jedi Master]] [[Yoda]]. During the battle, one of the last ones of the war, Yoda's [[clone trooper]]s received [[Order 66]] from [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] and, with the help of Chewbacca, Yoda escaped Kashyyyk and the [[Jedi Purge|destruction]] of the [[Jedi Order]].

In the [[Standard year|years]] that followed, during the rule of the [[Galactic Empire]], Chewbacca became a smuggler and the [[Pilot|co-pilot]] of [[Captain]] [[Han Solo]] aboard the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. They worked in the employ of [[crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]] until Solo was forced to dump a shipment of [[spice]] to avoid trouble with the Empire, at which point a bounty was placed on their heads. Soon thereafter, Chewbacca and Solo were hired by Jedi Master [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] to ferry him, [[Luke Skywalker]], [[C-3PO]], and [[R2-D2]] to [[Alderaan]] on a mission vital to the survival of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. After finding Alderaan was [[The Disaster|destroyed]], the group was brought aboard the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]], where they helped [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Organa]] [[Rescue of Princess Leia|escape]] from captivity and return to the [[Great Temple (Yavin 4)|Rebel base]] on [[Yavin 4]]. Though Chewbacca and Solo initially chose to leave Yavin 4 and not join the Rebellion, they ended up fighting in the [[Battle of Yavin]] and were instrumental in Skywalker's destruction of the Death Star, a major victory for the Rebellion.

Throughout the war, Chewbacca and Solo fought the Empire in a number of engagements, including an [[Attack on Cymoon 1|assault]] on [[Cymoon 1]] and the [[Battle of Vrogas Vas|battle]] on [[Vrogas Vas]]. Along with Princess Organa and C-3PO, they escaped from [[Echo Base]] on the planet [[Hoth]] after the Empire tracked the Rebel Alliance there. The group sought refuge with [[Lando Calrissian]], an old friend of Solo's, on [[Cloud City]], but Calrissian betrayed them and turned them over to [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], the [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor's]] chief enforcer, after his city was threatened. Solo was [[Carbon-freezing|frozen]] in [[carbonite]] and Calrissian helped the others escape, but they were too late to save the frozen Solo from being taken by [[Boba Fett]] to Jabba the Hutt. Chewbacca and Calrissian set off to find Solo and located him in [[Jabba's Palace]] on [[Tatooine]], where Chewbacca and his friends [[Rescue of Han Solo|saved]] Solo and destroyed Jabba. Shortly thereafter, they fought in the [[Battle of Endor]], where Chewbacca helped destroy the [[Death Star's shield generator|shield generator]] and allowed the [[Alliance Fleet]] to destroy the [[Death Star II]]. The Emperor was killed aboard the [[battle station]], delivering a crippling blow to the Empire.

After Endor and the rise of the [[New Republic]], Chewbacca and Solo fought to [[Liberation of Kashyyyk|liberate]] Kashyyyk from the Empire. When the war finally came to a close, Chewbacca returned home to Kashyyyk with his [[Chewbacca's family|family]]. After Solo's son [[Kylo Ren|Ben]], turned to the [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]] and [[Destruction of Luke Skywalker's Jedi Temple|destroyed]] Skywalker's new generation of Jedi, Chewbacca reunited with his old friend and the two spent many years as smugglers once more. They lost the ''Millennium Falcon'' and ended up smuggling aboard a ship called the ''[[Eravana]]'', but they eventually found the ''Falcon'' and, with it, stowaways named [[Rey]], [[Finn]], and the droid [[BB-8]]. The droid had part of a map that led to the exiled Luke Skywalker, so the group brought the map to the Resistance that opposed the First Order, which had risen from the ashes of the Galactic Empire. Chewbacca soon fought in the [[Battle of Starkiller Base|assault]] to destroy [[Starkiller Base]], a devastating First Order superweapon, a conflict in which Solo lost his life at the hands of his son. After the base was destroyed, Chewbacca joined Rey in traveling to the planet [[Ahch-To]], where she found Luke Skywalker

===The Clone Wars===
{{Quote|It's a Wookiee!|Ahsoka Tano on first seeing Chewbacca|Wookiee Hunt}}
[[File:JediHideout-WH.png|thumb|275px|right|Chewbacca hides alongside Ahsoka Tano.]]
During the [[The galaxy|galaxy-spanning]] conflict between the [[Galactic Republic]] and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatists]], Chewbacca was captured by a [[Trandoshan]] hunting guild led by [[Garnac]]; taken to [[Island Four]] on [[Wasskah]] to be their prey, his transport was attacked by a trio of [[Jedi]] apprentices—the [[Padawan]] [[Ahsoka Tano]] and the [[youngling]]s [[Jinx]] and [[O-Mer]], also prey of the Trandoshans.<ref name="Wookiee Hunt">{{TCW|Wookiee Hunt}}</ref>

Chewbacca escaped from the wreckage and followed the trio (with whom he communicated with thanks to Tano's understanding of [[Shyriiwook]]) to their hideout. Using his technical expertise and parts from the crashed transport, he constructed a [[transmitter]] to contact his people on his nearby [[homeworld]]; however, it seemingly failed and an impatient Jinx, supported by O-Mer, decided to lure down and hijack a hunting pod and take the base ship. As persuaded by Tano, Chewbacca joined in their endeavor and raided the Trandoshan base, only to be joined by a Wookiee relief force led by [[General]] [[Tarfful]]—who had received Chewbacca's transmission—as well as [[bounty hunter]]s [[Sugi (bounty hunter)|Sugi]] and [[Seripas]]. Once all the Trandoshans had been killed, Chewbacca and the Wookiees accompanied the young Jedi to the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]] on [[Coruscant]], where they parted ways.<ref name="Wookiee Hunt" />

====Battle of Kashyyyk====
{{Quote|Good-bye, Tarfful. Good-bye, Chewbacca. Miss you I will.|Yoda, shortly before his departure from Kashyyyk|Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith}}
[[File:GreeonKashyyyk.png|thumb|left|275px|Clone Commander Gree, Yoda and Chewbacca on Kashyyyk.]]
During the last days of the war, Chewbacca was a major player in the [[Battle of Kashyyyk]], overseeing the confrontation between the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] and the invading [[Separatist Droid Army]] alongside Tarfful and [[Jedi General]] [[Yoda]], as well as [[Jedi Master]] [[Luminara Unduli]]. Following the implementation of [[Order 66]], Chewbacca and Tarfful witnessed the [[assassin]]ation attempt on Yoda by [[Clone Commander|Commander]] [[CC-1004|Gree]] and his aide; he helped the Jedi [[Grand Master]] elude the [[clone trooper]]s and escape from the planet.<ref name="Episode III" />

===Rise of the Empire===
[[File:Chewbacca caught by slavers.png|thumb|297x297px|right|Chewbacca is enslaved along with several other Wookiees.]]
Following the [[Proclamation of the New Order|reorganization]] of the Republic into the [[Galactic Empire]], Chewbacca saw his people sent to work as [[Slavery|slaves]],<ref name="Smuggler's Run" /> or as [[Mining|miners]] in places such as [[Kessel]],<ref name="rebelsvisual">''[[Star Wars Rebels: The Visual Guide]]''</ref> or made to serve as science experiments.<ref name="Aftermath" /> At some point, Chewbacca and several other Wookiees were captured and enslaved by several Trandoshan slavers.<ref name="Chewie 2">''[[Chewbacca, Part II]]''</ref> Like them, he was forced into slavery, working to cut the [[wroshyr tree]]s in order to feed the [[Imperial Army]].<ref name="Aftermath" /> Chewbacca attempted to escape but was betrayed by a greedy [[Kowakian monkey-lizard]] bounty hunter<ref name="Official Guide" /><ref name="Junior Novel">''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: A Junior Novel]]''</ref> and turned over as a Imperial [[prisoner]] and was sent to the Imperial planet [[Kethmandi]]. There he had the opportunity to escape captivity, but sacrificed his own freedom to save a fellow prisoner.<ref name="Junior Novel" /> During as a prisoner for the Galactic Empire, he was later sent to the Imperial Army on [[Mimban]]. Whilst on Mimban, he came to be referred to as "the Beast".<ref name="DB" /> Chewbacca also learned that the Imperials were trying to sell him off as a pit fighter.<ref name="Expanded Edition">''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: Expanded Edition]]''</ref>

====Meeting Han Solo====
{{Quote|What's your name, anyway?''"<br />«''Chewbacca, son of Attichitcuk.''»<br />"''All right. Well, you’re gonna need a nickname, 'cause I ain't saying that every time.|Han Solo and Chewbacca|Solo: A Star Wars Story: A Junior Novel}}
In [[10 BBY]], after [[Han Solo]] was denounced as a deserter by [[Tobias Beckett]], a criminal impersonating an Imperial officer, his commanding officer decided to execute him by giving him to "the beast". While imprisoned in an underground holding cell, Han used his knowledge of Shyriiwook to convince Chewbacca to stage a fight with him after realizing that one of the supports in the cell was weak, and that destroying it would allow them to escape [[Prison|imprisonment]]. Following their escape, the pair managed to join a reluctant [[Beckett's gang|gang]].<ref name="Solo" /> Chewbacca, grateful for Solo's intervention, proclaimed a [[life debt]] to the outlaw. Chewbacca thereby became Solo's lifelong friend.<ref name="Absolutely Everything">''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know]]''</ref>

====Meeting Lando Calrissian====
[[File:Conveyex Aurebesh.jpg|thumb|left|290x290px|Chewbacca with Han Solo aboard the Conveyex [[train]].]]
Chewbacca and Han began their outlaw lives working as part of pirate Tobias Beckett’s crew. The group were hired by [[Crimson Dawn]] to steal a train car of refined [[coaxium]] on [[Vandor]]. However, they failed due to the intervention of [[Enfys Nest]] and the [[Cloud-Riders]], and Solo's decision to drop the cargo. Solo and Chewbacca promised [[Dryden Vos]] of Crimson Dawn an equivalent shipment that they would obtain unrefined by making the notorious [[Kessel Run]]. Vos sent [[Qi'ra]], who had become his top lieutenant, with them.<ref name="Solo" />

Knowing they would need a fast ship to transport the coaxium before it degraded and exploded, Qi'ra introduced the pair to [[Lando Calrissian]]. Solo played Calrissian in a game of "[[Corellian Spike]]" [[sabacc]], with the stakes being Calrissian's [[YT-1300 light freighter]], the [[Millennium Falcon]]. Solo lost the game, regardless, Calrissian agreed to personally pilot the Falcon for the job in return for a cut of the profits.

====The Kessel Run====
Chewbacca, Solo, Qi’ra, Calrissian, and Beckett stole the unrefined coaxium from Kessel during a slave riot instigated by Calrissian’s navigational droid, [[L3-37]]. During the escape, Solo flew the ''Falcon'', with Chewbacca as his copilot, for the first of many times. Because the crew stole the coaxium [[fuel]] as unrefined, it was necessary to make the escape from Kessel to the refinery on [[Savareen]] in record time, prompting Solo to plot a shorter, and much more dangerous course through the maelstrom that surrounded Kessel and near a gravity well called [[the Maw]], reducing the typical distance required from 20 to 12 parsecs.<ref name="Solo" />

====Savareen====
[[File:Beckett and Chewie.png|thumb|right|275x275px|Beckett takes Chewbacca captive.]]
Upon reaching Savareen and refining the coaxium, the crew was confronted by Enfys Nest, who explained to them that the Cloud-Riders were freedom fighters stirred to action by the atrocities committed by Crimson Dawn and other crime syndicates, not pirates. Solo devised a plan to give the coaxium to the Cloud-Riders and give Vos fake coaxium, but Vos was prepared for their betrayal because of information given to him by his double-agent in the crew, Beckett.<ref name="Solo" />

However, Solo had double-crossed Beckett and Vos: the containers he left with the Cloud-Raiders were empty, and Nest dispatched the agents Vos sent to retrieve it. The coaxium Solo, Qi'ra, and Chewbacca brought to Vos was, in fact, genuine. Beckett managed to escape

with the coaxium and Chewbacca as a hostage. After Qi'ra betrayed and killed Vos, Solo found and killed Beckett, but could only watch as he and Chewbacca were left left him behind, while Qi'ra left Savareen in Vos' [[First Light|yacht]] to meet Crimson Dawn leader [[Maul|Darth Maul]]. Solo and Chewbacca entrusted the coaxium to Nest, who intended to use it to form a rebellion against the Empire.<ref name="Solo" />

====The ''Falcon''====
[[File:Winners of the Falcon.jpeg|thumb|left|323x323px|Chewbacca and Han in their newly ''Millennium Falcon''.]]
Solo and Chewbacca tracked down Calrissian to [[Numidian Prime]]. Solo swiped the spare cards Lando held up his sleeve, and challenged him to a rematch of sabaac for the ''Falcon'', a game which Solo won fairly.<ref name="Solo" /> The ''Falcon'' instantly became Solo's most prized possession. With their new-found ship and confidence, Solo and Chewbacca began engaging in much more dangerous and risky criminal operations, eventually becoming smugglers.<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars">''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''</ref> Around the same time, Chewbacca likewise hung a pair of [[chance cube]] dice above the freighter's piloting console.<ref name="Smuggler's Run" />

====The Cordaxian Sea====
At one point, Han Solo and Chewbacca were transporting two tons of Cordaxian ore on Odona, with the help of [[Flax]], a [[Kajain'sa'Nikto]]. They were being pursued by the Empire, and Flax, who was worried about being put in an Imperial prison, pulled a blaster on Han. Chewbacca did a barrel roll with the ''Millenium Falcon'', knocking Flax out of the ship entirely. They successfully escaped the Empire and Odona, but they left Flax behind.<ref name="Annual 3">''[[Star Wars Annual 3]]''</ref>

====Bounty hunted====
=====Dropping Jabba's cargo=====
Solo and Chewbacca were later smuggling some Imperial cargo for [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the [[Hutt]] when they were stopped by an Imperial [[blockade]]. They started being chased by several TIE fighters, and they were faced with a choice: surrender, or drop the Imperial cargo. Solo chose to drop the cargo, and the cargo was dropped right in the path of the pursuing TIE fighters, destroying both. Without being pursued, Solo and Chewbacca flew down to the nearby [[Unidentified planet (Han Solo)|planet]], the ''Falcon'' heavily damaged.<ref name="Choose Your Destiny">''[[Choose Your Destiny: A Han & Chewie Adventure]]''</ref>

=====Making repairs=====
Once landing, they began making repairs, until they found out that the planet was inhabited by the [[crime lord]] [[Rekias Nodo|Nodo]]. Nodo and his crew ran a [[Nodo's shipyard|chop shop]] for stolen ships, and Nodo also had dozens of prisoners, including [[Meecha Odon]]. Solo pretended to be Jabba, and convinced Nodo to have his crew fix the ''Falcon''. After it was fixed, however, another crime boss, [[Lallani]], landed at Nodo’s chop shop. Lallani had heard Jabba was there, and wanted to capture him.<ref name="Choose Your Destiny" />

=====Freeing the prisoners=====
A battle broke loose, and in the chaos, Solo and Chewbacca freed Odon and the other prisoners. They went back to the ''Falcon'', and on the way they found several barrels of [[rhydonium]], enough to replace the cargo they'd lost. However, Chewbacca convinced Solo that Odon and the prisoners needed the fuel more, and Solo relented. They gave up the fuel they desperately needed, so that Odon could use the fuel to pay for her and the other prisoners’ way home.<ref name="Choose Your Destiny" />

=====Versus the Mist Hunter=====
[[File:Chewie vs Zuckuss.jpg|thumb|right|Chewbacca fighting Zuckuss]]
As they were unloading the rhydonium from the ''Falcon'' at [[Valtos space port]], [[Zuckuss]] and [[4-LOM]] attacked them. They revealed that Han and Chewie had a bounty on their head, put there by Nodo himself. Zuckuss managed to put Han into the ''[[Mist Hunter]]'s'' hold, but Chewbacca attacked Zuckuss in order to rescue Solo and [[Beris Ford]], Zuckuss's other prisoner, from the bounty hunters. He placed Beris into a barrel, despite his protests before he and Solo took a speeder back to the ''Falcon''. However, Zuckuss and 4-LOM caught up with, but Chewbacca and Solo were able to use several barrels to knock them down. As they flew ''Falcon'' away from [[Valtos]], Chewbacca and Solo ejected Beris' barrel into space with a homing beacon to notify his family. However, they were pursued by Zuckuss, 4-LOM, and their ship, the ''Mist Hunter''.<ref name="FCBD 2018">{{IDWAdventuresCite|Free Comic Book Day 2018|Hunter vs Hunted}}</ref>

Chewbacca manned one of the ''Falcon''<nowiki/>'s [[AG-2G quad laser cannon|laser cannons]] to fight off the ''Mist Hunter''. Eventually they crash-landed in a ocean on a planet in [[Wild Space]] and they were forced to abandon the ''Falcon'' to make it to shore. After the ''Mist Hunter'' crashed, Chewbacca and Han then Zuckuss behind. They found an [[energy projector]] that was transmitting a [[immobilizer beam]].<ref name="Powered Down 1">{{IDWAdventuresCite|10|[[Powered Down, Part I]]}}</ref>

=====Working together=====
Solo and Chewbacca climbed the projector, but were confronted by Zuckuss who tossed spears at them. When Chewbacca go to the top, he was able to turn off the beam by destroying it's power source. However, small droids were activated and wanted to destroy them and all organic life in the galaxy.<ref name="Powered Down 1" />

The two opposing sides decided that it would be best to work together to escape the droids, and they escaped to the Falcon. Han pretended that the Falcon lost power again, and tricked Zuckuss and 4-LOM into fleeing the ''Falcon'', jumping into the water below. Solo and Chewbacca left the planet, leaving the two bounty hunters behind.<ref name="Adventures 11">{{IDWAdventuresCite|11|[[Powered Down, Part II]]}}</ref>

====Mission to Ushruu====
=====False pretenses=====
At one point, while on Coruscant after a smuggling job, Chewbacca and Solo were approached by [[Alinka Aloo]], the daughter of [[Sim Aloo]]. Aloo, wanted to hire them for a job, and requested that they go to her [[Alinka Aloo's tower|tower]]. A [[Standard week|week]] later, they went to see her, and she told them that she had a [[tooka]]-sitting job for Chewbacca, and Solo was to remain with her. They reluctantly accepted, and Chewbacca went on a cargo ship with the [[librarian]] [[Mayvlin Trillick]]. But the ship, on [[autopilot]], pulled them into [[hyperspace]]. During the unwilling flight, Chewbacca and Trillick were told by Aloo that the real job was to steal an unknown artifact from a temple on the planet [[Ushruu]]. Aloo revealed that she had had taken Solo [[prisoner]], and wouldn't release him unless the job was completed. With no choice but to continue, Chewbaccca continued the job, along with Trillick. Before the ship reached Ushruu, the two bonded, as Trillick told Chewbacca about how her planet had been ravaged by the Empire, and she was also being blackmailed by Aloo, who had one of her peoples' sacred texts. The two dealt with the tookas and the cargo ship's cargo droid, K-2SB, who was actually [[K-2SO]] on an undercover mission for [[Cassian Jeron Andor|Cassian Andor]]. Eventually, the ship pulled out of hyperspace.<ref name="Mighty Chewbacca">''[[The Mighty Chewbacca in the Forest of Fear!]]''</ref>

=====Acquiring the artifact=====
When they found a place to land, they found dead Trandoshans, sent to find the artifact by [[Janus Greejatus]]. Trillick and Chewbacca proceeded to travel towards the location of the temple, bringing K-2SO along. Trillick had filled an [[antigrav crate]] with supplies, including a [[Medpac|medkit]], and forced K-2 to carry it. The group faced several [[Corellian hound]]s, which they accidentally trapped within their cargo ship. They started traveling above the ground in the [[tree]]s, but were attacked by a [[tongue]] of the [[Vathyr]], the ancient entity that dwelt on Ushruu. It dragged Trillick to the Vathyr itself, but Chewbacca managed to free her. Eventually, they reached the temple, and searched it. They found the artifact, which was an ancient [[book]] of [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]] teachings, in the temple's library. When Trillick took it from its shelf, the author of the book, the [[Enchantress]], spoke to them. The Enchantress's voice asked who the book was for, and seemed satisfied when she was told it was for [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]].<ref name="Mighty Chewbacca" />

=====Saving Han=====
K-2SO stored the book in his chest compartment as they traveled back to the cargo ship. But when they reached the ship, Andor had arrived. Cassian and K-2 flew away with the book, which Chewbacca and Trillick needed to rescue Solo and the ancient text. Chewbacca came up with a plan, and he and Trillick flew back to Coruscant. They arrived at Alinka's tower, and set free the Corellian [[Dog|hounds]] that were trapped in the ship's cargo hold free. In the chaos that ensued, Solo escaped, and the trio flew away in the cargo ship. They went back to the ''Falcon'', and fought many [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighters]] to escape Coruscant. Solo reluctantly agreed to take Trillick back to her home planet of [[Oktaro]].<ref name="Mighty Chewbacca" />

===Galactic Civil War===
====Death Star rescue====
{{Quotetrans|It's okay to care about them. They need our help.|Chewbacca, to Han Solo|A New Hope: The Princess, the Scoundrel, and the Farm Boy}}
[[File:Charter negotiations.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Chewbacca and Solo negotiate passage fees with Kenobi and Skywalker in Chalmun's Cantina.]]
During one of their smuggling attempts at the time of the Galactic Civil War, the ''Millennium Falcon'' was boarded and the two lost the cargo that they were hauling for their usual employer, Jabba the Hutt. Arriving at [[Mos Eisley]] on [[Tatooine]] to speak with Jabba about the lost cargo, they sat down in [[Chalmun's Cantina]]. At the bar, Chewbacca was approached by [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Ben Kenobi]], who was searching for passage for himself, [[Luke Skywalker]] and the [[droid]]s [[R2-D2]] and [[C-3PO]] to [[Alderaan]]. Promised 2,000 [[credit]]s in advance and an additional 15,000 upon arrival to Alderaan, Solo and Chewbacca agreed to the commission, escaping from Imperial vessels as they left Tatooine.<ref name="Episode IV" />

During the hyperspace journey, while Kenobi [[Jedi training|trained]] Skywalker in the use of [[the Force]], Chewbacca played a game of [[dejarik]] with R2-D2, who made a move that Chewbacca disliked. C-3PO advised that the move was technically fair, and even chided Chewbacca, at which point Solo advised them not to anger the Wookiee because of his species' tendency to pull arms out of their sockets, promting the two droids to surrender.<ref name="Episode IV" />

[[File:Into the garbage chute flyboy.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Chewbacca, Solo and Organa, shortly before they jump into a garbage chute.]]
Upon the ''Falcon''{{'s}} exit from hyperspace, the group found themselves in a [[Asteroid|meteor]] storm produced by the [[the Disaster|destruction]] of the planet by the Imperial [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]] [[superweapon]]. The group were soon caught by the [[tractor beam]] of the battle station which was still looming in the system, but managed to evade capture by hiding in the ''Falcon''{{'s}} smuggling compartments. While Kenobi set out to disable the station's tractor beam in order to allow them to escape, Skywalker was told by R2-D2 that [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Organa]] was being held in [[Detention Block AA-23]], her [[Death|execution]] scheduled. They set out to [[Rescue of Princess Leia|rescue]] her, with Chewbacca posing as a prisoner of [[stormtrooper]]-disguised Skywalker and Solo. Despite encountering trouble, Chewbacca and the others managed to escape from the Death Star—except for Kenobi, who had died in a duel with [[Darth]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Vader]]. The ''Falcon'' soon arrived to [[Yavin 4]], landing on [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebellion's]] [[Great Temple (Yavin 4)|secret base]], just as the Death Star closed in on the [[moon]].<ref name="Episode IV" />

====Yavin 4====
{{Quote|What're you looking at? I know what I'm doing.|Han Solo to Chewbacca|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}
Skywalker was hopeful that Chewbacca and Solo would join the Rebellion, but Solo was more concerned with receiving his payment in order to pay his debt to Jabba. Though Chewbacca growled in dissatisfaction at this course of action, the two departed, seemingly leaving the Rebel Alliance on its own to deal with the Death Star. They would return just in time to protect Skywalker during the Battle of Yavin from Vader's [[TIE Advanced x1]], allowing the young pilot to destroy the massive [[battle station]] by firing a [[proton torpedo]] into its exhaust port.<ref name="Episode IV" />

Back on Yavin 4, Luke Skywalker and Han Solo were both awarded [[Medal of Bravery|medals]] by Organa, while Chewbacca howled in delight during the [[Royal Award Ceremony|ceremony]].<ref name="Episode IV" /> The time for celebration was soon over, for Organa asked the Rebels to take a moment of silence to honor and remember all those who had died when Alderaan was destroyed, whereas General [[Jan Dodonna|Dodonna]] announced their need to [[Evacuation of Yavin 4|evacuate]] Yavin since the Empire was aware of their location.<ref name="PL1">''[[Princess Leia, Part I]]''</ref> Chewbacca would be also awarded a medal,<ref name="Smuggler's Run" /><ref name="anh-PSFB" /> and shared a moment of banter between Organa and Solo, just before they parted ways.<ref name="PL1" />

====Cyrkon====
{{Quote|You two play fast and loose.''"<br />"''It's worked so far.|Caluan Ematt, on Chewbacca and Han Solo's tactics|Smuggler's Run: A Han Solo & Chewbacca Adventure}}
However, before they could depart for Tatooine to pay Jabba, Organa would ask Solo to run an errand for the Rebellion, which Chewbacca convinced him to accept—to rescue [[Lieutenant]] [[Caluan Ematt]] from [[Cyrkon]]. On the ''Falcon'', the two made their way to the planet, only to find themselves confronted by the ''[[Vehement]]'', which they avoided with a false [[Identification Friend or Foe transponder|IFF transponder]], and landed in [[Motok]]. There, they were immediately attacked by [[Captivator's crew|some]] of Jabba's bounty hunters, including [[Captivator (droid)|Captivator]], which prompted Solo to accuse them of being "Rebels" and set them against [[Imperial Security Bureau|ISB]] [[Commander]] [[Alecia Beck]]'s garrison.<ref name="Smuggler's Run" />

Chewbacca slipped away with Solo to the ''[[Serendipity|Miss Fortune]]'' [[cantina]], where they found their old friend [[Delia Leighton]], to whom they asked about Ematt's location. After she told them their destination and the password, Chewbacca and Solo rented a [[V-40]] and went into a [[hotel]], where they met Ematt, but were attacked by the bounty hunters again, as Leighton had revealed their location to save [[Curtis]]'s life. However, they escaped and made their way to the ''Falcon'', only to be ambushed by Beck and more than forty stoormtroopers.<ref name="Smuggler's Run" />

[[File:Beck_apprehends_Solo.png|thumb|right|300px|Chewbacca, Solo and Ematt confronted by Alecia Beck.]]
Forced to surrender, Chewbacca, Solo and Ematt were taken into custody, with Beck focusing on Ematt and leaving Chewbacca and Solo to the stormtroopers. Unbeknownst to the Imperials, Solo noticed the ''Miss Fortune'' making their way to save them, but with the [[magnetic field]] activated, it would be pointless. Once aware of Solo's intentions, Chewbacca pretended to be angry at Solo and shoved him, sending him flying into a trooper to grab his [[E-11 blaster rifle]] and destroy the field generators, flooding the [[hangar]] with Cyrkon's toxic gases. Soon enough, the ''Miss Fortune'' opened fire at the Imperials, and Chewbacca made his way to the ''Falcon'' to start the [[engine]]s while Solo helped Ematt and recovered their weapons.<ref name="Smuggler's Run" />

Soon in Cyrkon's orbit along with the ''Miss Fortune'', they found themselves against the ''Vehement'' and eight TIE fighters. They engaged the [[starfighter]]s, defeating several of them, until the ''Miss Fortune''{{'s}} took a hit that damaged its navicomputer; Chewbacca saw Solo's nobler side when he decided to cover the [[1550-LEX space yacht]] to make a run for Cyrkon's atmosphere just as the ''Vehement''{{'s}} tractor beam advanced towards them. They resisted the beam by entering the planet's [[atmosphere]] themselves, while Leighton fled, and approached Motok in a dead-engine glide, daring Beck into catching the ''Falcon'' at the price of destroying the city with the tractor beam and turning Cyrkon against the Empire. As she desisted, the ''Falcon'' began its fall to the ground and the two pilots manually restarted the engines, just in time to avoid crashing into the city and escape.<ref name="Smuggler's Run" />

====Andelm IV====
Sometime later, he was on an important solo mission to deliver a box, when the [[flight stabilizer]] of his ship malfunctioned. Forced to crash-land on [[Andelm IV]], Chewbacca went to a city to obtain a replacement and engaged a [[Besalisk]] vendor. Their deal was interrupted by a fugitive young girl, [[Zarro]], who tried to sell her stolen [[speeder bike]]. The Besalisk, however, refused and tried to betray her to the planet's crime lord, [[Jaum]]. Chewbacca stopped him, though, by having the Besalisk sell him the stabilizer. However, he did not have enough credits to buy it. Subsequently, he went to a cantina and played sabacc, successfully doubling his credits. Chewbacca then noticed the girl from before, and helped her hide from Jaum's men.<ref name="Chewie 1">''[[Chewbacca, Part I]]''</ref>

Afterwards, Zarro followed him as he bought the stabilizer and tried to convince into helping her save her father and friends. Unable to delay his mission, Chewbacca repaired his ship, and changed his mind to leave the planet when Zarro mentioned her people had been enslaved by Jaum. Unknown to Chewie and Zarro, Jaum was planning to export the [[Andelm beetle]] larvae to the Empire to be processed into [[Dedlanite]], a substance used in the manufacture of [[blaster]]s.<ref name="Chewie 1" /> To maximise profits, Jaum also planned to sell his slave workforce to the Empire.<ref name="Chewie 2" />

The following day, Zarro devised a plan to infiltrate Jaum's [[Andelm beetle caverns|mine]]. She got Chewbacca to search for an open air vent for the slave [[miner]]s to escape. Meanwhile, Zarro infiltrated the mine by allowing herself to be recaptured. Her plan was to locate a hollowed part of the mine. Keeping in touch by transmitter, Zarro told Chewie to find an open air vent. While struggling through the tunnel, the Wookiee was haunted by memories of his enslavement at the hands of the Trandoshans. Zarro's escape plan encountered a problem when she was caught by Jaum and his men. After the miners including Zarro's father [[Arrax (Zarro's father)|Arrax]] objected to Jaum's plan, the gangster ordered his men to execute the miners.<ref name="Chewie 2" />

Before Jaum's guards could carry out their execution, Chewie snuck up behind them and overpowered them with his [[bowcaster]]. After meeting Zarro's father, Chewie joined forces with the miners to fight their way out of the mine. He refashioned a rod from a broken-down [[GNK-series power droid]] and used it to disable a [[Jaum's wheeled battle droid|wheeled battle droid]]. Shortly later, the Wookiee knocked out one of Jaum's henchmen with the derelict GNK power droid. Chewie eventually found his way to the mine's loading bay, which was full of crates of Andelm beetle larvae. However, Jaum's [[Shistavanen]] enforcer [[Tyvak]] fired on the incendiary larvae with his blaster, igniting an explosion that created a cave-in.<ref name="Chewie 2" />

Despite Tyvak's efforts, Chewie and his friends managed to survive the explosion. Part of the Wookiee's left leg was scorched by fire but Zarro managed to douse it. Chewie and his friends then narrowly escaped a swarm of Andelm beetles. Chewie managed to used his bowcaster to collapse a girder, temporarily delaying the swarm but denying the miners their only way out in the process. While heading to regroup with the other miners in a different section of the mine, Chewie encountered the guard he had knocked out with the GNK power droid. Upon recognizing the guard, he dropped the heavy droid chassis on the man, leaving him behind.<ref name="Chewie 3">''[[Chewbacca, Part III]]''</ref>

While the miners discussed a way of digging themselves out of the mine, Chewie came up with the idea of climbing out vertically through a sinkhole. While skeptical of the Wookiee's chance of success, the miners and Zarro agreed to support his plan. With much effort, Chewie managed to climb through the roots of a dead tree and topple it, creating a pit large enough for all the miners to climb up. Chewie then lowered a rope for all the miners to evacuate. Once everyone had reached the surface, Chewie and Zarro departed under the pretext of repairing his A-wing starfighter.<ref name="Chewie 3" />

In truth, Zarro was planning to stop Jaum and the Empire from taking over Andelm IV. Enlisting Chewie's support, they traveled to the planet's [[Andelm IV spaceport|spaceport]]. There, they found a bunker that was inhabited by her blind friend [[Sevox]] and his [[protocol droid]] [[I-7]], who served as the "eyes" of the former. After examining Sevox's junkshop, Chewbacca came up with a plan to sabotage Jaum's plot to export Dedlanite to the Empire.<ref name="Chewie 3" /> this plan involved fitting a decrepit [[R5 unit|R5 repair droid]] with explosives. Sevox thought Chewie and Zarro's plan had little chance of success but nonetheless agreed to drop them off at the spaceport. He also offered his bunker as a hiding place for Zarro and her friend.<ref name="Chewie 4">''[[Chewbacca, Part IV]]''</ref>

After shooing away a group of child beggars, Chewie and Jaum infiltrated the spaceport disguised as Jaum's new [[battle droid|war droid]] and a hooded [[alien]]. They soon discovered that the spaceport was being occupied by several stormtroopers, [[Scout trooper]]s, and an [[All Terrain Scout Transport|AT-ST walker]]. Shortly later, they found Jaum supervising several stormtroopers who were loading crates of dedlanite into an [[Sentinel-class landing craft|Imperial landing craft]]. When Jaum demanded that Zarro take off her helmet, Chewie opened fire on the gangster and his stormtroopers. After running out of ammunition, he took out the stormtroopers in hand to hand combat.<ref name="Chewie 4" />

While Chewie exchanged fire with Jaum, Zarro managed to bring the rigged R5 droid "[[Boomer (astromech droid)|Boomer]]" aboard the shuttle. Chewie then fought with Tyvak but was trapped by the AT-ST walker. The Wookiee however activated a nearby engine which burned Tyvak alive and knocked out the Imperial walker's right cannon, causing it to topple to the ground. Meanwhile, Jaum managed to escape aboard the landing craft with the dedlanite and "Boomer." The two were overjoyed their plot had succeeded. However, their elation was short-lived and they were soon arrested by scout troopers reporting to the Imperial Commander [[Kai (Imperial)|Kai]], the same officer who was interested in Jaum's dedlanite deal.<ref name="Chewie 4" />

Per Commander Kai's orders, Chewie and Zarro were transported up to Kai's [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|Imperial Star Destroyer]] in orbit above Andelm IV. On the way up, Chewie and Zarro managed to overpower their stormtrooper captors aboard the [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle|Imperial shuttle]]. After landing, Chewie knocked out an Imperial [[RA-7 protocol droid]] that Kai had sent to negotiate their surrender. After knocking out the remaining stormtroopers clinging to his body, Kai agreed to listen to Zarro.<ref name="Chewie 5">''[[Chewbacca, Part V]]''</ref>

Zarro made up a story that Jaum was a fraudster who had come to scam Kai. She also claimed that he was a rebel [[spy]] and that he did not have a mining operation. To back up her story, Zarro told him that Jaum's "droid" "Boomer" was rigged with explosives. Shortly later, Jaum arrived carrying samples of dedlanite. Shortly later, Boomer exploded, destroying the landing craft and damaging the Star Destroyer's force-field. In the meantime, Chewie and Zarro managed to escape on a [[TIE/sa bomber]]. Despite Zarro accidentally activating a [[thermal detonator]] which destroyed the ship's left-wing, they managed to crash-land the bomber on Andelm IV.<ref name="Chewie 5" />

While Chewie turned down Zarro's request to stay behind with her people, he still gave her a hug and awarded her a gold medallion he had received for his services during the [[Battle of Yavin]]. After departing as friends, Chewie traveled on his A-wing to his homeworld of Kashyyyk. There, he returned to his village for a family reunion and awarded his child a bandolier. Shortly later, Chewie departed aboard the ''Millennium Falcon''. Meanwhile, Jaum was imprisoned by Commander Kai, who was disgusted by Jaum's greed and his alleged scam. He had the gangster tortured by his [[IT-O Interrogator]].<ref name="Chewie 5" />

====Cymoon 1====
{{Quote|Chewie, stand down! Do not fire! You take a shot at Darth Vader and the whole factory will be on alert!''"<br />"''Are you crazy? Chewbacca if you have a shot at Vader I order you to take it! Forget about us! Killing him is more important! Do you hear me Chewie? Take the shot! Now!|Han Solo and Princess Leia Organa|Star Wars 1: Skywalker Strikes}}
[[File:Chewie watches over the team.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Chewbacca watches the team from the vantage point.]]
Chewbacca took part in an [[Attack on Cymoon 1|assault]] on [[Weapons Factory Alpha]], on the moon [[Cymoon 1]], alongside the usual team—Solo, Organa, Skywalker, C-3PO and R2-D2—, with Solo posing as the envoy of Jabba the Hutt to enter the factory, Skywalker and Organa disguised as his bodyguards, along with R2-D2. Separately, Chewbacca and C-3PO landed the ''Falcon'' in the [[Cymoon 1 refuse fields|refuse fields]] surrounding the factory, with the latter going to a vantage point to observe through the scope of his [[sniper rifle]] how Solo engaged [[Overseer (Assignment)|Overseer]] [[Aggadeen]] and entered the facilities.<ref name="SW1" />

Unexpectedly, though, Darth Vader arrived on a ''Lambda''-class T-4a shuttle, and Chewbacca contacted Solo, telling him to stand down, for firing on the Sith Lord would put the entire moon on alert, but Organa gave the order to take the shot. Chewbacca consented and fired, but Vader sensed danger and deflected the first shot with his lightsaber. He continued shooting, but the [[Sith Lord]] had lifted two stormtroopers into the air using the Force and used them as human shields, only for him to topple the building Chewbacca was perched upon. Though it collapsed, the Wookiee escaped from the wreckage. Now being hunted down, Chewbacca lost contact with the team as he made his way to the ''Falcon''.<ref name="SW1" />

[[File:chewie wookiee rage.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Chewbacca unleashes his rage against the intruding aliens.]]
When he arrived, he discovered C-3PO in pieces strapped and the freighter being dismantled by [[Unidentified Cymoon 1 species|tentacled aliens]]. Angered, Chewbacca chased the scavenger away, recovered the protocol droid and made contact with Solo, who along Organa had hijacked an [[All Terrain Armored Transport|AT-AT]] and were escaping from Vader. Despite the lengthy time he needed to fix the ship, Chewbacca repaired enough of the ''Falcon''{{'s}} damage to pilot it to the team's position, where he extracted them and many of the slaves Skywalker had freed. As they began their retreat from Cymoon 1, Organa took over the controls instead of a delirious Solo, so that Chewbacca could repair the hyperdrive, which he managed to do, so that Organa could make the jump into [[lightspeed]] and escape a blockade of Star Destroyers.<ref name="SW3">''[[Star Wars 3: Skywalker Strikes, Part III]]''</ref>

====Nar Shaddaa====
Within two days, the ''Millennium Falcon'' rendezvoused with the [[Alliance Fleet]], where Solo was treated for his injuries and Chewbacca and Solo went on to better repair the ''Falcon'' on an Alliance [[EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate|Nebulon-B frigate]], when the Corellian noted that it had been a miracle that the ship had flown with Chewbacca's rushed repairs, prompting an annoyed reply from the Wookiee, while they strived to repair the ''Falcon''.<ref name="SW4">''[[Star Wars 4: Skywalker Strikes, Part IV]]''</ref>

The need for new parts prompted Solo to go on a mission with Organa, leaving Chewbacca behind with the freighter.<ref name="SW5">''[[Star Wars 5: Skywalker Strikes, Part V]]''</ref> However, when he heard that Skywalker had been captured by [[Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi|Grakkus]] the Hutt on [[Nar Shaddaa]], he volunteered for the rescue mission before [[Chancellor (Rebel Alliance)|Chancellor]] [[Mon Mothma]], and Generals Dodonna and [[Gial Ackbar]] of the [[Alliance High Command]]. Taking C-3PO with him,<ref name="SW9">''[[Star Wars 9: Showdown on the Smuggler's Moon, Part II]]''</ref> Chewbacca took the ''Falcon'' to the moon, wherein the droid did the talking, and the Wookiee used more violent means to interrogate the criminals in search of Skywalker. It would be a [[Zabrak]] [[bartender]] who told them of Skywalker's location on Grakkus's palace and his direction, and Chewbacca and C-3PO set out to Skywalker's encounter.<ref name="SW10">''[[Star Wars 10: Showdown on the Smuggler's Moon, Part III]]''</ref> Just as Chewbacca and C-3PO were planning to break into Grakkus's palace, they were attacked by Dengar. Chewbacca fought Dengar until Solo and Organa arrived, and Han shot Dengar in the back.<ref name="SW11">''[[Star Wars 11: Showdown on the Smuggler's Moon, Part IV]]''</ref> With Dengar distracted by Han, Chewbacca used the opportunity to throw Dengar off the building. Chewbacca, Han, and Leia then went to save Luke from Grakkus, only to find several stormtroopers in the way. Luckily, R2-D2 had acquired a few lightsabers from Grakkus, and they used them to fight the enemies. After that, they fled from Nar Shaddaa.<ref name="SW12">''[[Star Wars 12: Showdown on the Smuggler's Moon, Part V]]''</ref>

====Vrogas Vas====
Later, when Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader crash-landed on [[Vrogas Vas]], Organa approached Solo and Chewbacca for help in defeating Vader and saving Luke.<<ref name="Vader Down">''[[Vader Down, Part I]]''</ref> While Han Solo faced off against Doctor [[Chelli Lona Aphra|Chelli Aphra]], Chewbacca ripped the arms off of [[0-0-0|Triple-0]], a homicidal protocol droid. But Triple-0 managed to inject a lethal dose of [[Mandalorian Xenotoxin]] into Chewbacca, leveling the playing field. But before Triple-0 could kill Chewbacca, Luke came to the rescue, further damaging Triple-0. Chewbacca, Luke, Han Solo, and R2-D2 then all fled from [[BT-1]], a homicidal astromech droid.<ref name="SW13">''[[Star Wars 13: Vader Down, Part III]]''</ref> As they all went to save Leia from Darth Vader, they were attacked by [[Black Krrsantan]], who was working alongside Doctor Aphra. Even though he was feeling the effects of Triple-0's poison, Chewbacca started fighting Krrsantan.<ref name="Vader 14">''[[Darth Vader 14: Vader Down, Part IV]]''</ref> Chewbacca was initially losing the fight, but when R2-D2 injected him with the antidote to the poison, Chewbacca started winning the fight.<ref name="SW14">''[[Star Wars 14: Vader Down, Part V]]''</ref> However, Krrsantan was defeated when he attacked C-3PO, who electrocuted Krrsantan. When they returned to the Falcon, they were able to capture Aphra.<ref name="Vader 15">''[[Darth Vader 15: Vader Down, Part VI]]''</ref>

====The ''Harbinger''====
Later, Chewbacca assisted the rebellion in commandeering the [[Star Destroyer]] ''[[Harbinger (Imperial I-class)|Harbinger]]''.<ref name="SW22">''[[Star Wars 22: The Last Flight of the Harbinger, Part II]]''</ref> Chewbacca jettisoned the ship's reactor just before it exploded, creating the illusion that the ship was destroyed. He, along with many other Rebels, worked on keeping the ship afloat while flying it towards [[Tureen VII]].<ref name="SW23">''[[Star Wars 23: The Last Flight of the Harbinger, Part III]]''</ref> When [[Task Force 99]] infiltrated the Harbinger to stop them from attacking Tureen VII, Chewbacca fought one of the elite stormtroopers, [[Zuke]].<ref>[[Star Wars 24: The Last Flight of the Harbinger, Part IV]]</ref> Since the fight took place in the engine room, Chewbacca was able to throw Zuke into the engine's machinery, which conveniently brought the engine back to full power. When the Rebels broke the Imperial siege above Tureen VII, they all fled except for C-3PO, who was captured by SCAR Squadron.<ref name="SW25">''[[Star Wars 25: The Last Flight of the Harbinger, Part V]]''</ref>

====Skorii-Lei====
At some point, Organa was nearly captured by the Empire when transporting important information on Skorii-Lei. She escaped with the help of Pash Davane, an inhabitant of the planet. Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Chewbacca helped the two escape the planet in the Millenium Falcon.<ref name="Annual 2">''[[Star Wars Annual 2]]''</ref>

====The Screaming Citadel====
When Luke Skywalker left with Chelli Aphra for the Screaming Citadel, and Han Solo, Leia Organa, and Sana Starros were preparing to go rescue him, Chewbacca attempted to go with them, but wasn't allowed, because the people of Ktath'atn were extremely hostile towards Wookiees.<ref name="SW31">''[[Star Wars 31: The Screaming Citadel, Part II]]''</ref>

====The Hutt Run====
Later, Han Solo was asked by Mon Mothma to transport Grakkus the Hutt to a Rebel prison in the catacombs of Akiva. During the trip, Han and Chewbacca were attacked by several TIE fighters. Chewbacca manned the ''Millenium Falcon''<nowiki/>'s turret while Han flew, but they had to give up and land on a nearby asteroid, since the ''Falcon''<nowiki/>'s hyperdrive was damaged. Grakkus killed the stormtroopers that boarded the ship, and then attacked Han, but in doing so, let information regarding the planet [[Teth]] slip out. Han electrocuted Grakkus, and they continued on to Akiva.<ref name="SW35">''[[Star Wars 35: The Hutt Run]]''</ref>

====Odona====
At one point, Han Solo and Leia Organa were on Odona looking for a new spot for a Rebel base. They were attacked by [[Frax]], and Leia was grazed by a blaster bolt. Chewbacca helped her into the Falcon, and they fled.<ref name="Annual 3" />

====Hoth====
{{Quote|Laugh it up, fuzzball!|Han Solo, in response to Chewbacca laughing at him|audio=Fuzzball.ogg|Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}
[[File:Chewbacca_captured_by_a_wampa.png|thumb|275px|left|Chewbacca captured by a wampa.]]
Now full-fledged members of the Rebel Alliance, and following a dangerous run-in with bounty hunter on [[Ord Mantell]], Chewbacca accompanied Solo to [[Hoth]], for they had been assigned to the newly-established [[Echo Base]], where Chewbacca would be effecting repairs on the ''Millennium Falcon'' to pay their debt to Jabba once and for all.<ref name="Episode V">[[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']]</ref>

While at Echo Base, Chewbacca was assigned to digging corridors by Organa. On one of these assignments, Chewbacca dug into a cave occupied by a [[wampa]]. The beast captured him and held him hostage. After not checking in, Leia and Artoo started looking for him. They found a scared Chewbacca clutched in the hands of the sleeping wampa. Organa's attempted rescue of Chewbacca ended with the wampa waking up. The wookiee ran to repair the door, which led to the uncovered cave with Artoo, while Leia acted as a distraction. At the last minute, Chewbacca finished his job on the door, and with Organa back inside, he closed it and trapped the woken beast in the cave.<ref name="Beasts of Echo Base">{{FOD|Beasts of Echo Base}}</ref>

[[File:AbominableChewbacca-SWT.png|thumb|200px|right|Chewbacca while on Hoth.]]
Chewbacca's repairs on the ''Falcon'' were when Solo had to venture outside during Hoth's night to rescue Skywalker. Soon afterwards, Chewbacca and Solo destroyed an [[Viper probe droid|Imperial probe droid]], but could not prevent it from transmitting information back to the Empire, revealing the location of the hidden Rebel base. The Empire consequently launched an all-out [[Battle of Hoth|assault]] on the planet, forcing Chewbacca, Solo, Organa and C-3PO to flee on the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name="Episode V" />

However, with the ''Falcon''{{'s}} damaged hyperdrive, they were unable to leave the system and escape the Imperial blockade, which prompted Solo to pilot the ship into a nearby asteroid field, hoping that the Imperials would be unwilling to follow them there. Evading several pursuing TIE fighters, they landed the ship inside a cave of a large asteroid, where they hoped to hide from Imperial forces and complete repairs. While waiting inside the cavern, Chewbacca continued to repair the freighter until [[mynock]]s attacked it; soon, they realized the cave was in fact the inside of a [[Exogorth|space slug]], forcing them to flee. The ''Falcon'' was subsequently attacked by the Imperial Star Destroyer ''[[Avenger]]'', but with a maneuver devised by Solo, they were able to avoid the vessel and fled to [[Cloud City]] on the [[gas giant]] [[Bespin]], where they would request help from Calrissian, an old acquaintenance of Han's. Unbeknownst to them, they were followed by the bounty hunter [[Boba Fett]].<ref name="Episode V" />

====Cloud City====
{{Quote|Chewie, this won't help me! Save your strength, there'll be another time! The princess—you have to take care of her! Do ya hear me, huh?|Han Solo|audio=Han-ThisWontHelpMe.ogg|Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}
Upon arrival to Cloud City, the group was welcomed by Calrissian, and spent a few days until the ''Falcon'' was repaired. However, they grew increasingly suspicious, especially after C-3PO disappeared. Chewbacca took on task of finding the missing protocol droid, eventually rescuing him from a junk pile. After a scuffle with some [[Ugnaught]] workers, he brought the droid back to Organa and Solo, when Calrissian invited them to enjoy some refreshments. In truth, it was a meeting with Darth Vader, who had arrived to Cloud City before the Rebel team did and forced Calrissian into a deal to have them imprisoned.<ref name="Episode V" />

[[File:Chewbacca Chokes Lando.png|thumb|left|300px|Chewbacca chokes Lando Calrissian for betraying the group.]]
Separated from the others, Chewbacca began to partially reassemble C-3PO, when Solo was escorted back by stormtroopers, having been [[torture]]d by Vader, with Organa. They were eventually brought to Calrissian's [[carbon-freezing]] [[Carbon-freeze chamber|facilities]] where Solo was to be frozen in [[carbonite]] to test it before Skywalker arrived, for Vader desired to encase Skywalker in carbonite and present him to the Emperor. Though Chewbacca tried to fight, wanting to protect his old friend, Solo calmed him down, asking him to save his strength for another day. The Wookiee then relented and allowed himself to be placed in [[stuncuffs]] as Solo was marched off and frozen.<ref name="Episode V" />

As Chewbacca and Organa being escorted to Vader's ship, Calrissian, who was growing increasingly dissatisfied with Vader's deal, betrayed the Sith Lord and [[Escape from Cloud City|freed]] the two. Chewbacca, though, was not quick to trust him and reacted violently, choking him. The princess was able to calm him enough for Calrissian to inform them that Boba Fett was about to leave Cloud City carrying the carbonite-frozen Solo. Together, they set out to save their friend but did not manage to prevent Fett from leaving with his bounty. The team then boarded the ''Falcon'' to escape the city, briefly returning to save Skywalker, who had fought and lost a [[duel on Cloud City]] with the Sith Lord. Subsequently, the group made their escape back to the Alliance Fleet, where they parted ways—Organa, Skywalker and the droids remained with the fleet, whereas Chewbacca and Calrissian set out to find Fett and Jabba to rescue Solo.<ref name="Episode V" />

====Solo's rescue====
{{Dialogue|Leia|line1=trans|I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.|C-3PO|Oh, no! Chewbacca!|Jabba|line3=trans|At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.|attr=Chewbacca is delivered to Jabba|src=Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi}}
Aware of Solo's location on [[Jabba's Palace]], the team gradually infiltrated the fortress to [[Rescue of Han Solo|rescue]] the Corellian: First, Calrissian infiltrated as a guard, then the droids as Skywalker's "gift", then Leia Organa posing as the bounty hunter [[Boushh]] with Chewbacca as her quarry; she convinced Jabba with a thermal detonator, so the Hutt had Chewbacca imprisoned.<ref name="Episode VI" />

That night, Organa freed Solo from his encasement at the cost of her freedom, for Jabba had caught her red-handed, and whereas the princess was to remain at the Hutt's side, Solo was thrown in a cell together with Chewbacca, who gave him a passionate embrace, happy to reunite with his old friend, and told him that Skywalker would free them with the skills he had learned as a [[Jedi Knight]].<ref name="Episode VI" />

[[File:HanLukeChewie sentenced.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Han, Luke, and Chewie are sentenced to death by Jabba the Hutt.]]
Skywalker did indeed arrive and requested an audience with Jabba by [[Mind trick|influencing]] the crime lord's major-domus [[Bib Fortuna]]. After Skywalker was pit against Jabba's [[rancor]] and defeated it, the enraged Hutt ordered the execution of Chewbacca, Solo and Skywalker by casting them into the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]] in the [[Dune Sea]], to be devoured by the [[sarlacc]] that resided there. Brought to the pit in a [[skiff]], Skywalker recovered his [[Luke Skywalker's green lightsaber|new lightsaber]] and freed Chewbacca and Solo from their bonds. However, one of Jabba's staff fired at them, injuring Chewbacca, and leaving the near-blind Solo to rescue Calrissian from falling into the pit. While Organa assassinated Jabba himself, the group went on to slay the rest of the Hutt's henchmen, before destroying the crime lord's [[sail barge]] and returning to the Rebel Fleet aboard the ''Falcon''.<ref name="Episode VI" />

====Endor====

On the meeting to debrief the Alliance on the plan to destroy the [[Death Star II|second Death Star]], Chewbacca volunteered for a mission to destroy the [[Deflector shield generator|shield generator]] on the forest moon of [[Endor]], intent on following Solo, newly-appointed General of the Alliance. Joined by Organa, Skywalker, C-3PO and R2-D2, the strike team approached the moon aboard the captured Imperial [[shuttle]] ''[[Tydirium]]'', with Chewbacca piloting the ship. As the team waited to be cleared to land by the [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought|Star Dreadnought]] ''[[Executor]]'' which was overseeing the blockade of the moon, Solo urged the Wookiee to "fly casual", landing only after they were granted access by Darth Vader.<ref name="Episode VI" />

[[File:Wicket and Rebels.png|thumb|left|275px|The rebels worked with Ewoks to topple the Empire.]]
On the moon, they advanced through the forest and encountered Imperial [[scout]]s, to whom Solo accidentally reveal their position. Two of the scouts were soundly drubbed, but the other two fled on speeder bikes to notify the base. They were stopped by Organa and Skywalker, who were separated, prompting Chewbacca, Solo, the droids and Skywalker to search for her while the rest of the Rebel team made their way to the generator, to rendezvous with them the next morning.<ref name="Episode VI" />

During their search, Chewbacca came across a dead animal on a stake, which proved irresistible bait to him. He pulled at it, springing a trap that ensnared the entire group, thus resulting in the team being captured by [[Ewok]]s. Chewbacca was forced to surrender his bowcaster and was tied to a large pole, whereas C-3PO was treated like a [[deity]], and the group was transported to [[Bright Tree Village]] to become part of the banquet in C-3PO's honor. However, Skywalker tricked the Ewoks into thinking C-3PO had unleashed his "[[magic]]" by [[Telekinesis|levitating]] him with the Force, which prompted the Ewoks to release them at once. Later that night, after C-3PO's retelling of the events of Yavin and Cloud City, [[Chief]] [[Chirpa]] declared them all part of their tribe, with one Ewok giving Chewbacca an enthusiastic hug.<ref name="Episode VI" />

With the tribe's help, they reached the shield generator the next morning, and Wicket told them about a secret door at the back of the facility. Chewbacca accompanied the others and successfully entered the Imperial base. However, Palpatine was aware of their plans, as were the Imperial forces stationed at the moon, who swiftly captured them as the [[Battle of Endor|assault]] against the Death Star above began. A surprise attack by the Ewoks, however, scattered the Imperial troops, distracting them long enough for Organa and Solo to take positions at the base's door, and for Chewbacca to steal an AT-ST with the help of two Ewoks. Using the commandeered walker, they reached the generator's back entrance, where Solo boarded the Imperial transport to broadcast a message to the generator's personnel while posing as an Imperial officer, thereby tricking the installation's crew into opening the door.<ref name="Episode VI" />

[[File:Celebration_on_Endor.png|thumb|275px|right|Chewbacca and his companions celebrating the Rebel victory at Endor]]
Thanks to the success of Han Solo's ploy, the Rebel forces, Chewbacca among them, stormed the bunker, detonating explosive charges and disabling the shield generator, allowing Calrissian, [[Nien Nunb]] and [[Wedge Antilles]] to destroy the Death Star above. Chewbacca looked to the sky and cheered as he witnessed the final destruction of the battle station and, later that night, he celebrated at Bright Tree Village over a bonfire; Chewbacca danced in triumph along with his friends, old and new.<ref name="Episode VI" /> During the celebration, Calrissian told Solo and Chewbacca that the ''Falcon''{{'s}} [[Rectenna|sensor dish]] had been lost during the struggle, when [[Shara Bey]] asked him about the [[Pathfinders]]' location, to reunite with her husband, [[Kes Dameron]].<ref name="SE1">''[[Shattered Empire, Part I]]''</ref>

====Shattering the Empire====
Following the Battle of Endor, Chewbacca would join Han and their rebel companions in the Rebel Alliance's struggle against the remnants of the Empire. The morning after, he would take part in the [[Assault on an Imperial outpost|assault]] on an Imperial holdout on far side of Endor, the Rebels hitting the base hard and fast, and entering to find their [[computer]]s with data that signaled the war was not over yet.<ref name="SE1" />

Twenty days or so later,<ref>''[[Shattered Empire, Part II]]''</ref> Chewbacca participated alongside Solo, C-3PO, Kes Dameron, [[Sakas]] and other Rebel troops on a [[Raid at the Wretch of Tayron|raid]] on an ISB black site at the [[Wretch of Tayron|Wretch]] of [[Tayron]]. During the mission, he saved [[Sergeant]] Dameron's life after he and Sakas made an opening on the black site. Chewbacca also fetched C-3PO, who had fallen behind, to enter the facility and slice its computers. The group then became aware of the concurrent [[Operation: Cinder]] and contacted Calrissian to deploy the Alliance Fleet so as to successfully aid the besieged [[Naboo]].<ref name="SE3" />

===New Republic===
====Return to Kashyyyk====
=====False starts=====
{{Quote|C'mon, Chewie. Set new coordinates. It's time to get you home.|Han Solo|Aftermath}}
Now agents of the [[New Republic]], just as Wedge Antilles set out on a [[Mission to Akiva|reconnaissance mission]] that took him to [[Akiva]], Chewbacca and Solo went on their own mission to find the Empire's supply lines, during which they visited several planets, including Ord Mantell, [[Ando Prime]], [[Kara-bin]] and finally [[Dasoor]]. However, Chewbacca was forced to remain on the ''Falcon'', while Solo investigated on his own; having grown bored, he got to messing around with the ship's navigation system, trying to chase down a glitch that had been screwing up the hyperspace drive. Though he fixed it, the guns stopped working, which they only discovered when they were ambushed by a trio of [[Krish (species)|Krish]] marauder-ships.<ref name="Aftermath" />

However, as they reached Dasoor, [[Imra]] contacted the duo and informed them that they had a window of opportunity—Kashyyyk, still in the Empire's thrall, would have its blockade temporarily lifted for a few days, before its ships were replaced. Seeing Chewbacca's anxiety, Solo told Imra to gather any underworld scoundrel who owed him a favor, anyone who hated the Empire, and others in the false promise that they would obtain full pardons from the Republic, whereas Chewbacca was tasked to contact the Wookiee [[Mercenary|mercenaries]], among them [[Roshyk]], [[Hrrgn]], and [[Kirratha]].<ref name="Aftermath" />

When Han's wife Leia learned about Han Solo's hastily-improvised plan, she tried to advice her husband and Chewie not to trust Imra. However, Han and Chewie were determined to proceed with their [[Liberation of Kashyyyk|campaign]] to liberate Kashyyyk. Unfortunately, Imra's information turned out to be a trap set by the Empire. While Chewbacca attempted to board a gunship captained by Kirratha, they were attacked by two Star Destroyers and several TIE fighters. The Imperials shot out Kirratha's engines, leaving Chewie and Kirratha stranded in space. Han managed to escape but Chewbacca was captured and locked inside the automated Imperial prison [[Ashmead's Lock]] in the jungles of Kashyyyk. Solo traveled through Wild Space on the ''Millennium Falcon'' in attempt to find a way to free his friend.<ref name="Life Debt">''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]''</ref>

=====Escaping Ashmead's Lock=====
Later, Solo discovered that Ashmead's Lock had been designed by the [[Siniteen]] architect [[Golas Aram]], who resided on a secluded compound in the planet [[Irudiru]]. Han was joined by a team of rebels consisting of the New Republic starfighter pilot [[Norra Wexley]], her son [[Temmin Wexley]], his battle droid [[Mister Bones]], the former Imperial [[loyalty officer]] [[Sinjir Rath Velus]], the Zabrak bounty hunter [[Jas Emari]], and the New Republic soldier [[Jom Barell]]. Norra and her team had been sent by Pricness Leia to rescue Han. Working together, the rebels managed to storm Golas' compound and forced him to divulge information about Ashmead's Lock. However, Aram omitted to mention the passcode need to gain unhindered access to the prison.<ref name="Life Debt" />

Following a struggle with Ashmead Lock's computer system [[Synthesized Operating Layer, Grid-Based Drive Array|SOL-GDA]], Solo and Jas managed to disable the prison's power generator, which was fueled by the prisoners who were held in stasis. Solo managed to free Chewbacca and a hundred other prisoners including Norra's husband and Temmin's father [[Brentin Lore Wexley]]. Following an emotional reunion, Chewbacca stayed behind with Solo, Sinjir, Jas, and Jom while Norra, Temmin, and Mister Bones returned with the other liberated prisoners to the New Republic [[capital]] of [[Chandrila]].<ref name="Life Debt" />

=====Liberation of Kashyyyk=====
For the next month, Han and Chewie organized a campaign to hunt down [[Grand Moff]] [[Lozen Tolruck]], the governor of Kashyyyk. Lozen had fitted all of the Wookiees living on Kashyyyk with [[Control chip|inhibitor chips]] which he controlled using a control module that he kept on his person. In order to defeat Grand Moff Tolruck, Chewie and his rebel allies devoted their time to finding Tolruck's [[Lozen Tolruck's island fortress|island fortress]]. Jas also recruited more Wookiee exiles and smugglers for their planned uprising. During this time, Jom was captured and imprisoned by Tolruck.<ref name="Life Debt" />

While Chewie, Han, and the rest of the team infiltrated [[Camp Sardo]], Sinjir infiltrated Tolruck's palace disguised as an Imperial officer. Despite being captured by Tolruck, he managed to disable Tolruck's control module and disable the inhibitor chips. This set off a mass Wookiee uprising all over Kashyyyk. Meanwhile, Chewie and his team fought off a [[Low-altitude Imperial transport]] while Jas destroyed Camp Sardo's deflector shield generator. With the aid of Han's rebel forces, the Wookiees managed to overwhelm the meager Imperial garrison on Kashyyyk.<ref name="Life Debt" />

After Grand Moff Tolruck summoned the three orbiting Imperial Star Destroyers to bombard Kashyyyk, Chewie and his fellow rebels helped usher the liberated Wookiees into underground shelters. In response, Chewbacca along with Han, Sinjir, and Jom Barell traveled aboard the Star Destroyer ''[[Dominion]]''. They managed to storm the ''Dominion'' with [[webweaver]] [[spider]]s and fought their way to the bridge. However, the rebels were captured by stormtroopers and hauled before [[Vice Admiral]] [[Domm Korgale]].<ref name="Life Debt" />

Before Korgale could deal with the prisoners, New Republic reinforcements arrived in the form of Princess Leia aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'', Captain Wedge Antilles and his [[Phantom Squadron (New Republic)|Phantom Squadron]], and [[Fleet Admiral]] Ackbar's flagship ''[[Home One]]''. Chewbacca and his allies managed to break free from their captors and seize control of the ''Dominion''. They then used the ''Dominion''{{'s}} cannons to destroy the nearby ''[[Vitiator]]''. As a result, the remaining Imperial Star Destroyer ''[[Neutralizer]]'' capitulated to the New Republic. Following the liberation of Kashyyyk, Chewbacca stayed behind to reunite with his family at the insistence of Han Solo. Solo then left on the ''Millennium Falcon'' to look after his wife and his unborn son Ben Solo.<ref name="Life Debt" />

=====Reunion with Waroo=====
In the successive months, Chewbacca took part in mopping up operations against the remaining Imperial holdouts on Kashyyyk. While accompanying Greybok and several New Republic soldiers on one such operation, they stumbled upon [[Commandant]] [[Dessard]] and several Imperial soldiers preparing to execute an escaped Wookiee slave who turned out to be Chewbacca's son Lumpawaroo. The Wookiees and New Republic soldiers killed Dessard's men and took the officer prisoner. Chewie personally restrained Dessard by stepping over the commandant and placing a tree-trunk led on his back, forcing him to the ground. Chewbacca then experienced an emotional reunion with his lost son, who had been forced to work at a child labor camp on the slopes of [[Mount Arayakyak]].<ref name="Empire's End" />

====Peaceful retirement====
{{Quote|No. No! You have to stay here. We fought like hell for this and now&hellip;this is yours. Okay? All yours. This is home. You got people here and I want you to find them. You hear me? That's my last demand. No arguments.|Han Solo to Chewbacca after liberating Kashyyyk|Aftermath: Life Debt}}
Once Kashyyyk was freed from the Imperials, Chewbacca returned to his homeworld and reestablished connections with his family.<ref name="TFAVD">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> He settled back into a peaceful domestic life on his homeworld but kept in touch with his old friend Han Solo, who had become the business owner of a shipping company and the manager of a series of prestigious piloting championships known as the [[Five Sabers]]. Chewbacca had infrequent contact with Solo's wife Leia Organa, who had become a leading [[Populists|Populist]] senator in the New Republic's [[Galactic Senate (New Republic)|Galactic Senate]]. Following the [[Napkin Bombing]], Chewbacca sent a message via [[hologram]] to Senator Organa to wish her good recovery. After revelations about Leia's true parentage as the daughter of Darth Vader destroyed her political career, Chewie along with other former Rebel Alliance veterans like Ackbar, Nunb, Calrissian, and Mothma sent messages of supported to the embattled senator.<ref name="Bloodline">''[[Bloodline (novel)|Bloodline]]''</ref>

Despite his peaceful retirement, Chewbacca decided to join him when Han Solo resumed his smuggling activities. Fortunately, the strong familial bonds and the extended lifespan of the Wookiees allowed him to spend decades away from his people.<ref name="TFAVD" />

====Smuggler's Run====
[[File:Team_Falcon_in_Seredipity_cantina.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Confrontation with bounty hunters in the ''Serendipity''.]]
Chewbacca and Solo continued their partnership. Chewbacca would keep an eye out for him, including one time during which Solo engaged a trio of bounty hunters—[[Strater]], [[Hove]], and [[Rigger]]—sent to capture him on the ''Serendipity'' cantina, and told them about their mission to Cyrkon before they realized who he was. Once they were aware of Solo's identity, Chewbacca sneaked behind them and took hold of Rigger, only to send him flying to the ''Serendipity''{{'s}} door and knock Strater out with a punch, while Solo disarmed Bobbie. Then, the Corellian told them to warn their possible employers ([[Gannis Ducain]], the [[Irving Boys]], the [[Guavian Death Gang|Guavians]], etc.) that they were not afraid of them, before saying goodbye to Leighton and leaving the bar together.<ref name="Smuggler's Run" />

===Cold war===
====Recovering the Millennium Falcon====
{{Quote|Chewie, we're home.|Han Solo upon entering the ''Millennium Falcon'' with Chewbacca after recapturing the freighter|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}
[[File:OldSpaceFolksHome-TFAT2.png|right|thumb|300px|Han and Chewie are reunited with the ''Millennium Falcon'' once again]]
At some point during the 30 years after the Battle of Endor, the ''Millennium Falcon'' was stolen from Han and Chewbacca,<ref name="ICS">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: Incredible Cross-Sections]]''</ref> at the age of 234<ref name="SW:TFA:TVD">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref>, and they were using a ''Baleen''-class heavy freighter, the ''[[Eravana]]'', for their smuggling operations.<ref name="ICS" /> They eventually recovered the ''Falcon'' using their freighter's tractor beam after it was found floating in space not too far from the planet [[Jakku]]. Upon boarding their old vessel, Han and Chewie went about inspecting their ship and found the Jakku scavenger [[Rey]] and the defecting [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtrooper]] [[Finn]] hiding, who Han assumed were the thieves that had stolen the ''Falcon''. When Rey and Finn explained that they were going to take a droid named [[BB-8]] to the Resistance as he had a map that would reveal Luke's location, Han and Chewie agreed to help them..<ref name="VII">[[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']]</ref>

[[File:Corellian Standoff.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Chewbacca and Han are confronted by two criminal factions aboard the ''Eravana''.]]
Unfortunately, their freighter was boarded by two notorious criminal factions, the Guavian Death Gang and Kanjiklub, that had hired Solo on previous jobs, jobs which he had failed to complete. Not wanting Rey and Finn to be involved, Han placed both of them in the lower corridors of the freighter while he and Chewie went to meet with the criminals, with BB-8 accompanying them. The smuggler tried but failed to convince both parties that he would fix things eventually, with the Guavian Death Gang negotiator, Bala-Tik recognizing the BB-8 astromech droid from a First Order bounty placed on it. They demanded that Han hand over the droid and any stowaways he might have on board. As the scuffle continued, Rey accidentally released three [[rathtar]]s. Han, Chewie, Finn, Rey, and BB-8 managed to escape the gangs and jumped into hyperspace in the ''Falcon'', though Chewie was injured from a blaster shot during the escape.<ref name="VII" />

====Confronting the First Order====
Chewbacca accompanied Han, Rey, Finn, and BB-8 to meet with Maz. After the [[First Order]] was tipped off that BB-8 was with them, they [[Battle of Takodana|attacked]] [[Maz Kanata's castle|Maz's castle]]. During the fighting at the castle, despite killing multiple stormtroopers, Han, Chewbacca, and Finn were captured by the First Order. However, the Resistance had also been tipped off, and Resistance [[T-70 X-wing starfighter]]s led by [[Poe Dameron]] arrived to fight the First Order. A fierce dogfight ensued and resulted in the destruction of many First Order TIEs and the deaths of many stormtroopers from X-wing strafing runs. Ren ordered the First Order to pull out, saying they had what they came for. As the battle raged on above the castle, the remaining First Order troops boarded their ships and retreated, taking the captured and unconscious Rey along with them. Despite the First Order being driven off, Han witnessed Kylo Ren carrying Rey away. The remaining ''Falcon'' crew then rendezvoused with the Resistance at their home base.<ref name="VII" /> There Chewbacca's wounds were treated by Resistance doctor, Major [[Harter Kalonia]].<ref name="SW:TFA:TVD" />

As Starkiller Base prepared to wipe out the world of D'Qar, the site of the Resistance's headquarters, the Resistance planned an attack of their own. Finn had given them the Base's blueprints, which revealed a critical weak point -a thermal oscillator- that, if destroyed, would eliminate the Base. However, they would need to do it before the base fully charged its weapon.<ref name="VII" />

[[File:En Route to Starkiller Base.jpeg|thumb|250px|right|Chewbacca with Han and Finn, en route to Starkiller Base.]]
Han Solo piloted the ''Falcon'' to Starkiller Base accompanied by Chewbacca and Finn. Their objective was to disable the shields and allow the X-Wing squadron to strike, although Finn's main objective was to rescue Rey. Flying through the shields at lightspeed, the Falcon landed roughly on the edge of a cliff. Han, Chewbacca, and Finn snuck into the main base and captured [[Phasma|Captain Phasma]], who they forced to disable the shields before disposing her in a [[Garbage compactor|garbage chute]]. They reunited with Rey, who had already escaped on her own. With the shields down, Blue Squadron and Red Squadron led by Poe Dameron commenced [[Battle of Starkiller Base|their assault]]. They fired on the base's weakpoint, but failed to destroy it as the First Order sent TIE Fighters to stage a counterattack and throw the Resistance into chaos.<ref name="VII" />

Seeing this, Han, Chewbacca, Finn, and Rey tried to create an opening by planting thermal detonators inside the base. Han then confronted his son, Kylo Ren, named Ben Solo at birth, on a bridge over a large pit, pleading with his son to reject Snoke and return to the light side of the Force. Ben, removing his mask and seeming almost regretful, handed his lightsaber to Solo, and asked for his father's help, in which Solo replied that he would do anything for him. Ben then thrust his weapon through Han's chest. Witnessed by Rey, Finn, and Chewbacca, Han stroked his son's face for the last time, before falling to his death. Howling in fury, Chewbacca fired on Ren with his bowcaster, while Finn and Rey also fired on Ren and the surrounding stormtroopers. Chewbacca managed to land a hit on Ren's waist with his bowcaster, injuring him, but Ren managed to chase them out of the base. Chewbacca then detonated the charges, allowing Poe to fly in and destroy the base's weak point thirty seconds before it drained the sun to charge the superweapon. This caused a chain reaction to go off, which destroyed the base and leveled the entire planet's terrain.<ref name="VII" />

Following the confrontation with Kylo Ren, who was overpowered and wounded by Rey, Chewbacca arrived with the ''Millennium Falcon'' to rescue the scavenger and Finn, who was severely wounded by Ren. They and the remainder of the Resistance fleet managed to escape Starkiller Base as it erupted into a star, and entered hyperspace to return to D'Qar.<ref name="VII" />

The Resistance celebrated their victory while Leia, Chewbacca, and Rey [[Mourning|mourned]] Han's death. R2-D2 suddenly awoke and revealed that he held the map to Luke's location, with the only piece of the map missing being the one BB-8 was given by Poe. Together they completed the map and revealed the location of the planet on which Luke Skywalker was hiding. Using this, Chewbacca, R2-D2, and Rey flew aboard the ''Falcon'' to [[Ahch-To]], where Luke was exiled.<ref name="VII" />

====Time on Ahch-To====
After Rey tried and failed to recruit Luke Skywalker, Chewie greeted his old ally aboard the ''Millennium Falcon'', with Luke growing unnerved upon learning of Han Solo's demise. Later that evening, Chewie caught and roasted two [[porg]]s for dinner, but relented when their brethren approached him, watching sadly.<ref name="VIII">[[Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VIII ''The Last Jedi'']]</ref>

During the [[Battle of Crait]] between the remaining forces of the Resistance and a First Order invasion army, Chewbacca piloted the ''Millennium Falcon'', using it to lure the Order's TIE fighters away from a force of Resistance [[V-4X-D ski speeder|ski speeders]]. After the battle, he landed the ship and used it to evacuate the surviving members of the Resistance.<ref name="VIII" />

==Personality and traits==

[[File:Chewbacca ME.png|left|thumb|200px|Chewbacca crushes a stormtrooper under his foot]]
Known for his great strength, bravery and loyalty, Chewbacca often served as Solo's conscience in their smuggling endeavors,<ref name="anh-PSFB" /> which made people trust him more than they did Solo.<ref name="Smuggler's Run" /> However, he was also known for his stubbornness and dislike of losing.<ref name="Episode IV" /> He would also show no qualms about using violence as a means to achieve his goals, but he certainly never killed without a good reason.<ref name="SW10" />

As a Wookiee, Chewbacca knew passion and thus, the Rebellion, and would have stood with them from the beginning, if not for Solo and the ''Falcon''; he would not abandon them as he was bound to both, as they were to him.<ref name="Smuggler's Run" /> Few people knew that he had a mushy heart under his warrior exterior.<ref name="anh-PSFB" /> Sometimes, when he was bored, he would "mess around" with the ''Falcon''{{'s}} navigation system.<ref name="Aftermath" />

When his friend Han Solo briefly went missing while conducting a night time search and rescue mission on the planet Hoth, Chewbacca was visibly upset and worried while he awaited Solo's return. Later, when Solo was to be encased in carbonite in Cloud City, he tried to fight to save him despite the presence of the Sith Lord Darth Vader and an Imperial security detail.<ref name="Episode V" />

Chewbacca's desire to free his family and people led him to take part in Han Solo's campaign to liberate Kashyyyk from Imperial rule. He came up with the idea of using webweaver spiders to storm the Star Destroyer ''Dominion''.<ref name="Life Debt" /> Chewbacca loved his wife Mallatobuck and son Lumpawaroo, who had been separated from him by the Empire. He and his son experienced an emotional reunion during the liberation of Kashyyyk.<ref name="Empire's End" />

==Skills and abilities==
[[File:Chewbacca Bowcaster TFA.png|right|thumb|250px|Chewbacca was a skilled marksman with his custom bowcaster]]
Besides the characteristic strength of his species, Chewbacca possessed exceptional skills in piloting as well as mechanic repairs, from his experience of piloting the ''Millennium Falcon'', of which he had a great understanding of the temperamental nature of its systems.<ref name="Smuggler's Run" /> Although not particularly meticulous, Chewbacca's technical skill allowed him to understand the inner workings of a great number of devices, including droids<ref name="Episode V" /> and transmitters, being able to build one out of a wrecked starship.<ref name="Wookiee Hunt" />

Like many of his people, Chewbacca preferred their native bowcaster as his personal weapon. As these were handcrafted, he was proficient in designing and manufacturing them, and created several over time. The latest known bowcaster that he crafted was during the [[Imperial Era|Imperial era]]. It was an unconventional design, as he had used the frame and [[Power cell|power pack]] of a stormtrooper blaster.<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" />

In the non-canon crossover ''[[Phineas and Ferb: Star Wars]]'', Chewbacca is voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]].

Chewbacca was a major character in many stories of the Expanded Universe, the continuity now known as [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]], but was killed off in the novel ''[[The New Jedi Order: Vector Prime]]''.<ref name="vector">''[[The New Jedi Order: Vector Prime]]''</ref> Chewbacca's death in this publication was marked as Number One in the [[2005]] article ''[[20 Most Memorable Moments of the Expanded Universe]]'', published in the ''[[Star Wars Insider]]'' official magazine.<ref>{{InsiderCite|83|20 Most Memorable Moments of the Expanded Universe}}</ref> On [[April 25]], [[2014]], the Expanded Universe was declared non-[[canon]] as a whole, with the only elements considered canon being the original and prequel films, the television series ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'', the [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|film]] that launched it, and most material released after that date.<ref name="End of EU">{{SW|url=/news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page.html|text=The Legendary Star Wars Expanded Universe Turns a New Page}}</ref> [[George Lucas]] placed off-limits the possibility to use Chewbacca in ''The Clone Wars'' when writer [[Henry Gilroy]] was writing the show bible,<ref>TheForce.net.[http://theforce.net/jedicouncil/interview/henrygilroyanddavefiloni.asp TheForce.net - Jedi Council - Interviews - Cellblock 1138 - Dave Filoni and Henry Gilroy]. Retrieved on [[November 18]], [[2017]].</ref> though he later appeared in the third season episode "[[Wookiee Hunt]]."

[[File:Chewnewlarge.jpg|right|thumb|150px|John Schoenherr's illustration (left) and Ralph McQuarrie's Chewbacca concept art (right)]]
He was based on [[Indiana]], an [[wikipedia:Alaskan malamute|Alaskan malamute]] dog owned by George Lucas in the [[wikipedia:1970s|1970s]]. There were many early versions of Chewbacca's appearance (including one concept art that eventually became the basis of the [[Lasat]]). His final appearance in the movie is based on a 1976 piece of concept art by [[Ralph McQuarrie]], which in turn was based on an illustration by John Schoenherr for George R.R. Martin's novelette "And Seven Times Never Kill a Man", published in the July 1975 issue of Analog. The Schoenherr illustration also includes a weapon that became an inspiration for Chewbacca's bowcaster.<ref>[http://binarybonsai.com/2010/09/18/george-lucas-stole-chewbacca-but-its-okay/ George Lucas Stole Chewbacca, But It's Okay] at The Binary Bonsai</ref>

For his appearances in the original trilogy, the Chewie suit, designed by [[Stuart Freeborn]], was made out of knitted mohair (made from goat and rabbit hair) and yak hair. It would later be used and retouched during the making of [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']] for [[Senator]] [[Yarua]]. For his appearance in ''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'', Chewbacca was completely remade, with newer, more efficient and cost-effective materials. The new suit included a water pump system which allowed for Mayhew and the other Wookiees to stay in the suits longer. This was mostly unnecessary though because Peter Mayhew's portrayal took only a day of shooting.

[[File:Chewie suit btm.jpg|right|thumb|150px|The parts making up the Chewbacca costume.]]
The memorable voice of Chewbacca was designed by [[Ben Burtt]], sound designer for all seven films. He mixed together various animal growls for different emotions, including those of walruses, bears, tigers, camels and badgers. The most prominent of these voices was a [[Wikipedia:Black bear|black bear]] named [[Tarik]], who died of congestive heart failure in [[1994]].
