{{Quote|He taught me so much about politics, leadership, and war, but above all he taught me that no price is too great to pay for our ideals. Bail Organa was willing to die if that meant the Empire would fall. He believed in the New Republic we have been able to create, and in the promise of fair, equal government for everyone under the law.|Leia Organa memorializes her father, Bail Organa|Bloodline (novel)}}
'''Bail Organa''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] [[Alderaanian]] [[Politics|politician]], an influential voice for peace in the [[Galactic Senate]] during the last days of the [[Galactic Republic]], and a founding member of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. Organa, the [[senator]] of [[Alderaan]], was an outspoken member of the Senate's [[Loyalist Committee]] that pushed to maintain the ideals of the Republic during the [[Clone Wars]]. He became an architect of the [[Early rebellion against the Galactic Empire|early rebellion]] against the [[Galactic Empire]] and believed that a full-scale [[Galactic Civil War]] was inevitable if the Empire was to be toppled and replaced by a [[New Republic]].

During the Clone Wars, Organa often worked closely with Senators [[Padmé Amidala]] of [[Naboo]] and [[Mon Mothma]] of [[Chandrila]] in an attempt to de-escalate the war with the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] and bring about a peaceful, diplomatic resolution to the [[Standard year|years]]-long conflict. He was an opponent of the [[Republic military enhancement bill]] that increased the production of [[clone trooper]]s for the [[Grand Army of the Republic]], as well as the architect of the [[Alderaan Refugee Conference]] to deal with the [[refugee]]s displaced by the war with the Separatist Alliance. At times he became caught in the action of the war, including when his relief effort on [[Christophsis]] fell under Separatist siege shortly before the [[Battle of Christophsis]]. He also ensured that relief supplies could be delivered to the [[Twi'lek|citizens]] of [[Ryloth]] during the Separatist [[Battle of Ryloth|occupation]] of the planet.

After the [[Proclamation of the New Order|transformation]] of the Republic into the Empire, Organa continued to serve in the [[Imperial Senate]] but quietly began organizing a rebel movement to combat the Empire. He and his [[Marriage|wife]], [[Alderaanian monarchy|Queen]] [[Breha Organa]] of Alderaan, secretly adopted [[Leia Organa]], who came into their care after her mother, Senator Amidala, died and her husband, [[Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker]], fell to the [[dark side of the Force]]. [[Prince]]ss Leia followed in her father's footsteps and succeeded him in the Senate while quietly supporting the Rebel Alliance. Organa tasked her with finding [[Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], his old friend and ally, in exile on [[Tatooine]] and bringing him into the fight. Bail then returned home to Alderaan to inform his people that war was coming, a warning that would come too late. Shortly thereafter, Organa and the queen were killed when the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]], an Imperial [[superweapon]], [[The Disaster|destroyed]] Alderaan. They were remembered fondly by the Rebel Alliance and the New Republic as revolutionaries who fought to restore peace and freedom in [[the galaxy]].

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
[[File:Bail.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Senator Organa shortly before the start of the Clone Wars]]
Bail Organa was a [[Politics|politician]] and a member of the [[House of Organa|royal family]] of [[Alderaan]].<ref name="Bail DB" /> At some point following the [[Invasion of Naboo]], he came to represent his [[Homeworld|home]] [[planet]] in the [[Galactic Senate|Senate]] of the [[Galactic Republic]], succeeding [[Bail Antilles]], his relative by [[marriage]].<ref name="SWCT">{{Topps|set=Star Wars: Card Trader|sformat=''Star Wars'': Card Trader|cardname=Bail Organa - Galactic Senate|link=http://starwarscardtrader.wikia.com/wiki/Bail_Organa_-_Galactic_Senate}}</ref> Organa was also the [[Viceroy]] of his homeworld and the husband of [[Breha Organa]], [[Queen]] of Alderaan.<ref name="SW PL1">''[[Princess Leia, Part I]]''</ref>

As soon as he entered the intergalactic political arena, he established strong ties with like-minded senators, including [[Padmé Amidala]] of [[Naboo]] and [[Mon Mothma]] of [[Chandrila]]. He also became close friends with [[Finis Valorum]], former [[Supreme Chancellor]] of the Republic.<ref name="SWCT" /> Due to his honesty and his commitment to justice, Organa gained the respect of his senatorial peers and came to be esteemed as a politician.<ref name="Bail DB" /> In spite of Organa's best efforts, the galactic government grew increasingly plagued by corruption, ultimately leading malcontents to take extreme action: led by the former Jedi [[Dooku|Count Dooku]], a loose affiliation of outlying star systems formed the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] and declared itself seceded from the Galactic Republic.<ref name="EncyclopediaCIS">{{SWE|groups|separatists|Separatist Alliance}}</ref> With the rise of further separatism following the rise of the Confederacy, Organa joined the Senate's [[Loyalist Committee]], the members of which supported the Republic and its leader, Supreme Chancellor [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]]. In the framework of the committee, Organa came to work closely with Padmé Amidala.<ref name="Bail DB" />

In time, the Separatist Crisis escalated into the full-scale conflict known as the [[Clone Wars]]. Organa, opposed to the war but cognizant of its inevitability, became especially active in his devotion to relief missions and other humanitarian operations. In this context, he often worked with members of the [[Jedi Order]], for whom he came to develop a deep respect.<ref name="Bail DB" />

===The Clone Wars===
====Christophsis====
{{Quote|Help us, General Kenobi, you're our only hope.|Senator Organa asking for help on [[Christophsis]]|Cat and Mouse}}
[[File:BailOrgana-Christophsis.png|thumb|right|250px|Organa leads the Christophsis relief effort]]
Shortly before the [[Battle of Christophsis]], Organa led a relief force to the planet to aid its besieged people and beleaguered Republic troops. In this context, he and his relief effort became trapped on [[Christophsis]]' surface by General [[Whorm Loathsom]]'s forces<ref name="On the Front Lines">''[[Star Wars: On the Front Lines]]''</ref> and a Separatist blockade led by the infamous [[Admiral]] [[Trench]].<ref name="Cat and Mouse">{{TCW|Cat and Mouse}}</ref> When [[Jedi Knight]]s [[Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] led an assault against Trench's fleet in an attempt to break through and aid Organa, the Admiral responded with a withering attack, forcing the Jedi to retreat behind a nearby moon. Trench staged several devastating attack runs against Organa's on-planet camp at the [[Minister of Sustenance]]'s compound in [[Chaleydonia]]<ref name="On the Front Lines" /> and draw Skywalker and Kenobi out from behind the moon, but the [[Harch]] admiral's blockade were finally broken by a [[stealth ship]] flown by Skywalker and Admiral [[Wullf Yularen|Yularen]]. Organa then thanked Skywalker for delivering the supplies<ref name="Cat and Mouse" /> and then watched as Loathsom's forces retreated.<ref name="On the Front Lines" />

====Toydaria====
[[File:BailOrganaTCW1-SWE.jpg|thumb|left|240x240px|Organa during the Clone Wars.]]
Following Christophsis, Organa was then sent on trade missions. After it's success, Organa was then contacted by Jedi Masters [[Yoda]], Mace Windu, and Obi-Wan Kenobi, who informed him of the destruction of the Republic fleet protecting Ryloth. He was then asked by them to assist Naboo Representative [[Jar Jar Binks]] in negotiating an agreement with the [[Toydarian]]s to allow them use their planet to send relief supplies to Ryloth.<ref name="Supply Lines">{{TCW|Supply Lines}}</ref>

However, Organa and Binks encountered resistance from Trade Federation Senator [[Lott Dod]], who claimed that do so would violate Toydaria's neutrality. However, King Katuunko agreed to allow them to use the ships they brought to load the supplies to aid the [[Twi'lek]]s as long as the Trade Federation did not learn of the mercy mission. Organa then had Binks distract Lott Dod's party at a state dinner while he loaded the supplies aboard the ships. Following that mission, Organa, Binks and Katuunko were confronted by Dod, who claimed that Organa was responsible. However, Organa assured him that if he had any proof, he could show it to the Senate. Frustrated, Dod withdrew his argument, but warned Organa that he was playing a dangerous game.<ref name="Supply Lines" />

====Conference on Alderaan====
Organa, alongside Senator Amidala, hosted a [[Alderaan Refugee Conference|conference]] on Alderaan. However, following assassin [[Aurra Sing]]'s first attempt on Amidala, Organa and Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano tried to convince her to leave. After she refused, Organa continued the conference with a droid taking Amidala's place. He and Captain Typho then went to her quarters to stop Sing. They then took Sing into custody.<ref name="Assassin">{{TCW|Assassin (episode)|Assassin}}</ref> He then attended Amidala's party for Senator [[Aang]].<ref name="Evil Plans">{{TCW|Evil Plans}}</ref>

====Hostage Crisis====
Organa then asked Amidala to join him in Senator [[Philo]]'s meeting about the [[enhanced privacy invasion bill]]. Following the meeting, Organa and the other senators were then [[Senate hostage crisis|taken hostage]] by Cad Bane and his bounty hunters following Bane's murder of Philo. When Bane was searching the senator for communicators, Amidala told him that they must not search her because she had a [[Skywalker's lightsaber|lightsaber]]. Organa then wondered why she had one, but was more concerned about giving it back to the Jedi who own it. After Skywalker was captured by Sing, Bail and the other senators attended to him. After Bane and the other bounty hunters left, Organa and the others were saved from the explosives by Skywalker.<ref name="Hostage Crisis">{{TCW|Hostage Crisis}}</ref>

====Ahsoka Tano's trial====
Organa was present during the [[Funeral of the Jedi Temple bombing victims|funeral]] of the six Jedi killed in the [[bombing of the Jedi Temple hangar]]. He also attended the [[trial of Ahsoka Tano]], seated alongside [[Riyo Chuchi]], Mon Mothma and [[Kin Robb]] as the former Padawan was accused of masterminding the bombing. Tano was ultimately cleared of all charges when Anakin Skywalker arrived with [[Barriss Offee]], the real culprit.<ref name="The Wrong Jedi">{{TCW|The Wrong Jedi}}</ref>

====Final days of war====
[[File:Sithdelscener1pic2.jpg|thumb|250px|Organa speaking with like-minded senators.|right]]
Following the [[Battle of Coruscant|Battle]] of [[Coruscant]], Organa spoke with several senators such as Mothma and Amidala. They discussed how Palpatine had been given control of the [[Jedi High Council|Jedi Council]] and had been appointed to oversee star systems. They also discussed the possibility that Palpatine would dismantle the Senate. Organa agreed that they could not let the millennium old democracy die without a fight. Organa apologized for speaking like a separatist, but Mon Mothma assured him that they were not separatists leaving the Republic, but were [[Delegation of 2,000|loyalists]] trying to preserve it.<ref name="Stirring in Senate">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']] [http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Scenes_cut_from_Star_Wars#Revenge_of_the_Sith deleted scene]—"A Stirring in the Senate (Bail's Office)." This deleted scene was canonized in such sources as Bail Organa's Databank entry and ''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]''.</ref>

===Rise and reign of the Galactic Empire===
====Rise of the Empire====
{{Quote|Hopefully we'll be able to intercept a few Jedi before they walk into this catastrophe.|Bail Organa|Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith}}
During the attack on the Jedi Temple by the clone troopers, Bail Organa arrived and tried to demand access to the Temple. An escaping [[Zett Jukassa|Jedi]] was shot down before his eyes by the clones, prompting him to flee to his ship, ''[[Tantive III]]'', with the intent of intercepting any surviving Jedi. Masters Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi were both picked up by Organa, who took them back to Coruscant to warn any surviving Jedi to remain hidden.<ref name="ROS" />
At the end of the Clone Wars, Chancellor Palpatine transformed the democratic Republic into an authoritarian [[Galactic Empire|Empire]], bestowing upon himself the title of [[Galactic Emperor]].<ref name="ROS" /> Organa, along with other dissident members of the newly-refashioned [[Imperial Senate]] (notably, Mon Mothma) took steps to form the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]], which sought to restore democracy to the Galaxy.<ref name="EncyclopediaMM">{{SWE|characters|monmothma|Mon Mothma}}</ref>

Following the execution of [[Order 66]], Organa adopted the newborn [[Leia Organa|Leia]], daughter of the late Padmé Amidala and the fallen Jedi Anakin Skywalker, in order to protect the child from harm at the hands of the Emperor.<ref name="ROS" /> Organa and his wife, Queen Breha Organa, had always wanted a baby girl, and readily raised Leia as an Alderaanian princess. With time, Leia became a politician in her own right and a dedicated member of the Alliance.<ref name="Bail DB" /> During the reign of the Empire, Organa remained Senator of Alderaan in the Imperial Senate, though he secretly rebelled against the Empire.<ref name="Rebels Visual Guide" />

Organa was one of the only people in the galaxy who knew the whereabouts of both Yoda and Kenobi after the Purge. Although he eventually let Mothma into his confidence about Kenobi's survival,<ref name="Rogue One" /> he did not tell anyone else and even lied to his rebel allies in later years, telling them that Kenobi had been killed during the Purge.<ref name="Twin Suns">{{Rebels|Twin Suns (episode)|Twin Suns}}</ref>

====The Infancy of the Rebellion====
{{Quote|I keep an eye out for acts of kindness in this new galaxy of ours. When there's a concentration of them, I try to find out who is behind them, and then we have a talk."<br />"What do you talk about?"<br />"The Rebellion, Padawan Tano.|Bail Organa and Ahsoka Tano|Ahsoka (novel)}}
Within the first year of the Empire, Bail Organa began clandestine operations against the Empire by helping planets in need. He would intercept secure Imperial messages and send cells of rebels to act on his behalf to help citizens being oppressed by the Empire. He had gotten his friend and loyal pilot, Captain [[Raymus Antilles]], to join him in rebelling against the Empire, and the two of them were slowly recruiting the crew of the [[Tantive IV]] into their cause.<ref name="AH">''[[Ahsoka (novel)|Ahsoka]]''</ref>

One such communique described armed resistance to Imperial occupation on the moon of [[Raada]]. The message indicated that the uprising included a Jedi. Organa was surprised to learn that a survivor of Order 66 had been found, but became worried for the Jedi's safety, knowing that that Empire would want to hunt down and kill them. Later, while on Coruscant, Organa heard of additional incidents in the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] which may had also been the work of the Jedi he wished to locate. This Jedi had began running his or her own mercy missions, making sure food was delivered to those in need, stopping a Black Sun pirate, etc. Organa enlisted the help of [[Chardri Tage]] and his copilot [[Tamsin]] in order to track this elusive Jedi, although he did not tell Tage and Tamsin that the person they were looking for was, in fact, a Jedi.<ref name="AH" />

Tage and Tamsin, along with [[R2-D2]], whom Organa had borrowed from Captain Antilles, eventually found the Jedi: [[Ahsoka Tano]], the former Padawan of Anakin Skywalker during the Clone Wars. They had caught her in a [[tractor beam]] after her fight with an [[Unidentified Black Sun agent|agent]] of the [[Black Sun]] criminal gang, but were easily dispatched while attempting to tell Tano who they were. R2 told Tano that Bail Organa was trying to contact her. Tano escaped from Tage's ship, deciding to meet Organa on her own terms. When Organa traveled on the Tantive IV to meet Tage and Tamsin, Tano snuck her way onto the ship with help from R2-D2, surprising Organa in his own quarters.<ref name="AH" />

Organa told Tano about his growing rebellion against the Empire, and asked her to join his cause. She agreed, but only if Organa helped her to find a mysterious [[Inquisitorius|Imperial agent]] who was hunting down [[force-sensitive]] children. Organa gave Tano information about this agent, the [[Sixth Brother]], informing her that he was on Raada and holding Tano's friend, [[Kaeden Larte]], captive.<ref name="AH" />

After freeing Larte, Tano contacted Organa, who sent transports, the ''Tantive IV'', and [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor|A-wing fighters]] to evacuate the farmers from Raada. Afterward, Tano met Organa on his ship, where she informed him that the evacuated farmers wanted to join the rebellion. During their conversation, Tano told Organa she wanted to "take [his] recruits and find missions for them." She became the manager of Organa's intelligence network and took the codename "[[Fulcrum (title)|Fulcrum]]".<ref name="AH" />

====Aiding the rebellion====
{{Quote|Show me what you have on your&hellip; rebels.|Bail Organa, to R2-D2|Droids in Distress}}
[[File:BailR2Rebels.png|thumb|left|250px|Organa inserts a data card into R2-D2 aboard the ''Tantive IV'']]
In the [[4 BBY|fourteenth year]] of the Empire,<ref name="Rebels Visual Guide" /> Organa sent his astromech friend R2-D2, accompanied by Organa's [[protocol droid]] [[C-3PO]], on a secret mission to gather intel about the "[[Spectres]]". After the mission, the droid was returned to Organa by the rebels' leader [[Kanan Jarrus]] aboard the ''Tantive IV''. Organa thanked Jarrus by compensating him for his efforts, before reciting a Jedi saying. Once C-3PO had left the room, Organa recorded R2's footage.<ref name="Droids in Distress">{{Rebels|Droids in Distress}}</ref>

When the Spectres launched a [[Action at Mustafar|mission]] to rescue their captured leader from an Imperial fleet over [[Mustafar]], "Fulcrum" discovered their plan. As TIE fighters from the fleet closed in on them from all sides, a small fleet of Rebel ships, commanded by "Fulcrum", emerged from hyperspace and aided the rebels' escape. Once onboard the ship, [[C1-10P|Chopper]] transmitted a communication from Senator Organa, who was introduced by [[Hera Syndulla]]. He told them about the different rebel cells that he and Ahsoka had been contacting around the galaxy and that they were now coming together to unite against the Empire.<ref name="Fire Across the Galaxy">{{Rebels|Fire Across the Galaxy}}</ref>

Following the [[Blockade of Ibaar|blockade]] of [[Ibaar]], Organa was able to find a [[Slayn & Korpil|manufacturer]] to build more of [[Mon Calamari]] [[engineer]] [[Quarrie]]'s [[A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter|B-wing starfighters]] in secret.<ref name="Wings of the Master">{{Rebels|Wings of the Master}}</ref> After learning of the rebellion's losses at the [[battle on Garel]], Organa dispatched Princess Leia, then serving as his [[aide]], along with three [[Sphyrna-class corvette|''Sphyrna''-class corvettes]] — [[P1]], [[P2]] and [[P3]] — to [[Lothal]] to expand the rebel fleet, under the guise of delivering relief supplies to the people of Lothal. Leia planned for the rebels to steal them to conceal Alderaan's involvement with the rebellion.<ref name="A Princess on Lothal">{{Rebels|A Princess on Lothal}}</ref>

In [[2 BBY]], Senator Organa and [[Alliance High Command|Rebel Command]] dispatched [[Saw Gerrera]] and a team of his [[Partisans]] to investigate the disappearance of the [[Geonosian]] species. After losing contact with Saw's team, Senator Organa and the [[Phoenix Cell]]'s [[Commander]] [[Jun Sato]] dispatched Hera's rebel cell and the former [[Clone Captain]] [[Rex]] to find Saw and recover his data. During the [[Mission to investigate Geonosis|mission]], the rebels rescued Saw, befriended the Geonosian [[Klik-Klak]], and discovered that the Empire had [[Sterilization of Geonosis|perpetrated genocide]] against the Geonosians. After rescuing Saw, Hera and Kanan reported their findings to Senator Organa. While Organa thought the evidence was insufficient to sway the Senate, he believed that revelations about the Geonosian genocide would turn more worlds against the Empire.<ref name="Ghosts of Geonosis">{{Rebels|Ghosts of Geonosis}}</ref>

Later that year, Senator Organa dispatched [[Phoenix Leader]] Hera Syndulla and her rebel crew on a [[Operation Handoff|mission]] to rendezvous with the former Senator Mon Mothma. Mothma had become a fugitive from the Empire after denouncing the [[Ghorman Massacre]] and wanted to travel to [[Dantooine]] in order to unify the various rebel cells and factions into an Alliance. Despite being pursued by Imperial forces dispatched by [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]], the Spectres, Mothma, and [[Gold Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Gold Squadron]] managed to reach Dantooine. Later, Organa along with other rebels including [[General]] [[Jan Dodonna]] were present at a meeting when his former colleague Senator Mon Mothma gave an impassioned [[HoloNet]] speech denouncing the Empire and announcing the formation of the Rebel Alliance.<ref name="Secret Cargo">{{Rebels|Secret Cargo}}</ref>

In [[1 BBY]], Senator Organa briefed a meeting of the Alliance leadership and the Spectres via [[hologram]] at the [[Great Temple (Yavin 4)|Great Temple]]. During the meeting, Organa corroborated the Partisan leader Saw Gerrera's intelligence that the Empire was using a [[Jalindi relay|relay station]] on [[Jalindi]] to track rebel supply lines. In response, the Spectres were dispatched on a [[Mission to Jalindi|mission]] to plant a spike on the Jalindi relay.<ref name="In the Name">{{Rebels|In the Name of the Rebellion}}</ref>

Later, Senator Organa attended a briefing with Mon Mothma, General Syndulla, and other rebel leaders on Yavin 4 to discuss the stolen [[TIE/D Defender Elite]]'s [[flight data recorder]] which Hera's Spectres had obtained on Lothal. When Organa asked if the Alliance fighters could match the new Imperial fighter, General Dodonna replied that Alliance fighters would be at a disadvantage. The Alliance leaders then discussed news of the recent activation of [[Protocol 13]] on Lothal, which entailed the evacuation of all Imperial personnel on the planet. Hera then re-entered the meeting and convinced the Alliance to authorize a [[Attack on Lothal|strike]] on Lothal. Since Hera already had a team on Lothal, Mothma authorized the operation.<ref name="Crawler Commandeers">{{Rebels|Crawler Commandeers}}</ref>

====Late Involvement in the Rebellion====
{{Quote|Are we really talking about disbanding something that we've worked so hard to create?|Bail Organa|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (novelization)}}
In [[0 BBY]], Organa spoke with Mothma following her meeting with [[Jyn Erso]]. He believed that the Imperial Senate would not act on whatever proof Erso's father, Dr. [[Galen Walton Erso|Galen Erso]] had on the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|weapon]]. Organa believed that ceding to the Emperor's will had become second nature to members of the senate. However, Mothma assured him that as long as it stood, the Alliance must try diplomacy first, but be prepared for what would come afterwards.<ref name="R1,PI">''[[Rogue One Adaptation 1]]''</ref> Organa was present at a meeting of rebel forces at their headquarters on Yavin 4 to discuss the rising threat of the new Imperial [[superweapon]]: the [[Death Star]]. Organa exclaimed his support for Erso's idea to bring the fight back to the Empire.<ref name="Rogue One" />

[[File:BailOrganaTalksToMonMothma.png|thumb|right|300px|Organa speaks to Mon Mothma about bringing Obi-Wan Kenobi out of exile to help the Rebel cause.]]
Following the meeting, Organa briefly spoke to Mon Mothma, informing her that he would be returning to Alderaan to prepare for the coming war that such actions suggested by Erso would bring about. Mothma asked Organa to bring Obi-Wan Kenobi out of his hiding on [[Tatooine]]. Bail himself could not go due to being needed to rouse Alderaan to action, so he had to sent one of his agents to find Kenobi in his place. Mothma asked if he was sending someone he could trust, and Bail replied that it was someone he would trust with his life, his adopted daughter, Leia.<ref name="Rogue One" />

====Death====
{{Quote|Let us take a moment to honor the lost souls of Alderaan. To honor Viceroy Bail Organa and Queen Breha Organa. May they forever be remembered.|Leia Organa|Princess Leia, Part I}}
[[File:DestructionOfAlderaan-ANH.png|thumb|left|250px|Organa was killed when the Death Star destroyed Alderaan.]]
About two decades after the end of the Clone Wars, [[Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]] ordered the destruction of Alderaan by use of the Death Star, an immense space station fitted with a powerful [[superlaser]].<ref name="ANH">[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]</ref> Bail Organa died in the [[The Disaster|explosion]] of his homeworld,<ref name="Bail DB" /> along with his wife.<ref name="SW PL1" />

===Legacy===
{{Quote|The simplest gesture of kindness can fill a galaxy with hope.|Bail Organa|Droids in Distress}}
[[File:Breha and Bail statues.png|thumb|right|175px|The rememberance statues in the Yavin Rebel base.]]
Statues in his and his wife's honor were erected in the ceremonial chamber of the Great Temple, from where the Alliance to Restore the Republic launched their [[Battle of Yavin|successful assault]] on the Death Star. Several members of the Alliance came to the statue to place wreaths and pay their respects. The Alliance [[pilot]] [[Evaan Verlaine]], who had been one of Queen Breha's pupils in her youth, paid her respect to the deceased leaders of Alderaan by observing a moment of silence in front of their statues.<ref name="SW PL1" />

At some point between the Battle of Yavin and [[Battle of Hoth|that]] of [[Hoth]], the [[Clawdite]] [[Changeling|shapeshifter]] [[agent]] [[Tunga Arpagion]] briefly impersonated Organa in his [[Prison|cell]] when Princess Leia extracted him from the [[Dex Acquisitions Depot]] on [[Meor Ain]]. However, the princess not only was not fooled, but also punched Arpagion in the face for trying to play games with her mind and using her late father's image.<ref name="Star Wars 45">''[[Star Wars 45: Mutiny at Mon Cala, Part II]]''</ref>

Bail Organa was a [[Bail Organa statue-dedication ceremony|celebrated]] and bipartisanly revered martyr for the [[New Republic]]. Because of his leadership abilities and unifying qualities, he was a powerful figure in a philosophy of post-imperial politics. A 70-meter-high statue of him carved from [[Jelucani fogstone]] was erected in the [[New Republic senatorial complex|senatorial complex]] in [[Republic City]] on [[Hosnian Prime]]. A hand on the statue was partially damaged during the [[Napkin Bombing]].<ref name="Bloodline" />

Soon after the Napkin Bombing and the statue of Organa's damage, a [[music box]] was discovered by the Senator of [[Arkanis]], [[Carise Sindian]]. The box, which was meant to be listened to only by Bail's adopted daughter Leia if she was given the [[governor]]ship of [[Birren]], contained the Alderaanian song [[Mirrorbright (song)|''Mirrorbright'']]. It also contained a recording of Bail's voice speaking about Leia's true parentage. This recording was later used against Leia in a Senate hearing.<ref name="Bloodline" />

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|We cannot let a thousand years of democracy disappear without a fight.|Bail Organa, during the last days of the Galactic Republic|Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith}}
Bail Organa was a [[human]] [[Sexes|man]] who served as the planet Alderaan's [[Senator]] during the last days of the Galactic Republic and the [[Imperial Era]]. As a politician, Organa was renown for his honesty and commitment to justice.<ref name="Bail DB" /> During the Clone Wars, Senator Organa forged friendships with several senators who were concerned with the increasingly autocratic rule of Chancellor Palpatine including Padmé Amidala of Naboo and Mon Mothma of Chandrila.<ref name="Stirring in Senate" /> Organa also undertook relief missions to wartorn worlds including [[Ryloth]]. Organa convinced [[Junior Representative]] Jar Jar Binks to use his talents as a clown to distract Trade Federation delegates while he facilitated the shipment of supplies to Ryloth.<ref name="Supply Lines" /> He also had a deep respect for the Jedi and did not believe Emperor Palpatine's claims that the Jedi had turned against the Republic. Organa was troubled by the execution of Jedi younglings during the Jedi Purge.<ref name="ROS" />

Senator Organa's respect for the Jedi led him to rescue Master Yoda from Kashyyyk. His friendship with Senator Amidala led him to adopt and raise her daughter Leia as his own child.<ref name="ROS" /> Organa doted over Leia and trained her in the arts of diplomacy and language.<ref name="Princess Leia Part II">''[[Princess Leia, Part II]]''</ref> While Senator Organa maintained a respectable facade during the Imperial Era, he secretly opposed the Empire and helped to sponsor the earliest manifestations of resistance. Senator Organa cultivated the former Padawan Tano as the Rebellion's first intelligence operative Fulcrum. He also used his wealth and resources to shelter refugees from Raada on Alderaan.<ref name="AH" />

As the Rebellion grew in strength, Organa devoted resources to financing and arming rebel cells such as the Spectres<ref name="Droids in Distress" /> and the Phoenix Group. He was supported in these endeavors by his adopted daughter Leia, who shared his zeal to the Rebellion and finesse for diplomacy and flattery.<ref name="A Princess on Lothal" /> Organa was widely regarded as a rebel leader and hero by many in the New Republic, who commissioned a statue in his honor. Organa's love for his daughter led him to withhold the secret that she and her brother [[Luke Skywalker]] were the descendants of the reviled [[Darth]] Vader, the Emperor's executioner.<ref name="Bloodline" />

==Behind the scenes==
Bail Organa was played by [[Jimmy Smits]] in [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]'', ''[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']] and in the [[Star Wars Anthology Series|Anthology film]] ''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''.<ref name="Rogue One" />

He is voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]] in ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''.

In the [[2016]] reference book ''[[Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded]]'', Organa's height is given as 1.91 meters,<ref name="Updated Character Encyclopedia" /> while the official [[Databank (website)|Databank]] on [[StarWars.com]] lists it as 1.99 meters.<ref name="Bail DB" /> According to Smits, Organa's garb in ''Rogue One: A Star Wars Story'' was not as stately as it was in Episodes II and III as Organa is not as high up the political food chain.<ref name="US Magazine">''[[Us Magazine Collector's Edition - Star Wars Rogue One]]''</ref>
