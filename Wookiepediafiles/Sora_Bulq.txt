'''Sora Bulq''' was a [[Sexes|male]] [[Weequay]] [[Jedi]] who served the [[Galactic Republic]] and the [[Jedi Order]] during the their galactic-wide conflict against the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. At some point before [[22 BBY]], Bulq took it upon himself to train an apprentice, [[Galdos Stouff]] who served as his [[padawan]].

After [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] discovered that the Separatists had been building up their own droid army on [[Geonosis]], Sora Bulq and his padawan, Galdos Stouff, along with 200 other readily available Jedi were dispatched to the desolate planet, and subsequently took part in the [[Battle of Geonosis]] that ensued. Sora Bulq was one of the few survivors, and was able to safely return to the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]].

During the [[Clone Wars]], Bulq was later present in a meeting in which the dastardly cyborg [[Supreme Commander of the Droid Army|leader]] of the [[Separatist Droid Army|droid army]], [[Grievous]], demonstrated his wrath to the Jedi, by torturing their fellow Jedi, [[Eeth Koth]] live through the use of a hologram for them to see. After the Jedi Temple hangar was bombed, Bulq attended the funeral for those that had lost their lives.

==Biography==
===The Battle of Geonosis===
By [[22 BBY]], tensions between the [[Galactic Republic]] and a rising faction known as the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] were growing at an alarming rate. After [[senator]] [[Padmé Amidala]] of [[Naboo]] narrowly survived multiple assassination attempts, it was discovered that the [[bounty hunter]] [[Jango Fett]] was behind it. Jedi Master [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] subsequently followed the [[Mandalorian]] to the barren world of [[Geonosis]], discovering that the Separatists had been developing their own [[Separatist Droid Army|droid army]], and contacted the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]] about his findings. Moments after sending a hologram, the Jedi was discovered and captured. [[Mace Windu]] then made the decision to assemble a [[Jedi assault team]], made up of the 200 available Jedi to crush the droid army the Separatists had been creating, and to rescue Obi Wan.<ref name="Attack of the Clones" />

Sora Bulq, as well as his apprentice, [[Galdos Stouff]] were two of the many Jedi sent out to Geonosis, as part of the Jedi assault team. After fighting valiantly against the newfound [[Separatist Droid Army]] for the majority of the battle, Sora Bulq, along with the other surviving Jedi eventually found themselves totally outnumbered by their mechanical foes, leaving them with no choice, but to form a defensive circle. Just as it seemed that all hope was lost, and that the Jedi had lost the battle, multiple [[Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry|republic gunships]] stormed the arena, with a brand new army of clone soldiers to back the Jedi. The gunships then landed, allowing for Sora Bulq and the other survivors to escape the arena.<ref name="Attack of the Clones" />

===A message from Grievous===

One year later, in [[21 BBY]], a meeting was called at the [[Jedi Temple communication center/Legends|Jedi Temple communication center]] of which many Jedi, including Sora Bulq, attended. The [[Weequay]] Jedi was already present when the leader of the Separatist Droid Army, [[General]] [[Grievous]], appeared on the [[holoprojector]] with a daunting message for the Jedi, informing them that he had captured the [[Jedi High Council]] member [[Eeth Koth]]. He taunted them as he expressed his hatred of their politics and their Republic, and that he only lived to see them die. Sora Bulq and the other Jedi watched in horror as Grievous threw Jedi Master Eeth Koth to the ground and one of his [[IG-100 MagnaGuard|MagnaGuards]] began torturing him with its [[electrostaff]].<ref name="Grievous Intrigue">{{TCW|Grievous Intrigue}}</ref>

===The Jedi Temple Bombing===

In the final year of the Clone War, [[19 BBY]], Sora Bulq was present in the Jedi Temple at the time of a [[Bombing of the Jedi Temple hangar|bombing incident]], in which the Jedi Temple hanger had exploded, causing the death of several clones, workers and six Jedi. During the investigation, led by [[Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Ahsoka Tano]], Sora Bulq walked past and witnessed Anakin enter the Jedi Temple Detention Center in order to question their prime suspect, [[Letta Turmond]].<ref name="Sabotage">{{TCW|Sabotage (episode)|Sabotage}}</ref> Sora Bulq later attended the [[Funeral of the Jedi Temple bombing victims|funeral]] of the six Jedi that had been killed in the explosion, and silently and solemnly stood, listening to Jedi Master [[Yoda|Yoda's]] eulogy for the fallen.<ref name="The Jedi Who Knew Too Much">{{TCW|The Jedi Who Knew Too Much}}</ref>
