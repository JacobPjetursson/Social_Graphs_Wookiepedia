'''Saelt-Marae'''<ref name="Absolutely Everything You Need to Know" /> was a [[Yarkora]] who worked for [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]], a powerful [[Hutt]] [[crime lord]]. Posing as a humble [[merchant]], the Yarkora mingled with the various denizens of Jabba's [[Jabba's Palace|fortress]] on [[Tatooine]], learning of the intrigues developing behind the Hutt's back and revealing those to his employer.<ref name="Absolutely Everything You Need to Know" />
Shortly before the [[Battle of Endor]], Saelt-Marae traveled on board Jabba's [[sail barge]] ''[[Khetanna]]'' to the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]] to witness the [[Death|execution]] of two of the Hutt's prisoners, [[Luke Skywalker]] and [[Han Solo]]. The prisoners were to be fed to the [[sarlacc]] which resided in the pit, but managed to escape and kill Jabba before destroying the sail barge.<ref name="ROTJ" />

Saelt-Marae was played by [[Sean Crawford]]<ref name="Website">[http://www.coolwatersprods.com/id63.html Sean Crawford's website]</ref> in the [[1983]] film [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]. In the film, he went unnamed.<ref name="ROTJ" /> Saelt-Marae was given the name "Yak Face" during the production of ''Return of the Jedi''.<ref name="DB">{{DB|character|saeltmarae|Saelt-Marae}}</ref> The character was first named in ''[[Star Wars Trilogy Sourcebook, Special Edition]]'', a [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] supplement for ''[[Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game]]'' by [[West End Games]].<ref name="TSB">''[[Star Wars Trilogy Sourcebook, Special Edition]]''</ref>

While filming of ''Return of the Jedi'' was underway, Saelt-Marae was originally supposed to have a quarrel with [[Ree-Yees]], leading [[C-3PO]] to intervene in order to separate them. Though it was indeed filmed, it was ultimately cut from the film's release.<ref name="DB" />
