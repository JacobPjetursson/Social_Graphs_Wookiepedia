'''Daultay Dofine''' was a [[Neimoidian]] [[captain]] of the [[Trade Federation]]'s [[Lucrehulk-class Battleship|Droid Control Ship]] the ''[[Vuutun Palaa]]'' during the [[Invasion of Naboo]].

==Biography==
A [[Sexes|male]] [[Neimoidian]], Daultay Dofine made a career as a [[starship]] [[captain]] in the [[Trade Federation]],<ref name="DB DD" /> one of the wealthiest corporate organizations in [[the galaxy]].<ref name="DB TF">{{Databank|trade-federation|Trade Federation}}</ref>

In [[32 BBY]],<ref name="Galactic Atlas" /> a mysterious and malevolent [[Dark Lord of the Sith|Dark Lord]] of [[Sith]] called [[Darth Sidious]] conspired with the Federation, and Dofine became one of his three principal Neimoidian collaborators, along with [[Viceroy]] [[Nute Gunray]] and [[Settlement Officer]] [[Rune Haako]].<ref name="SWE Dofine">{{SWE|characters|daultaydofine|Daultay Dofine}}</ref> Sidious arranged for the Federation to blockade and [[Invasion of Naboo|invade]] the peaceful [[planet]] of [[Naboo]] in protest over increased taxation from the Senate.<ref name="tpm" /> According to the plan, Dofine was at the helm of the ''[[Saak'ak]]'', the [[Lucrehulk-class LH-3210 cargo freighter|''Lucrehulk-''class LH-3210 cargo freighter]] that served as the Federation's [[flagship]].<ref name="TPM Journey">''[[Star Wars Journeys: The Phantom Menace]]''</ref> The captain led a [[Standard month|month]]-long blockade that left the fragile planet starved and ill-supplied.<ref name="SWE Dofine" />

Eventually, the [[Democracy|democratic]] union known as the [[Galactic Republic]] dispatched [[ambassador]]s to the ''Saak'ak'' in an attempt to resolve was looked like a mere trade dispute gone awry. However, when said ambassadors were revealed to be the [[Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and his [[Padawan]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], Dofine panicked. Suddenly doubting Darth Sidious's plan, the captain boldly told the Sith Lord that his scheme was finished if the [[Jedi]] were involved. Although he was verbally reprimanded by Sidious for speaking out of turn, Dofine nevertheless remained in command of the blockade's forces for the remainder of the operation.<ref name="tpm" />

When the blockade was complete, the Neimoidians were ready to initiate the next phase of Sidious' plan: invading and occupying Naboo. In order to do so, Dofine transferred from the ''Saak'ak'' to the [[Lucrehulk-class Battleship|Droid Control Ship]] ''[[Vuutun Palaa]]'', which contained legions of [[B1 battle droid|B1]] [[battle droid]]s.<ref name="SWE Dofine" /> It was he who gave the order to activate the ship's droids, unleashing a mechanical army on the surface of Naboo. Dofine later [[Death|perished]] aboard the vessel when it was blown up by [[Anakin Skywalker]].<ref name="tpm" />
