'''Vanden Willard''' was a [[Sexes|male]] [[human]] who served as a [[commander]] and later [[general]] in the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]]. He served at the [[Great Temple (Yavin 4)|Rebel base]] on [[Yavin 4]] during the [[Battle of Yavin]]. He was [[Death|killed]] when his [[Vanden Willard's cruiser|cruiser]] was attacked by the ''[[Executor]]'' near the [[Mako-Ta Space Docks]].

Vanden Willard<ref name="ANH junior">[[Star Wars: A New Hope (paperback novel)|''Star Wars: A New Hope'' junior novelization]]</ref> was a [[commander]]<ref name="Episode IV" /> and later [[general]]<ref name="Rebel Files">''[[Star Wars: The Rebel Files]]''</ref> in the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] at the [[time]] of the [[Battle of Yavin]]. After [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Organa]] was [[Rescue of Princess Leia|rescued]] from aboard the [[Galactic Empire]]'s [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]] by [[Luke Skywalker]], [[Han Solo]], [[Chewbacca]], [[C-3PO]], and [[R2-D2]], and returned to the [[Great Temple (Yavin 4)|hidden rebel base]] on [[Yavin 4]], Willard greeted them and was glad to know Organa was safe, as when they heard about the [[The Disaster|destruction]] of [[Alderaan]], they feared the worst.<ref name="Episode IV" />

When it was discovered that the [[Starship|ship]] they had used, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', was tracked and that the [[Death Star]] had arrived.<ref name="Episode IV" /> Willard was responsible for reviewing the [[flight simulator]] records of any [[pilot]] who wished to fly an [[X-wing starfighter]] for the Rebel Alliance prior to granting their recruitment.<ref name="ANH Illustrated">''[[A New Hope: The Princess, the Scoundrel, and the Farm Boy]]''</ref> Willard later helped coordinate the battle against the [[superweapon]].<ref name="Episode IV" /> During the battle, Willard was in the war room with [[Unidentified Control Officer|a Control Officer]], General [[Jan Dodonna]], [[Colonel]] [[Bandwin Cor]], and Organa. When Dodonna asked whether there were any other reversion signatures, Willard replied that it was just the Death Star's. A partial transcript of recordings from the war room, which included Willard's comment, was eventually placed in ''[[The Rebel Files]]''.<ref name="Rebel Files" />

===At Mako-Ta Rebel Base===

[[File:SW 50 Delta Group.png|thumb|right|250px|General Willard in his cruiser while under attack]]
In [[1 ABY]], after a failed meeting with [[Regent]] [[Urtya (Mon Calamari)|Urtya]] on [[Mon Cala]] in an attempt to recruit the [[Mon Cala Mercantile Fleet]], Willard was present at the [[Mako-Ta Space Docks]] in a meeting of [[Alliance High Command]] when [[Chancellor (Rebel Alliance)|Chancellor]] [[Mon Mothma]] requested the report on Mon Cala by Organa. As Organa stated that Urtya would never lead a mutiny against the Empire, Willard reacted with disappointment. Organa continued, and outlined her plan to rescue [[King of Mon Cala|King]] [[Lee-Char]], in order to secure an alliance with the [[Mon Calamari]] and incorporate the [[fleet]] into their own [[Alliance Fleet|naval forces]].<ref name="SW 45" />

Eventually, Organa and [[Leia Organa's team|her team]] were able to breach a [[Unidentified Imperial base (Strokill Prime)|prison]] on [[Strokill Prime]] and find Lee-Char. Too injured to move, they recorded his final words before he was [[Death|killed]] by Imperial [[stormtrooper]]s.<ref name="SW 48">''[[Star Wars 48: Mutiny at Mon Cala, Part V]]''</ref> Although Urtya was able to recover the recordings from Organa, he sent the message to the [[Fleet Captain]]s of the Mon Cala fleet, resulting in their [[Mutiny on Mon Cala|mutiny]] and defection to the Rebel Alliance.<ref name="SW 49">''[[Star Wars 49: Mutiny at Mon Cala, Part VI]]''</ref>

After the mutiny, Willard was given command of [[Vanden Willard's cruiser|a cruiser]] that had been refitted for combat by the [[Kingdom of Shu-Torun]], by order of [[Queen]] [[Trios]]. Willard utilized the [[cruiser]] as the [[flagship]] of [[Delta Group]] and remained present at the Mako-Ta Space Docks during a ceremony celebrating the new Alliance Fleet and for rebel personnel and rebel allies to witness the dispersal of the rebel [[Navy|naval]] forces. During the ceremony, Willard invited Organa to his cruiser, but she turned down the request, preferring to be with Mothma just in case she was needed.<ref name="SW 50" />

Prior to launch, Organa asked for a check-in of sub-groups, and Willard was the final one to confirm that group had no issues. Willard also told Organa to tell Mothma good luck for her speech, believing that she would stun the crowd. After Organa informed Mothma that the fleet was ready, she also mentioned Willard's statement, and told Mothma that he knew he would be impressed.<ref name="SW 50" />

As the ships were ready to launch into [[hyperspace]], an error prevented the launch of the Willard's cruiser, as well as all the other ships that had been refitted with [[Shu-Torun]] technology. The fault resulted in the failure of all launches, lost communications, disabled armament, and the ships being unable to launch their [[starfighter]]s. At the same [[time]], [[Death Squadron]], under the command of the [[Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], [[Attack on the Mako-Ta Space Docks|arrived]] and fired on the nearest cruiser, Willard's starship.<ref name="SW 50" />

===Death===

[[File:SW 50 Willard final moments.png|thumb|left|225px|Willard's final moments aboard his cruiser]]
As Willard's cruiser was attacked by the ''[[Executor]]'' and an accompanying [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyer]], Mothma, Organa, General [[Davits Draven]], and other rebel personnel watched on in horror from the base. Consistently pummeled by [[laser]] fire, Willard ordered all power to be routed to the [[deflector shield]]s, but a crewmember stated that they were quickly losing them. In response, Willard ordered that the ship be abandoned, but the ship was quickly annihilated as Willard told his crew that [[May the Force be with you|may the Force be with them all]].<ref name="SW 50" />

An enormous eruption engulfed the cruiser, and [[Darth]] Vader looked on from the [[Bridge (starship)|bridge]] of the ''Executor'', satisfied that the rebels now understood and that he felt their terror.<ref name="SW 50" />
