{{Quote|If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, you'd probably short-circuit!|C-3PO, to R2-D2|Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi}}
'''Jabba Desilijic Tiure''', more commonly referred to as '''Jabba the Hutt''' or simply '''Jabba''', was a [[Hutt]] gangster and [[crime lord]], as well as a member of the [[Grand Hutt Council]], who operated and led a [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure's criminal empire|criminal empire]] from his [[Jabba's Palace|palace]] on the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] [[Planet|world]] of [[Tatooine]]. Jabba was a major figure on Tatooine, where he controlled the bulk of the trafficking in illegal goods, [[Pirate|piracy]] and [[slavery]] that generated most of the planet's wealth. He was also highly influential in the entire Outer Rim as one of its most powerful crime lords.

During the [[Clone Wars]], Jabba's influence and power over the Outer Rim, specifically its [[Hyperspace route|hyperlanes]], was sought by both the [[Galactic Republic]] and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]], who both courted Jabba's approval. When [[Rotta]], Jabba's son, was kidnapped, the crime lord promised his support to whomever returned his son. When the Separatists were revealed to have orchestrated Rotta's kidnapping, Jabba pledged his support to the Republic.

Jabba continued to operate in the Outer Rim after the end of the Clone Wars and the rise of the [[Galactic Empire]], preserving his power base, despite the interference of [[Darth Sidious]], the [[Galactic Emperor]]. After the [[Battle of Yavin|destruction]] of the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]] by the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]], the Emperor sent [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] to [[Attack on Cymoon 1#Aftermath|negotiate]] a deal with Jabba to secure raw materials for [[Imperial Military|Imperial military]] production. Jabba's alliance with the Empire allowed him and the Hutts to survive the Imperial crackdown against criminal elements in the Outer Rim, as well as rid the Hutt of his competitors.

After the smuggler [[Han Solo]] failed to repay him for lost cargo, Jabba placed a high price on his head. Solo was eventually delivered to him by one of his [[bounty hunter]]s, [[Boba Fett]], as a gift from Darth Vader. However, this capture brought him to the attention of [[Jedi Knight]] [[Luke Skywalker]], who sought to rescue his friend from Jabba's imprisonment. As he attempted to execute the Jedi and his allies in the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]], Jabba was choked to [[death]] by [[Leia Organa]].

==Biography==
===Tatooine crime lord===
[[File:Jabba Boonta Eve.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Jabba hosts the Boonta Eve Classic podrace in [[32 BBY]]]]
Jabba Desilijic Tiure<ref name="AEYNTK" /> was a [[Hutt]] who hailed from [[Tatooine]], a [[desert]] [[Planet|world]] in the [[Outer Rim Territories]].<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" /> He was born in [[600 BBY]].<ref name="AEYNTK" /> He was the grandson of [[Mama]] and [[Ziro's father|Papa]] the Hutts, and the nephew of [[Ziro Desilijic Tiure/Canon|Ziro]] and [[Ebor]].<ref name="HFZ">{{TCW|Hunt for Ziro}}</ref> His [[Parent|mother]] left enough of a mark on him that, years later, he would force the [[Askajian]] dancer [[Yarna d'al' Gargan]] to wear special makeup to make her look more like his genitrix.<ref name="Character Encyclopedia">''[[Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded]]''</ref>

Several [[Standard century|centuries]] before the [[Galactic Civil War]], he became the reigning [[crime lord]] in the Outer Rim, owning several criminal enterprises which included smuggling, glitterstim [[spice]] dealing, [[Slavery|slave]] trading, assassination and [[Pirate|piracy]].<ref name="RotJ junior novel">[[Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (paperback novel)|''Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'' junior novelization]]</ref> He gained a seat on the [[Grand Hutt Council]], and also became affiliated with the [[Crymorah syndicate]]. As a crime lord, Jabba based his illicit operation out of his [[Jabba's Palace|palace]] in the [[Northern Dune Sea]] of Tatooine, from where he spread his operations and influence across the Outer Rim by employing a network of [[smuggler]]s who moved his goods across [[the galaxy]], forming a powerful [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure's criminal empire|criminal empire]]. His operations grew to include [[slavery]], arms dealing, [[spice]] smuggling, and gambling. Gambling was a prominent feature of the [[Mos Espa Grand Arena]], where Jabba built grandstands from which he could control the gambling and concessions during [[Podracing|podraces]].<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" />

Shortly after the start of the [[Invasion of Naboo]], Jabba presided over the [[Boonta Eve Classic]] podrace, where his entrance in the stands was greeted with cheers from the spectators who came to watch the race from all corners of the Outer Rim Territories. Jabba signaled the start of the race and the podracers began their laps, at the end of which [[Anakin Skywalker]], a young slave from [[Mos Espa]], emerged victorious. Jabba had to be awoken after falling asleep during the race,<ref name="Episode I">[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']]</ref> as podracing did not interest him&mdash;aside from the gambling involved.<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" />

===The Clone Wars===
====Alliance with the Republic====
{{Quote|Perhaps now, you will allow the Republic to use your trade routes and hostilities can come to an end.''"<br />"''Jabba agrees. A treaty is in order.|Senator Padmé Amidala and TC-70, the latter of whom spoke for Jabba|Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)}}
Ten years after the Naboo Crisis,<ref name="Episode II">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]</ref> the galaxy was plunged into the chaos of the [[Clone Wars]], a massive galactic conflict between the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] and the [[Separatist Droid Army|droid armies]] of the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]]. Shortly after the [[Battle of Geonosis|outbreak]] of the war, Jabba's infant son, [[Rotta]], was kidnapped. Though Jabba did not know who the kidnapper was, it was carried out by his uncle, Ziro, and the Separatist Alliance, both of whom had their own schemes at play. Jabba requested the assistance of anyone who could help, and the Republic and the [[Jedi Order]] answered the call. It was the hope of [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] that the Republic would be able to negotiate an alliance with Jabba for use of Hutt [[hyperspace]] lanes in the Outer Rim, as the Separatists controlled the major lanes.<ref name="TCW-film" />

[[File:Jabba confers.png|thumb|300px|right|Jabba confers with Chancellor Palpatine]]
The Jedi sent [[Jedi General|General]] Anakin Skywalker, who had become a [[Jedi Knight]] in the years since his victory in the Boonta Eve Classic, and his [[Padawan]], [[Ahsoka Tano]], to the [[Teth system]] to find Rotta. General [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], meanwhile, traveled to Tatooine to personally negotiate a treaty with Jabba. While the [[Jedi Master]] was en route, Jabba was presented with the heads of [[bounty hunter]]s he had sent to Teth to find his son. Infuriated by the lack of progress, Jabba contacted Chancellor Palpatine and, through his translator droid, [[TC-70]], demanded to know why the Jedi were not searching for his son. The chancellor assured the crime lord that the Jedi were on their way, of which Jabba said the treaty with him depended on.<ref name="TCW-film" />

Kenobi soon arrived at Jabba's Palace and was taken before the Hutt's court. Kenobi told Jabba that Skywalker, who he described as one of the Order's most powerful Jedi, was on his way to Teth to rescue Rotta and that the Jedi would not let the Hutt down. Jabba attached one additional condition to the proposed treaty&mdash;that the Jedi deliver him the kidnapper as well, dead or alive. Jabba also leveled a threat against the Jedi: if they did not succeed, the Separatist leader [[Count]] [[Dooku]] and the Separatist Droid Army would&mdash;still not knowing that Dooku himself was behind the kidnapping, in a plot to turn the Hutt Clan into an enemy of the Republic. Kenobi briefly departed the palace, which was followed by the arrival of Count Dooku himself. The [[Sith Lord]] claimed that it was the Jedi who kidnapped Rotta and that the Jedi were plotting to destroy Jabba. Jabba demanded proof, which Dooku delivered in the form of a manipulated [[Hologram|holographic]] recording allegedly showing Skywalker and Tano, who had found Rotta on Teth, harming the child, when in reality they were caring for it after he had fallen ill. Dooku told the crime lord that the Separatist Droid Army was initiating a rescue mission and would soon deliver the Huttlet to his father. All Dooku asked in return was that Jabba join the Separatist cause.<ref name="TCW-film" />

Dooku's [[Sith]] acolyte, [[Asajj Ventress]], contacted the count, who played her message in front of Jabba and his court. Ventress claimed that Skywalker killed Rotta and was on his way to Tatooine. Jabba questioned why the Jedi would come to Tatooine, to which Dooku said that the Jedi plot had become clear and that Skywalker would soon arrive to kill the crime lord and wipe out the entire Hutt Clan. Dooku promised Jabba that he would personally deal with Skywalker and, despite fighting the Jedi Knight in a lightsaber duel in the desert, Skywalker managed to reach Jabba's Palace. Once there, Skywalker found that Tano, who had Rotta and from whom he had become separated, had not yet reached the palace. Jabba's henchmen drew their weapons on Skywalker, so the Jedi Knight drew his [[Skywalker's lightsaber|lightsaber]] and pointed it at Jabba&mdash;seemingly confirming Dooku's claims. Jabba said that this was proof that Skywalker had arrived to kill him, but the Jedi said he had only come to negotiate. Just as Jabba's henchmen prepared to kill Skywalker, Tano arrived and delivered Rotta to his father.<ref name="TCW-film" />

[[File:Padme talks to Jabba.png|thumb|300px|left|Jabba learns the truth from Senator Amidala]]
Despite the happy reunion with his son, Jabba ordered Skywalker and Tano's execution. They were saved, however, by a message from [[Senator]] [[Padmé Amidala]] of [[Naboo]], who had discovered Ziro's involvement in the plot. Ziro entered the holographic transmission and admitted to conspiring with Dooku to kidnap Rotta and frame the Jedi, so Jabba told the senator that the Hutt Clan would severely punish Ziro. Amidala asked him if the hostilities between Jabba and the Jedi could cease and if he would open his hyperspace lanes to the Republic, to which Jabba agreed. The two sides signed a treaty allowing the Grand Army of the Republic through Jabba's territories, a decision Amidala assured him he would not regret. [[Grand Master]] [[Yoda]] and clone forces soon arrived at Jabba's Palace, signaling a new era of cooperation between the Republic and Jabba the Hutt.<ref name="TCW-film" />

====Eliminating Ziro====
{{Quote|Jabba thanks you for delivering the holo-diary.|TC-70, to Sy Snootles|Hunt for Ziro}}
Later in the war, Jabba was visited by [[Baron]] [[Papanoida]], the [[chairman]] of the moon [[Pantora]], whose daughters, [[Che Amanwe Papanoida]] and [[Chi Eekway Papanoida]], had been kidnapped by [[Greedo]], a bounty hunter in Jabba's employ. The chairman was able to reason with the Hutt crime lord, who, like Papanoida, knew all too well what it was like to have his child be taken from him. Greedo insisted that he was not responsible, but Jabba allowed a blood sample to be taken from his bounty hunter so it could be compared to blood found at the scene of the crime. Greedo admitted to kidnapping the chairman's daughters at the behest of the Separatists, who wanted leverage against the pantorans , and Papanoida was soon reunited with his children.<ref name="Sphere of Influence">{{TCW|Sphere of Influence}}</ref>

Shortly thereafter, the Grand Hutt Council became concerned that Ziro, who was in Galactic Republic custody, was planning on turning over incriminating evidence about the council's illicit activity, as the imprisoned Hutt had a [[Hutt Council records|journal]] secretly hidden on Teth that contained the evidence. Jabba hired bounty hunter [[Cad Bane]] to free Ziro from prison,<ref name="Evil Plans" /> so he could be imprisoned by the Hutt Clan instead.<ref name="Hunt for Ziro">{{TCW|Hunt for Ziro}}</ref> Bane took members of the [[Galactic Senate]] [[Senate hostage crisis|hostage]] inside the [[Senate Building]], offering their safety in return for Ziro's freedom. Chancellor Palpatine refused the demands, but Palpatine soon changed his mind and allowed Ziro to be freed.<ref name="Hostage Crisis">{{TCW|Hostage Crisis}}</ref> Bane brought Ziro to the Grand Hutt Council on [[Nal Hutta]] where Ziro was imprisoned once more, though Jabba himself was not presented. [[Gardulla Besadii the Elder]] instead acted as a representative.<ref name="Hunt for Ziro" />

[[File:Jabba receives the records.png|thumb|300px|right|Sy Snootles hands Ziro's records over to Jabba]]
Jabba instead planned Ziro's elimination. He hired Ziro's old girlfriend, the singer [[Sy Snootles]], to find the records and eliminate Ziro. Snootles freed Ziro from his imprisonment and tricked him into believing that she was on his side, so he brought her to Teth where he planned to recover his records. Once there, however, Snootles killed the crime lord and brought the records to Jabba, who expressed his gratitude for her work.<ref name="Hunt for Ziro" />

====Forced into the Shadow Collective====
{{Quote|The mighty Jabba and the Hutt families have decided to join you.|[[Unidentified translation droid|Jabba's translator droid]]|Eminence (episode)}}
Jabba later found himself roped into the schemes of [[Maul|Darth Maul]], a renegade Sith Lord who hoped to regain the status he lost after his defeat during the [[Battle of Naboo]] over a decade earlier. As part of his plan, Maul formed the [[Shadow Collective]], an alliance between the Mandalorian faction [[Death Watch]] and various elements from the criminal underworld, including [[Black Sun]] and the [[Pyke Syndicate]]. Their goal was to [[Takeover of Mandalore|takeover]] the planet [[Mandalore]] and, despite their combined might, the Shadow Collective still required additional resources, including muscle and supplies, to achieve their goal. To find the resources they needed, they went before the Grand Hutt Council to negotiate an alliance between the Hutt Clan and the Shadow Collective. Maul, his brother [[Savage Opress]], and Death Watch leader [[Pre Vizsla]] met with the Hutt leaders, where Maul negotiated the terms and conditions of the alliance with Jabba himself. The Hutts wanted to know what they could offer and how much their assistance was worth. Maul proposed an exchange: in return for [[Hutt Space]] and everything in its borders, he would spare their lives. Jabba and the Council were dismissive of Maul's threats, which resulted in a skirmish between the Shadow Collective and the Grand Hutt Council's forces. Maul, Opress, and Vizla fought off various enforcers and bounty hunters, until their Death Watch reinforcements arrived. With the additional troops, Maul, Vizla and Opress were able to rout the enemy forces and secure a victory.<ref name="Eminence" />

[[File:Jabba joins the Shadow Collective.png|thumb|300px|left|Jabba is forced into joining the Shadow Collective, though the alliance would not last for long]]
Although the Collective was triumphant, the ensuing conflict and chaos allowed all but one Hutt to escape&mdash;[[Oruba]]. Maul interrogated Oruba, threatening to kill him unless he revealed where the others had escaped to. Under duress, Oruba informed Maul that he could find Jabba in his palace on Tatooine. The Shadow Collective soon arrived, facing little resistance as they made their way into Jabba's court. Maul ordered Jabba and the council to submit to his demands and join the Shadow Collective, lest they suffer his wrath. With little choice in the matter, Jabba agreed to assist the Shadow Collective in its takeover of Mandalore.<ref name="Eminence" /> The resources the Hutt Clan provided aided the Shadow Collective in its successful takeover of Mandalore, with Maul declaring himself the new leader of Mandalore.<ref name="Shades of Reason">{{TCW|Shades of Reason}}</ref> However, the Sith Lord Darth Sidious&mdash;secretly Chancellor Palpatine himself<ref name="Episode III">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref>&mdash;came to regard Maul as a threat and targeted the Shadow Collective.<ref name="The Lawless">{{TCW|The Lawless}}</ref> The group fractured under assault by the Sith and their Separatist puppets, and Maul's plan was resoundingly defeated by Darth Sidious.<ref name="Son of Dathomir 4">''[[Darth Maul—Son of Dathomir, Part Four]]''</ref>

===Age of the Empire===
{{Quote|Jabba, you're a wonderful [[human]] being.|Han Solo, after Jabba extended the time he had to repay his debts|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}
[[File:HanJabbaDockingBay94.png|thumb|300px|right|Jabba and Solo discuss the smuggler's debt in Mos Eisley]]
At the end of the Clone Wars, the Republic was [[Proclamation of the New Order|transformed]] into the [[Galactic Empire]], and the chancellor declared himself [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]].<ref name="Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref> Jabba continued his illicit operations during the [[Imperial Era|Age of the Empire]], continuing to hold influence as a crime lord.<ref name="SW15">''[[Star Wars 15: From the Journals of Old Ben Kenobi]]''</ref>

During a particularly bad [[Great Drought|drought]] on Tatooine, Jabba began collecting a hefty [[water tax]] from local [[moisture farmer]]s. This earned his thugs an unpleasant encounter with Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was watching and protecting a young [[Luke Skywalker]]. When Skywalker attempted to steal the thugs' collections for the day, they caught and threatened to kill him. It was at that moment that Kenobi took down the thugs with [[the Force]]. Under cover of darkness, the gangsters were unable to identify Kenobi. Most displeased with his loss of tax revenue, Jabba hired the [[Wookiee]] bounty hunter [[Black Krrsantan]] to track down and identify the former Jedi Master.<ref name="SW15" />

In [[10 BBY]], the scoundrel [[Tobias Beckett]] came into contact with Jabba and intended to travel to Tatooine to work for him once he decided to leave [[Crimson Dawn]] , but he was killed by [[Han Solo]] at [[Savareen]] before that could come to be.<ref name="Solo">''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]''</ref> As such, Solo was hired by Jabba for his operations, who became the best smuggler on Jabba's payroll.<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" /> Solo's standing was jeopardized, however, when his ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', was boarded by Imperial authorities, forcing Solo to jettison his cargo. Jabba demanded compensation for the lost cargo and, when Solo could not pay, the crime lord sent bounty hunters after him. One such hunter was Greedo, who confronted Solo in a [[Chalmun's Cantina|cantina]] in [[Mos Eisley]], but Solo killed the [[Rodian]] bounty hunter before he could kill Solo. Jabba learned of this and found Solo in [[Docking Bay 94]], where the smuggler said that he had no choice but to dump his cargo. Jabba agreed to give Solo an extension on the payment in exchange for additional interest. Solo accepted the offer, but he soon became involved in the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] and once again failed to pay Jabba.<ref name="Episode IV" /> When Jabba learned that Solo had joined the Rebellion, Jabba placed a large bounty on the smuggler's head.<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" />

Shortly after the [[Battle of Yavin]], in which the Alliance&mdash;with Solo's help&mdash;destroyed the Imperial, planet-destroying [[battle station]] known as the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]],<ref name="Episode IV" /> the Empire was left in dire need of additional military resources. To increase its supply of weapons, the Empire planned to negotiate with an envoy in Jabba's employ on [[Cymoon 1]], in the [[Corellian Industrial Cluster]].<ref name="Star Wars 1">''[[Star Wars 1: Skywalker Strikes]]''</ref> The Sith Lord Darth Vader&mdash;formerly Anakin Skywalker<ref name="Episode III" />&mdash;was tasked as the Imperial negotiator, with the intent of forcing Jabba's envoy in a deal favorable to the Empire. The envoy's vessel was hijacked by the Rebel Alliance, however, and a team of Rebels, including Solo, used it to [[Attack on Cymoon 1|assault]]<ref name="Star Wars 1" /> and destroy [[Weapons Factory Alpha]] on Cymoon 1, leveling another critical defeat against the Empire.<ref name="Darth Vader 1">''[[Darth Vader 1: Vader]]''</ref>

[[File:Vader in Jabbas palace.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Darth Vader arrives in Jabba's court]]
The Emperor ordered Vader to travel to Tatooine and negotiate with Jabba personally. The Sith Lord arrived a day ahead of schedule, using his early arrival to carry out a personal mission in Jabba's Palace. Vader told Jabba that he would return on official Imperial business the next day but, for that moment, he wanted to discuss his own mission. Jabba believed that Vader would attempt to use a [[mind trick]] to force him into doing the Dark Lord's will, but Vader said he would not, as mind tricks were not the way of the Sith. Jabba briefly considered collecting the bounty that the Rebel Alliance placed on Vader's head and throwing him into a [[rancor]] pit beneath his court, but he opted not to once he realized Vader was aware of the trap. Jabba continued his discussions with Vader and incorrectly referred to the Sith Lord as a Jedi, resulting in Vader igniting his [[Darth Vader's lightsaber|lightsaber]] and becoming a target of Jabba's henchmen. The Dark Lord wiped many of the guards out before using the Force to [[Force choke|choke]] Jabba, an attack that left the crime lord more amenable to Vader's demands. With Jabba ready to comply, Vader explained that he needed two of Jabba's best bounty hunters to work on a personal mission. Jabba agreed to the demands and provided him with [[Boba Fett]] and Black Krrsantan.<ref name="Darth Vader 1" />

As promised, Vader returned to Jabba's court the next day to continue the official negotiations on behalf of the Empire. The negotiations concluded with Jabba agreeing to provide the Imperial war machine with whatever resources it required. Jabba requested only that the Emperor pay him well, to which Vader said that the Empire would pay him whatever they felt was appropriate. Additionally, as long as Jabba complied with Imperial demands, the Empire would allow Jabba to continue operating his criminal empire. Jabba convinced Vader to briefly stay on Tatooine for a feast and entertainment in the Sith Lord's honor, and the entertainment proved to be the hunting of wild [[bantha]]. Jabba hosted the Sith Lord on his [[sail barge]], where Jabba inquired as to whether the two bounty hunters had proven themselves useful thus far. Vader stated that their missions would be simple enough: capture an [[Cylo|Imperial agent]] working for the Emperor, and locate the pilot who destroyed the Death Star. Vader also demanded to know everything that Jabba knew about Obi-Wan Kenobi, who lived in [[Exile (punishment)|exile]] on Tatooine for nearly two decades. Jabba told him only that Kenobi had proven to be a thorn in his side in those years.<ref name="Star Wars 4" />

====Slaying of the Hutt====
{{Quote|Jabba, this is your last chance. Free us or die.|Luke Skywalker|Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi}}
Three years after the Battle of Yavin, Fett was once again hired by Darth Vader to track down the ''Millennium Falcon'', which Vader used in his hunt for Luke Skywalker&mdash;whom he had discovered was the pilot who destroyed the Death Star. The resulting capture of the Rebel vessel led to Solo's capture, and he was [[Carbon-freezing|frozen]] in [[carbonite]] as a test to ensure the process would work on Skywalker. Fett was given the frozen smuggler<ref name="Episode V">[[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']]</ref> and brought him to Tatooine, where he collected the bounty Jabba placed on Solo's head.<ref name="Moving Target">''[[Moving Target: A Princess Leia Adventure]]''</ref> Solo was kept encased in carbonite and put on display in Jabba's court, as Jabba believed it was his favorite decoration. Unknown to Jabba at the time was that Solo's friends were plotting his [[Rescue of Han Solo|rescue]], and that one of his friends, [[Lando Calrissian]], had already infiltrated Jabba's Palace and disguised himself as a guard.<ref name="Episode VI" />

[[File:ProdroidJabba.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Jabba rejected Skywalker's proposal and conscripted the droids into his service.]]
The plan was put in place upon the arrival of the protocol droid [[C-3PO]] and [[astromech droid]] [[R2-D2]]. Artoo carried with him a message from Skywalker, who declared himself a Jedi Knight and announced his intention to bargain for Solo's life. The young Jedi said he would arrive soon, and he offered the two droids as a gift for the crime lord. Jabba boasted that there would be no bargain, however, and conscripted the two droids into his service. Threepio became his new translator, while Artoo would serve drinks on Jabba's sail barge. Later, during a performance of the song "[[Jedi Rocks]]" by the [[Max Rebo Band]], Jabba's personal dancer, [[Oola]], attempted to resist his advances toward her, and the Hutt activated the trapdoor and sent her to her death in the rancor pit. The chaotic moment was followed by the arrival of [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Organa]], who, as part of the rescue plan, came disguised as the bounty hunter [[Boushh]] and brought with her [[Chewbacca]], Solo's Wookiee companion, as her "prisoner."<ref name="Episode VI" /> Tipped off by Boba Fett, Jabba knew it was not really Boushh under the helmet, but he thought the imposter was just a short lowlife smuggler.<ref name="Beware">''[[Return of the Jedi: Beware the Power of the Dark Side!]]''</ref> The disguised Organa demanded the bounty on the Wookiee's head and insisted on 50,000 [[credit]]s, which Jabba balked at. Organa threatened him with a [[Thermal detonator|detonator]], leading Jabba to compliment Boushh, and the two came to an agreement of 35,000 credits. Chewbacca was imprisoned in Jabba's dungeons, while Organa waited in the palace so she could free Solo after the court had gone to sleep.<ref name="Episode VI" />

Organa successfully freed Solo from carbonite that evening, but Jabba and his court discovered them. Solo tried to bargain with the crime lord, saying he was on his way to pay Jabba when Fett captured him, but Jabba said it was too late to pay him. The gangster imprisoned Solo and took Organa as his new companion, replacing the deceased Oola. Shortly thereafter, Skywalker finally arrived at the palace and was able to gain entry through the use of a mind trick, despite Jabba's order not to allow the Jedi to enter. Jabba's [[majordomo]], [[Bib Fortuna]], presented the Jedi to his master and Skywalker demanded that Jabba free Solo and his friends, or else face his destruction. Jabba refused and Skywalker pulled a gun on him, at which point Jabba activated the trapdoor and sent Skywalker and a [[Gamorrean]] guard into the rancor pit. The rancor ate the guard but Skywalker was able to kill the beast, infuriating the gangster. As punishment for the outrage, Jabba ordered that Skywalker, Solo, and Chewbacca be executed by being fed to the [[sarlacc]], a creature that dwelled in the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]].<ref name="Episode VI" />

[[File:Leia Kills Jabba ALNL.png|thumb|250px|left|Organa strangles Jabba to death.]]
Jabba and his court traveled to the Great Pit of Carkoon for the execution. As the proceedings were about to begin, Skywalker offered one last opportunity to free them and threatened to kill Jabba if he did not. The crime lord refused and ordered the prisoners into the pit, but Artoo revealed Skywalker's [[Luke Skywalker's green lightsaber|hidden lightsaber]] and the Jedi attacked Jabba's henchmen. The ensuing battle led to chaos on Jabba's sail barge, as his enforcers attempted to kill the Jedi and the Rebels. In the ensuing panic, Organa wrapped the chain she was bound in around Jabba's neck and strangled him to [[death]], bringing an end to the criminal reign of Jabba the Hutt. After his death, Solo and his friends were able to successfully escape, and Jabba's corpse was blown up when his sail barge exploded over the sarlacc pit.<ref name="Episode VI" />

===Legacy===
After Jabba's demise, the Hutt Council was left to determine who would fill Jabba's seat and take reins of his criminal empire. Several months after Solo's rescue, a decision had yet to be made.<ref name="Aftermath">''[[Aftermath]]''</ref> Immediately following Jabba's demise, in order to determine the exact nature of the Hutt's death and settle the debate over the matter of his [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure's will|will]], the Hutt Clan had the wreckage of the ''Khetanna'' examined. What they found was only a holorecording of Organa choking Jabba in his last moments. Most of the circulated copies of this footage and their vendors were hunted down by the Clan to prevent proof of their own vulnerability from circulating.<ref name="Bloodline">''[[Bloodline (novel)|Bloodline]]''</ref>

Many of Jabba's slaves were freed after the battle at Carkoon, leading the prominently enslaved [[Nikto]]s to admire Organa for choking the Hutt, earning her the nickname "Huttslayer".<ref name="Bloodline" /> Over the years following Jabba's death, a [[Huttese]] song known as "[[Jabba Flow]]", composed by the [[Shag Kava]] [[band]], was named after Jabba.<ref name="Hamilton">{{Cite_web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Sagk5uKEtQ|title=Live #Ham4Ham 5/4/16 -- May The Fourth Be With You|accessdate=2017-02-07|date=2016-05-04|format=Video|work=Hamilton: An American Musical|publisher=YouTube}}</ref>

In [[34 ABY]], during his self-imposed exile on [[Ahch-To]], the Jedi Master Luke Skywalker had a [[dream]] where he ignored Organa's message and never joined the rebellion, thus he never caused Jabba's death. In his dream, Jabba was still operating at Tatooine following Skywalker's [[marriage]] to [[Camie Marstrap]] and was still charging water taxes to the moisture farmers.<ref name="The Last Jedi Novel">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: Expanded Edition]]''</ref>

==Personality and traits==
A Hutt crime lord, Jabba Desijilic Tiure was legendary for his vicious temper, endless greed, gruesome appetite and fondness for violent entertainment.<ref name="RotJ junior novel" /> Leader of one of the most famous cartels in the galaxy, Jabba technically controlled Tatooine's underworld.<ref name="Episode IV" />

Despite his ruthless reputation and cruel personality, Jabba neverthless had a lighter side: he loved his son Rotta very much and became furious when he was kidnapped by the Separatists, willing to punish those responsible with death.<ref name="TCW-film" />

==Behind the scenes==
Jabba the Hutt was first mentioned in the [[1977]] film [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]<ref name="Episode IV" /> and was mentioned again in the [[1980]] sequel [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']].<ref name="Episode VI" /> He made his first appearance in [[1983]] in the final film of the [[original trilogy]], [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']],<ref name="Episode VI" /> and he was later added into Episode IV when a previously-deleted scene was restored to the film.<ref name="Special Edition">''[[The Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition]]''</ref>

[[Declan Mulholland]] was cast as Jabba in the deleted scene from the original ''Star Wars'', in which he was depicted as a rotund human dressed in a shaggy fur coat, but the scene was cut as [[George Lucas]] wanted to depict Jabba as an [[Alien]] creature, but the special effects technology of the time was not up to the task of replacing Mulholland.<ref name="Special Edition" /> For ''Return of the Jedi'', Jabba was portrayed by puppeteers [[Toby Philpott]], [[David Barclay]], and [[Mike Edmonds]], and voiced by [[Larry Ward]].<ref name="philpott">{{Cite_web|url=http://starwarsinterviews1.blogspot.com/2010/01/toby-philpott-interview.html|title=Toby Philpott interview - Jabba the Hutt - Star Wars|work=Star Wars Interviews|accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref name="imdb">{{Cite_web|url=http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000111/|title=Jabba the Hutt (Character)|work=IMDB: The Internet Movie Database|accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref> In ''Return of the Jedi'', Jabba's slimy sound was primarily made using a bowl of melted cheese.<ref name="AEYNTK" />

In [[1999]], he appeared in the first chapter of the [[prequel trilogy]], [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']],<ref name="Episode I" /> and made several appearances in the animated television series ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' and the [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|film]],<ref name="Sphere of Influence" /><ref name="Hunt for Ziro" /><ref name="Eminence" /> where he was voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]. George Lucas originally placed off-limits the possibility to use Jabba in the series when writer [[Henry Gilroy]] was writing the show bible, but by the time of the next meeting, Lucas changed his mind and Jabba was allowed to be used in both ''The Clone Wars'' film and the subsequent TV show.<ref>TheForce.net.[http://theforce.net/jedicouncil/interview/henrygilroyanddavefiloni.asp TheForce.net - Jedi Council - Interviews - Cellblock 1138 - Dave Filoni and Henry Gilroy]. Retrieved on [[November 18]], [[2017]].</ref>

A running gag in the ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' TV show involves [[Ezra Bridger]] identifying himself as "Jabba" whenever he wants to keep his real name secret, for example to Imperial officers.<ref name="spark">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion]]''</ref><ref name="stealth">{{Rebels|Stealth Strike}}</ref><ref name="twilight">{{Rebels|Twilight of the Apprentice}}</ref>
