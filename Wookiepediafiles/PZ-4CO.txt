{{Quote|General Organa, I have been requested to assist you in recording your memoirs.|PZ-4CO, to General Leia Organa|Moving Target: A Princess Leia Adventure}}
'''PZ-4CO''', nicknamed "'''Peazy-Fourseeo'''," was a [[protocol droid]] who was designed to resemble the [[Tofallid]] [[species]]. PZ-4CO also served in the [[Resistance]]. During its struggle against the [[First Order]] approximately three [[Standard decade|decades]] after the [[Battle of Endor]]. [[Sexes|She]] served in the [[Resistance base]] control rooms and was a source of tactical data and communications during Resistance operations. As part of her duties, she assisted [[General]] [[Leia Organa]], the leader and symbol of the Resistance, in writing a memoir of the general's time during the [[Galactic Civil War]].

==Biography==
[[File:PZ-4CO full.jpg|thumb|left|180px|PZ-4CO alongside [[Kaydel Ko Connix]] in the Resistance base on D'Qar.]]
PZ-4CO, also nicknamed Peazy, was a [[protocol droid]] who served in the [[Resistance]] during its operations against the [[First Order]] several [[Standard decade|decades]] after the [[Battle of Endor]].<ref name="Moving Target" /> She was stationed in the [[Resistance base]] on [[D'Qar]] and often served in the Resistance control rooms, where she assisted in operations by providing technical data and being a source of communication for Resistance [[officer]]s.<ref name="Databank" />

As part of her duties within the Resistance, Peazy was assigned to assist [[General]] [[Leia Organa]] in the writing of the generalâ€™s memoirs, and she received assistance from Resistance [[Major]] [[Caluan Ematt]] in preparing for the interviews with the [[Prince]]ss of [[Alderaan]]. Although Organa was reluctant to write memoirs, and indeed it took Peazy forty-four [[Standard day|days]] to convince the general to begin the process, Peazy believed it was important to record them, as Organa had been a vital member of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] during the [[Galactic Civil War]]. To begin the process, Organa recounted her experience leading [[Operation Yellow Moon]], a mission that took place shortly before the Battle of [[Endor]], as the general believed its focus on duty would be vital to the members of the Resistance.<ref name="Moving Target" />

==Characteristics==
[[File:PZ-4CO_Moving_Target.png|thumb|157x157px]]
PZ-4CO was a protocol droid with [[Sexes|feminine]] programming, with a female pitched voice. She was a tall [[droid]] and was covered in [[Color|blue]] plates, with red markings across her armor. She was equipped with a [[holorecorder]], which could extend and retract out of and into her torso. She used this recorder to interview General Organa for the general's memoirs, which Peazy believed were important due to Organa's status as a symbol of the Resistance's efforts against the [[First Order]].<ref name="Moving Target" /><ref name="VD">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref>
