{{Quote|Sir, Rebel ships are coming into our sector.''"<br />"''Good. Our first catch of the day.|Lieutenant Cabbel and Captain Lennox, during the Battle of Hoth|Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}
'''Xamuel Lennox''' was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Sexes/Legends|male]] who hailed from a long line of military men. Lennox began his career as a [[Navy/Legends|naval]] [[Officer/Legends|officer]] for the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]] with a noble, proud philosophy, similar to that of his ancestors; he hated the deception and ruthlessness that were commonplace in the [[New Order/Legends|New Order]]. When the Empire became embroiled in a [[The galaxy/Legends|galaxy]]-spanning [[Galactic Civil War/Legends|conflict]] with the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]], Lennox found himself caught between both sides. On the one hand, he saw the Empire as mired with corruption and greed, and on the other, the Rebellion had begun the war and opposed a legitimate government. Despite his conflicted ideology, Lennox finally accepted that corruption was how things would always be. He eventually became a [[Captain/Legends|captain]] in the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]] with the command of the [[Imperial I-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial I''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Rebel Dream|Tyrant]]''. In [[1 BBY/Legends|1 BBY]], Lennox led the ''Tyrant'' and nine other [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer/Legends|Imperial Star Destroyers]] in an [[Battle of Turkana|ambush]] against Rebel forces over the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Turkana/Legends|Turkana]]. The battle ultimately ended in an Imperial retreat, due to the success of the Rebels' new [[T-65 X-wing starfighter]]s against Lennox's combat tactics.

At some point following the battle, Lennox and the ''Tyrant'' were attached to [[Death Squadron/Legends|Death Squadron]], the personal [[Fleet/Legends|battle group]] of the [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]], [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]]. In [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], Lennox and the ''Tyrant'' participated in the [[Battle of Hoth/Legends|Battle of Hoth]]; however, because the [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] was hit by fire from the Rebels' [[planetary ion cannon]] in the early stages of the battle over the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Hoth/Legends|Hoth]], it was unable to assist the Empire until repairs were made. After the ''Tyrant'' was repaired of its ion damage, a [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] brought the captured Rebel [[General/Legends|general]] and former Imperial, [[Crix Madine/Legends|Crix Madine]], aboard so that he could be taken to [[Prison/Legends|prison]]. However, Lennox's [[Prisoner/Legends|incarceration]] of Madine was short lived&mdash;the ''Tyrant'' was hit again by the [[Ion cannon/Legends|ion cannon's]] fire, and Rebel [[Commando/Legends|commandos]] boarded the ship and rescued Madine. Near the end of the battle, when the ''Tyrant'' was functional again, Lennox attempted to recapture Madine by attacking the ''[[Champion (Mon Calamari cruiser)|Champion]]'', a [[Mon Calamari Star Cruiser|Mon Calamari cruiser]] that was evacuating the general from Hoth. Despite Lennox's efforts, the ''Champion'' successfully escaped.

[[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Vader then gave Lennox an [[Occupation of Bespin|assignment]] to go to the [[Bespin system/Legends|Bespin system]] and remove the [[Jedi Diplomat]], [[Rachi Sitra]], from [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]], a [[Tibanna/Legends|tibanna gas]] [[Mining/Legends|mining]] colony floating over the [[Gas giant/Legends|gas giant]] of [[Bespin/Legends|Bespin]]. After reaching the [[Star system/Legends|system]] and overseeing the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi's]] dispatch, Lennox ordered his men to remove Rebel sympathizers from the [[City/Legends|city]]. The assignment was thwarted by [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]], the colony's [[Baron Administrator/Legends|Baron Administrator]], who threw the colony into chaos by telling his people to evacuate. Later in [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]], Lennox and his crew were present at the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]], where [[Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] and Darth Vader were [[Death/Legends|killed]] and the Empire's [[Death Star II/Legends|Death Star II]] [[battlestation]] was destroyed. Several [[Standard year/Legends|years]] later, Lennox was imprisoned when the ''Tyrant'' was captured and renamed the ''Rebel Dream'' by the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]], a government formed from the Rebellion he had opposed.

{{Quote|Move our Star Destroyers within range and launch all TIE Fighter Squadrons.|Captain Lennox during the Battle of Turkana|Star Wars: X-Wing}}
Xamuel Lennox was a [[Human/Legends|Human]] [[Sexes/Legends|male]] who was [[Reproduction/Legends|born]] into a proud legacy of military men. During the early [[Standard day/Legends|days]] of the reign of the [[Galactic Empire/Legends|Galactic Empire]], Lennox joined the [[Imperial Navy/Legends|Imperial Navy]]. At the start of his career, Lennox attempted to follow in his ancestors' footsteps and be an honorable, noble [[Officer/Legends|officer]]. Yet his attitude toward his duty and crew was sharply contrasted to that of the majority of his colleagues, who were content to betray each other and engage in [[Politics/Legends|political]] maneuvering, which Lennox despised. However, Lennox knew that he would not survive long if he continued with his family's traditional philosophy, so despite his intense dislike of such practices, he decided to engage in deceit and political intrigue. By mastering the tactics of deceit, he was able to fend off those who vied for his [[Navy/Legends|Navy]] positions.<ref name="Who" />

In ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing]]'', the Battle of Turkana occurred at the start of the game, with the end of the second tour of duty focusing on the Alliance obtaining the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] [[Death Star plans/Legends|plans]]. Those missions occurred shortly after the [[Battle of Kattada]], which took place in 35:2 GrS&mdash;or 1 BBY&mdash;by its concurrence with the [[Subjugation of Ralltiir]] and that battle's dating in ''[[Galaxywide NewsNets]]''.

These [[Engine/Legends|thrust nozzles]] visually correspond to those found aboard the [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] ''[[Devastator/Legends|Devastator]]'' (seen [[:File:Devastator.jpg|here]] and [http://theforce.net/swtc/Pix/Xbarbican/eydc5/5r22isd.jpg here]), which is confirmed to be an ''Imperial I''-class by ''[[Vader: The Ultimate Guide]]'', as opposed to those found aboard the [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyer]] ''[[Avenger/Legends|Avenger]]'' (seen [[:File:WhoWillTicketVaderForLittering-ESB.jpg|here]] and [http://theforce.net/swtc/Pix/Xbrooklyn/Isd31.jpg here]), which is confirmed to be an [[Imperial II-class Star Destroyer/Legends|''Imperial II''-class Star Destroyer]] by ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing Alliance]]''.</ref> ''[[Rebel Dream|Tyrant]]''.<ref name="Who" /> That [[Standard year/Legends|year]],<ref name="Turkana date" /> Lennox was in command of Imperial naval operations in the [[Pakuuni sector]] and was ordered by the [[Unidentified Pakuuni sector governor|sector governor]] to lead ten [[Star Destroyer/Legends|Star Destroyers]] against [[Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends|Alliance to Restore the Republic]] [[Warship/Legends|warships]] [[Orbit/Legends|orbiting]] the [[Planet/Legends|planet]] [[Turkana/Legends|Turkana]]. Before dropping his [[Fleet/Legends|fleet]] out of [[Hyperspace/Legends|hyperspace]], Lennox used a group of [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighters]] to verify the Rebels' presence. Using [[Formation Besh]], [[Attack Pattern Tartarus]] to keep the Rebels from escaping, Lennox had the ''Tyrant'' serve as the lead [[Starship/Legends|ship]], with Captain [[Firmus Piett/Legends|Firmus Piett]] providing support from the Star Destroyer ''[[Accuser]]''. While the Star Destroyers engaged the Rebels' [[Mon Calamari Star Cruiser|Mon Calamari Cruisers]] and other [[Capital ship/Legends|capital ships]] at long range, the fleet's [[TIE/sa bomber/Legends|TIE bombers]] attacked the [[Engine/Legends|engines]] on the Rebel [[Cruiser/Legends|cruisers]], while being protected by [[TIE/LN starfighter|TIE fighters]] and [[TIE/IN interceptor/Legends|interceptors]]. However, the Rebels launched their own starfighters, including two [[Squadron/Legends|squadrons]] of the Rebel's new [[T-65 X-wing starfighter]]s. Despite warnings from Piett, Lennox stayed with his original tactics, which led to the Imperial starfighters taking heavy casualties. While Piett's orders made it possible to destroy some of the attacking starfighters, the Rebels still dealt serious damage to at least two of the Star Destroyers, without any of the Rebel capital ships being destroyed. Lennox ordered his fleet to jump to hyperspace and regroup at [[Pakuuni]], but his defeat at what became known as the [[Battle of Turkana]] resulted in Captain Piett recommending his removal from command of naval operations in the Pakuuni sector.<ref name="Imperial Handbook" />

Under the command of Lennox, the ''Tyrant'' became part of [[Death Squadron/Legends|Death Squadron]] after the destruction of the Empire's [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station/Legends|Death Star]] at the [[Battle of Yavin/Legends|Battle of Yavin]]. Death Squadron was the personal battle group of [[Anakin Skywalker/Legends|Darth Vader]],<ref name="Who" /> a [[Dark Lord of the Sith/Legends|Dark Lord of the Sith]] and one of the most powerful men in the Empire.<ref name="ESB" /> Lennox was an able leader<ref name="CCG">{{CCG|set=Hoth Limited|link=Hoth-Dark/large/captainlennox.gif|cardname=Captain Lennox}}</ref> and cunning tactician, earning his position through merit alone,<ref name="Who" /> but he was also very dedicated to his crew and ship,<ref name="BtM">''[[Star Wars: Behind the Magic]]''</ref> caring about their wellbeing more than his own political advancement.<ref name="CCG2">{{TCG|set=Return of the Jedi (TCG)|link=http://wizards.com/swtcg/swtcg_autocard.asp?name=Captain%5BLennox%5B(A)|cardname=Captain Lennox (A)}}</ref> Despite his dedication, Lennox was disillusioned with the Empire and [[Imperial Military/Legends|military]] life due to the dishonorable means to which he resorted to keep his captaincy safe. While he had serious qualms about the corruption and lack of moral principles of the Empire he served, he despised the Alliance to Restore the Republic and knew that the [[Galactic Republic/Legends|Galactic Republic]] before it was every bit as corrupt as the Empire. Ultimately, Lennox decided that deceit and corruption were the natural order of things.<ref name="Who" />

===Battle of Hoth===
====Starting the battle====
{{Quote|All stations, prepare to fire on my mark.|Captain Lennox giving orders to fire on the ''Quantum Storm''|Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Warfare Author's Cut}}
[[File:Tyrant-disabled.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The disabled ''Tyrant'' was unable to stop the Rebels escaping during the Battle of Hoth.]]
In [[3 ABY/Legends|3 ABY]], Imperial [[Viper probe droid/Legends|Viper probe droids]] were launched from the Star Destroyers of Death Squadron to search throughout [[The galaxy/Legends|the galaxy]] for the location of the Alliance's headquarters. The squadron was near the [[Qeimet system]]<ref name="Atlas">''[[The Essential Atlas]]''</ref> when a [[Probe droid/Legends|probe droid]] discovered the Rebel [[Echo Base/Legends|base]] on the planet [[Hoth/Legends|Hoth]] in the [[Anoat sector/Legends|Anoat sector]]. Using the information, [[Darth/Legends|Darth]] Vader ordered the fleet's course to be set for the [[Hoth system/Legends|Hoth system]],<ref name="ESB" /> taking a series of hyperspace jumps to travel there.<ref name="Atlas" /> When Death Squadron arrived in the [[Star system/Legends|system]], the Rebels activated their [[Deflector shield/Legends|energy shield]] over Hoth, but the Imperials continued with their attack, landing a [[Ground warfare|ground assault]] to bring down the Rebels' [[Deflector shield generator/Legends|shield generator]].<ref name="ESB" /> The ''Tyrant'' was positioned at the front of Death Squadron's formation as one of six Star Destroyers making up a heavy attack line that was backed up by the ''[[Executor/Legends|Executor]]'',<ref name="Author's Cut">{{SW|url=news/the-essential-guide-to-warfare-authors-cut-part-11-serving-the-empire|int=Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Warfare Author's Cut|text=''Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Warfare'' Author's Cut, Part 11: Serving the Empire|archivedate=20170419191659}}</ref> Darth Vader's [[Flagship/Legends|personal command ship]]. As the Imperial ground forces began their [[Battle of Hoth/Legends|attack]], Lennox and the ''Tyrant'' moved into position to intercept the Rebel's [[GR-75 medium transport/Legends|GR-75 medium transports]] and their [[Starfighter/Legends|starfighter]] escorts as they attempted to evacuate rebel personnel from the surface.<ref name="ESB" />

Lennox was on the [[Bridge (starship)/Legends|bridge]] of the ''Tyrant'' when his [[Executive officer/Legends|first officer]], [[Lieutenant/Legends|Lieutenant]] [[Cabbel/Legends|Cabbel]], informed him that the first Rebel [[Transport/Legends|transport]],<ref name="ESB" /> named the ''[[Quantum Storm/Legends|Quantum Storm]]'',<ref name="GG3">''[[Galaxy Guide 3: The Empire Strikes Back]]''</ref> and its [[T-65 X-wing starfighter]] escorts were approaching the ''Tyrant''{{'s}} position. Eager to engage the Rebels, Lennox prepared to attack, but the Rebels had a large planetary [[V-150 Planet Defender/Legends|ion cannon]] stationed near the base, which fired two shots that hit the ''Tyrant''.<ref name="ESB" /> While the [[Com-scan|Com-Scan]] aboard the ''Tyrant'' was able to pick up the power fluctuations caused by the [[Ion cannon/Legends|ion cannon]] firing, Lennox and the rest of the ship's crew were unable to react quickly enough for the ''Tyrant'' to evade the attack.<ref name="Author's Cut" /> The ion blasts disabled the Star [[Destroyer/Legends|Destroyer's]] [[Deflector shield/Legends|shields]] and helm control,<ref name="ESB Radio">[[The Empire Strikes Back (radio)|''The Empire Strikes Back'' radio drama]]</ref> which allowed the Rebel ships to escape.<ref name="ESB" /> The ion cannon also affected Lennox's [[myoelectric hip replacement]], which caused his [[Limb/Legends|foot]] to tap wildly. While the Rebels had insufficient ships to destroy the ''Tyrant'', and the ship's trajectory did not place it on a collision course with Hoth, the ion damage eventually caused the Star Destroyer's [[Artificial gravity generator/Legends|artificial gravity]] and other main systems to fail, causing an unusual quiet to fall over the ship. While the ''Tyrant'' was disabled, the ''[[Emancipator|Accuser]]'' took the ship's position in Death Squadron's attack line.<ref name="Author's Cut" /> The disabled systems put Lennox's and the ''Tyrant'' out of the battle temporarily, but the Star Destroyer's crew were able to repair the ship before it ended.<ref name="TPOV">{{SWGTCG|set=The Price of Victory}}</ref>

====The hunt for General Madine====
{{Quote|We're blind. We could be boarded by a Rebel ship at any minute.|Captain Xamuel Lennox, after the ''Tyrant'' was hit by an ion cannon during the Battle of Hoth|The Price of Victory}}
[[File:Captain Lennox SWG-TPOV.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Captain Lennox during his attack on the ''Champion'']]
During the battle on the surface, Imperial [[Troop/Legends|troops]] captured a Rebel Alliance [[General/Legends|general]] and former Imperial named [[Crix Madine/Legends|Crix Madine]] and sent him to the ''Tyrant'' via a [[Shuttle/Legends|shuttle]] so that he could be sent to [[Prison/Legends|prison]] on the planet [[Dathomir/Legends|Dathomir]]. After the shuttle entered the ''Tyrant''{{'s}} [[Hangar/Legends|docking bay]], Captain Lennox ordered one of the Imperial [[Trooper/Legends|troops]] to come to the bridge and report to him on the status of the battle. During the report, the ''Tyrant'' was hit by another blast from the [[planetary ion cannon]]. While overseeing the repair of systems disabled by the [[Ion cannon/Legends|ion cannon]], Lennox ordered the reporting [[Soldier/Legends|soldier]] to ensure that Madine was secure in the ship's brig. A short time afterward, Rebel [[Commando/Legends|commandos]] boarded the ship, rescued Madine, and escaped back to Hoth with the Rebel general on<ref name="TPOVDSC">{{SWGTCG|set=The Price of Victory|scenario=Dark Side scenario campaign}}</ref> a [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle/Legends|''Lambda''-class shuttle]]<ref name="TPOVLSC">{{SWGTCG|set=The Price of Victory|scenario=Light Side scenario campaign}}</ref> that they stole from the docking bay. Captain Lennox was unable to pursue the shuttle due to the ion damage the ''Tyrant'' had suffered.<ref name="TPOVDSC" /> Although Lennox's [[Warship/Legends|warship]] was left to float through the [[Star system/Legends|system]], and several more Rebel transports subsequently escaped, the Battle of Hoth proved a resounding victory for the Empire and kept the Rebels on the run.<ref name="ESB" />

Later, a shuttle brought Madine to the [[Mon Calamari/Legends|Mon Calamari]] [[Star Cruiser/Legends|Cruiser]] ''[[Champion (Mon Calamari cruiser)|Champion]]'', which then prepared to jump to hyperspace. Lennox engaged the cruiser with the now functional ''Tyrant'', and ordered the launch of the ship's [[TIE Series|TIE fighters]] in preparation for [[Space warfare|battle]]. Lennox hailed the ''Champion'' to say that if they handed over Madine he would call off his attack. The [[Unidentified Rebel captain|captain]] of the ''Champion'' refused and ordered the launch of his ship's fighters. Lennox and the ''Tyrant'' were unable to defeat the ''Champion'' and its fighters, and the ship escaped.<ref name="TPOVLSC" />

===Mission to Bespin===
{{Quote|Go to the Bespin system. Remove a Jedi diplomat who undermines the Empire's negotiations on Cloud City. You failed to capture the traitor. Do not fail me again.|Darth Vader, assigning Captain Lennox and the ''Tyrant'' to remove the Jedi diplomat Rachi Sitra from Cloud City|The Price of Victory}}
Afterward, Darth Vader sent a communication that gave Lennox a new [[Occupation of Bespin|assignment]]. Lennox received the message in his [[Ready Room|ready room]] with one of the Imperial soldiers who had originally captured Madine. Darth Vader assigned the ''Tyrant'' to leave for the [[Bespin system/Legends|Bespin system]], where he would dispatch [[Rachi Sitra]], a [[Jedi Diplomat]] who was making trouble for Imperial negotiations with officials on [[Cloud City/Legends|Cloud City]], a [[Tibanna/Legends|tibanna gas]] [[Mining/Legends|mining]] colony floating over the [[Gas giant/Legends|gas giant]] [[Bespin/Legends|Bespin]]. Vader ended the message warning Lennox not to fail again, and Lennox assigned the Imperial soldier to lead the attack on the [[Jedi/Legends|Jedi]]. After two [[Time/Legends|days]] the ''Tyrant'' reached the Bespin system, and the Imperial soldier took a number of troops in a shuttle to Cloud [[City/Legends|City]]. There, the soldier was able to force Sitra to flee from Cloud City in an [[Eta-2 Actis-class interceptor|Actis interceptor]].<ref name="TPOVDSC" />

The soldier alerted Lennox of the success via a message, and the Captain ordered the operative to remove Rebel sympathizers from Cloud City's lower levels, giving the soldier locations to search and names of suspected sympathizers. However, before the soldier could investigate any suspects, [[Lando Calrissian/Legends|Lando Calrissian]], the [[Baron Administrator/Legends|Baron Administrator]] of Cloud City, advised the people of the colony to evacuate. During the chaos that followed, the soldier captured [[Lobot/Legends|Lobot]], Calrissian's [[Aide/Legends|aide]], and kept Rebel commandos from rescuing the Rebel captain and [[Smuggler/Legends|smuggler]], [[Han Solo/Legends|Han Solo]], whom Darth Vader had ordered [[Carbon-freezing/Legends|frozen]] in [[Carbonite/Legends|carbonite]] and handed over to the [[Bounty hunter/Legends|bounty hunter]], [[Boba Fett/Legends|Boba Fett]]. When Lennox debriefed the operative, he praised the soldier's removal of the Jedi and their work in keeping the Rebels from rescuing Solo. Lennox assured the soldier that the Empire would provide another assignment.<ref name="TPOVDSC" />

===The Battle of Endor and beyond===
After his assignment to Bespin,<ref name="TPOVDSC" /> Lennox retained his post as captain of the ''Tyrant'' and continued to serve as part of Death Squadron until<ref name="BtM" /> [[4 ABY/Legends|4 ABY]]. That year,<ref name="NEC">''[[The New Essential Chronology]]''</ref> the ''Tyrant''<ref name="BtM" /> was part of the Imperial fleet that participated in the [[Battle of Endor/Legends|Battle of Endor]]. The Rebels staged a daring assault on the [[Death Star II/Legends|second]] [[Death Star/Legends|Death Star]], where the [[Alliance Fleet/Legends|Alliance Fleet]] was able to destroy the [[battlestation]] over the [[Endor/Legends|forest moon]] of the planet [[Endor (planet)/Legends|Endor]]. Vader and [[Galactic Emperor/Legends|Emperor]] [[Palpatine/Legends|Palpatine]] were also killed, leaving the Empire bereft of leadership.<ref name="ROTJ">[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]</ref> The battle continued for a time, until [[Gilad Pellaeon]], the captain of the Star Destroyer ''[[Chimaera/Legends|Chimaera]]'', ordered the remnants of the Imperial fleet, including the ''Tyrant'', to retreat.<ref name="HttE">''[[Heir to the Empire]]''</ref>

Several years later, shortly after the [[Bacta War]] of [[7 ABY/Legends|7 ABY]], Lennox's ''Tyrant'' was captured by the Rebel Alliance's successor, the [[New Republic/Legends|New Republic]].<ref name="NEC" /> With Lennox [[Prisoner/Legends|imprisoned]],<ref name="TCSWE" /> the New Republic renamed his ship ''Rebel Dream'' and made it the flagship of [[Prince/Legends|Princess]] [[Leia Organa Solo|Leia Organa]].<ref name="NEC" /> The ''Rebel Dream'' was still in service by the end of the [[Yuuzhan Vong War]]<ref name="TUF">''[[The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force]]''</ref> in [[29 ABY/Legends|29 ABY]],<ref name="TERC">''[[The Essential Reader's Companion]]''</ref> many years after its capture.<ref name="TUF" />

[[File:Lennox_Cabbel.jpg|225px|thumb|right|Lennox and his first officer on the ''Tyrant'' at the Battle of Hoth]]
Xamuel Lennox believed himself to be an honorable man and attempted to follow in the footsteps of his forefathers as a dedicated and loyal captain. After proving himself to be an adept tactician<ref name="Who" /> and capable leader, he was given command of his own ship and crew. Lennox genuinely cared about and was totally dedicated to the ''Tyrant'' and its crew, a view that many of his peers did not share.<ref name="CCG" /><ref name="SWE">''[[Star Wars Encyclopedia]]''</ref> When his subordinates were successful in their assignments, Lennox complemented them on their success.<ref name="TPOVDSC" /> He hated that the Empire had become mired with corruption, backstabbing, and political maneuvering during his time, unlike the noble regimes his ancestors had served in the past. However, Lennox knew that if he attempted to rise above the Empire's corruption without others doing the same, he would end up swept away by the Imperial war machine, just like the Galactic Republic had been. With this frame of mind, Lennox decided to play his foes at their own game, proving as adept at guile and deception as he was at commanding a Star Destroyer. Despite his command abilities,<ref name="Who" /> Lennox's tactics during the Battle of Turkana and his refusal to listen to the recommendations of Captain Piett led to the Empire's defeat during the battle. Ultimately, his refusal to change tactics during the battle led Piett to recommend his removal from command of Imperial naval forces in the Pakuuni sector.<ref name="Imperial Handbook" />

However, the numerous dishonorable deeds that Lennox committed to keep himself in the captain's chair took a significant toll on his conscience. By the time the Rebels launched their campaign against the Empire<ref name="Who" /> in [[2 BBY/Legends|2 BBY]],<ref name="TFUNovel">''[[The Force Unleashed (novel)]]''</ref> Lennox had grown considerably disillusioned with the manner in which the Empire operated. Although he saw many faults in the Empire, Lennox believed that the Rebel Alliance was even more flawed. Since they had started the Galactic Civil War, in Lennox's opinion, the [[Blood/Legends|blood]] of the dead was on their hands. Additionally, he knew that the Republic that they championed and wished to re-establish was just as riddled with corruption as the Empire against which they spoke out. Lennox viewed the Alliance as immoral and hypocritical, while he perceived the Empire as depraved and unethical. In the belief that a more suitable government would never exist, Lennox sided with the Empire, which he saw as legitimate, and helped fight against the Rebels.<ref name="Who" /> By the time of the Battle of Hoth, Lennox was familiar with planetary ion cannon emplacements and other ion weaponry. While some potential recruits entering the Imperial Navy disliked the constant noise aboard a starship, he did not mind it and even missed the sound while not on a ship.<ref name="Author's Cut" /> Lennox had [[Color/Legends|brown]] [[Hair/Legends|hair]] and fair skin.<ref name="ESB" />

==Equipment==
As an Imperial captain, Lennox wore the standard gray Imperial Navy officer uniform.<ref name="ESB" /> By the Battle of Hoth, he had received a myoelectric hip replacement that was susceptible to ion damage.<ref name="Author's Cut" />

===''The Empire’s Finest''===
{{Quote|In any case, I did write the BTS part of Lennox's section, and the Piett/Needa gaffe is indeed mine.|Abel G. Peña|Wookieepedia:Interview/Abel G. Peña}}
In [[2007]], Lennox was featured in ''[[The Empire's Finest: Who's Who in the Imperial Military]]'', an article appearing in ''[[Star Wars Insider 96]]'' that was written by to [[Daniel Wallace]] and [[Abel G. Peña]]. The article added a large amount to Lennox's backstory, including his first name,<ref name="Who" /> and was originally written in 2002 to be released in conjunction with Peña and Wallace's ''[[Who's Who: Imperial Grand Admirals]]'' for ''[[Star Wars Gamer]]'' magazine. When ''Star Wars Gamer'' stopped production, the articles were transferred to ''[[Star Wars Insider]]'', and the magazine's editor decided to publish ''Who's Who: Imperial Grand Admirals'' while cancelling ''The Empire’s Finest''.<ref name="email">[[Wookieepedia:Interviews/Abel G. Peña|Response to fan email by Abel G. Peña]]</ref>

Before ''The Empire’s Finest'' was published in 2007, Peña and Wallace revised the original document while preparing the article for release. One change involved Lennox's first name, which Abel G. Peña had originally intended to be "Corazon," the Spanish word for "heart." Peña felt that it tied into Lennox's character and his conflicting inner feelings about the Empire and the Rebellion. However, in 2007, Peña decided that using names that have a meaning in another language had already been used too much and decided to assign Lennox with another first name. He eventually named the character "Xamuel," a play on [[Wikipedia:Samuel Adams|Samuel Adams]], though Peña admitted that at the time he was thinking of [[Wikipedia:Boston Beer Company|Samuel Adams beer]].<ref name="email" />

The article also mentioned that there was initially some confusion among fans about Lennox's only line in the film, which is often erroneously attributed to Firmus Piett. Although Lennox's face was not fully visible when he spoke, his voice was much different than Piett's. ''Insider'' claims that part of the confusion was due to the fact that the movie novelization assigned the line to Piett,<ref name="Who" /> although in the novelization actually gave the line to Needa.<ref name="ESBn" />

[[2010|Three years after]] ''The Empire's Finest'', Captain Lennox was featured in some of the mission texts for both the [[Light side of the Force/Legends|light side]] and [[Dark side of the Force/Legends|dark side]] campaigns in ''[[The Price of Victory]]'', the eighth set of the ''[[Star Wars Galaxies Trading Card Game]]''. He also featured as the player's opposing avatar card in the third scenario of the light side campaign. This card was simply used in the game for this scenario and was not available for players to use.<ref name="TPOV" /> The Imperial soldier mentioned in the article above was the player character in the dark side scenario campaign for ''The Price of Victory''.<ref name="TPOVDSC" /> A story featuring Lennox was also at one point written by [[Jason Fry]] for ''[[The Essential Guide to Warfare]]'', though it did not make it into the final book due to editing decisions. However, in [[2014]], the story was released on [[StarWars.com]] in the eleventh installment of [[Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Warfare Author's Cut|''Star Wars: The Essential Guide to Warfare'' Author's Cut]], which presented various material cut from the book.<ref name="Author's Cut" />

In [[1993]], ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing]]'', a video game by [[Totally Games]], used a modified shot of Lennox and Cabbel taken from ''The Empire Strikes Back'' in its introductory cutscene. However, the game did not make it clear if Lennox was the character in the cutscene.<ref name="X-Wing">''[[Star Wars: X-Wing]]''</ref> The ambiguity was resolved in ''[[Star Wars: Imperial Handbook: A Commander's Guide]]'', a reference book written by Daniel Wallace in 2014, which mentioned Lennox in an [[in-universe]] account of the Battle of Turkana<ref name="Imperial Handbook" />&mdash;the same battle featured in X-Wing's introductory cutscene.<ref name="X-Wing" /> While the ''Imperial Handbook'' did confirm Lennox's appearance in ''X-Wing'',<ref name="Imperial Handbook" /> Cabbel cannot be the other character as the Battle of Turkana occurred in 1 BBY,<ref name="Turkana date" /> and he was previously stated to be a recent graduate of an Imperial [[Officer's Candidate School]] at the time of the Battle of Hoth,<ref name="Cabbel">{{CCG|set=Hoth Limited|link=hoth/ds/lieutenantcabbel.gif|cardname=Lieutenant Cabbel}}</ref> which occurred in 3 ABY.<ref name="Atlas" />

In [[2012]], a character with a similar appearance to Lennox was featured in ''[[Crimson Empire III: Empire Lost]]'' ''[[Crimson Empire III: Empire Lost 5|5]]'', a comic written by [[Mike Richardson]], illustrated by [[Paul Gulacy]] and [[Michael Bartolo]], and published by [[Dark Horse Comics]]. The nameless character appeared as part of the [[Council of Moffs]] and was referred to as a commander in the dialogue. The scene the officer appeared in took place on the planet [[Orinda/Legends|Orinda]]<ref name="CrimsonEmpireIII">''[[Crimson Empire III: Empire Lost 5]]''</ref> in [[13 ABY]],<ref name="CEDate">{{SWArchive|url=vault/books/crimsonempire3/index.html|text=Back in the Red: Dark Horse Comics Announces Long-Awaited Crimson Empire III Series}}</ref> where Admiral Pellaeon called a meeting of the council to discuss a treaty with the New Republic. However, that purpose was dropped when the council believed that the New Republic was responsible for the death of [[Feena D'Asta]], the daughter of the Imperial [[Baron/Legends|Baron]] [[Ragez D'Asta]]. The commander objected to retaliation, because he believed that potentially weakening the Imperial fleet was a mistake after the Empire's losses while [[Battle of Pallaxides|fighting]] the New Republic at the planet [[Pallaxides]]. Despite the commander's objection, Admiral Pellaeon and the council chose to strike back against the New Republic.<ref name="CrimsonEmpireIII" />
