{{Quote|You wonder why I keep a rabid cur in such a place of power? A cur's weakness, properly manipulated, can be a sharp tool.|Snoke, on Armitage Hux, to Kylo Ren|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}
'''Armitage Hux''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] [[general]] in the [[First Order]] [[First Order military|military]] during the [[cold war]] and subsequent [[First Order–Resistance war|conflict]] with the [[Resistance]]. A member of [[High Command (First Order)|High Command]], Hux answered directly to the First Order's ruler, [[Supreme Leader]] [[Snoke]], granting him far greater authority than his [[Military rank|rank]] would indicate. He was a young, ruthless [[First Order officer|military officer]] who rose through the chain-of-command but his ambitions extended far beyond his present status. Believing he was destined to rule [[the galaxy]], Hux longed to see the [[Standard day|day]] when his technological innovations brought about the fall of the [[New Republic]] and the Resistance, allowing the [[First Order army|armies]] of the First Order to establish an era of military rule not seen since the [[Imperial Era|Age]] of the [[Galactic Empire]].

[[Reproduction|Born]] around the [[time]] of the [[Battle of Yavin]] in [[0 BBY]]/[[0 ABY]], Hux was the [[Hux family|illegitimate son]] of [[Commandant]] [[Brendol Hux]], an [[Imperial Academy]] [[instructor]] who sired Armitage with a [[Armitage Hux's mother|kitchen woman]]. In the [[Standard year|years]] following the Empire's [[Battle of Jakku|defeat]] in the [[Galactic Civil War]], the younger Hux followed in his [[Parent|father's]] footsteps by becoming an [[officer]] as well as a proponent for the training of [[soldier]]s who were [[Project Resurrection|conscripted at birth]]. As a result, Hux oversaw the rise of a [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|new generation of stormtroopers]], the training of which drew inspiration from the [[Galactic Republic|Republic]] [[clone trooper]]s and the original [[stormtrooper]]s. In addition to an [[army]] programmed for absolute loyalty, Hux revived another [[Tarkin Doctrine|idea]] behind [[New Order|Imperial doctrine]]&mdash;establishing military superiority through technological terror, this [[time]] in the form of the [[planet]]-[[Death|killing]] [[superweapon]] known as [[Starkiller Base]].

The [[New Republic Era|era of the New Republic]] ended in [[34 ABY]]; with Starkiller Base operational, Hux persuaded Snoke to authorize its use against the [[Core Worlds|Core World]] [[Hosnian Prime]]. Both the planet and its neighboring worlds in the [[Hosnian system]] were [[Hosnian Cataclysm|annihilated]] by the power of Starkiller, resulting in the destruction of the Republic [[capital]], the [[Galactic Senate (New Republic)|Galactic Senate]], and [[New Republic home fleet|a large portion]] of the [[New Republic Defense Fleet]]. Although the base was lost in a subsequent [[Battle of Starkiller Base|battle]] with the Resistance, Hux was confident that, without the Republic, the [[galaxy]] would fall to the military might of the First Order. Although Hux secretly aspired to succeed Snoke as Supreme Leader, his plans were obstructed by the accession of his rival [[Kylo Ren]], a [[Dark side of the Force|dark]] [[Knights of Ren|warrior]] who seized power in the aftermath of Snoke's [[Attack on the Resistance fleet|assassination]]. Hux initially opposed Ren's claim on the [[throne]], but was forced to pledge his allegiance to him after the new Supreme Leader almost [[Force choke|asphyxiated]] the general by way of [[the Force]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Quote|He has a child&mdash;a bastard boy, as I understand. Not born of his wife, Maratelle, but of some&hellip;kitchen woman.|Gallius Rax, on Armitage Hux's conception|Aftermath: Life Debt}}
[[File:Brendol Hux.png|thumb|left|275x275px|Brendol Hux sired a bastard son, whom he named Armitage Hux, with a kitchen woman.]]
Armitage Hux<ref name="LD">''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]''</ref> was [[Reproduction|born]] on the [[planet]] [[Arkanis]]<ref name="CEUE" /> around the [[time]] of the [[Battle of Yavin]], approximately [[0 BBY]]/[[0 ABY]], during the [[Imperial Era|reign]] of the [[Galactic Empire]].<ref name="Hux Age" /> [[Commandant]] [[Brendol Hux]] was his [[Parent|father]], although Brendol's [[Marriage|wife]], [[Maratelle Hux]] was not his mother, making Armitage the bastard son of Brendol&mdash;a consequence of an extramarital affair between his father and a [[Armitage Hux's mother|kitchen woman]].<ref name="LD" /> Even as a [[Youngling|child]], Armitage harbored notions of grandeur, believing it was his destiny to rule [[the galaxy]].<ref name="Visual Dictionary">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> His father, on the other hand, had a low opinion of Armitage, whom he regarded as a frail and weak-willed boy.<ref name="LD" /> Knowing that Brendol disliked his own son, [[Grand Admiral]] [[Rae Sloane]] suspected that Armitage was abused psychologically and even physically by his father.<ref name="Empire's End" />

Armitage was living on Arkanis when the [[New Republic military|armed forces]] of the [[New Republic]] [[Siege of Arkanis|besieged]] his [[homeworld]]<ref name="LD" /> in [[5 ABY]],<ref name="Life Debt date">{{LifeDebtdate}}</ref> attempting to secure control of the [[Arkanis system]]. At the behest of [[Fleet Admiral]] [[Gallius Rax]], Sloane ensured that neither Armitage or Brendol became [[prisoner]]s of the Republic. She therefore employed the services of the [[bounty hunter]] [[Mercurial Swift]] to facilitate their evacuation before Arkanis fell to the Republic.<ref name="LD" /> Unknown to the Grand [[Admiral]], Rax was in the process of carrying out the [[Contingency]]&mdash;a secret plan devised by the [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] to [[Operation: Cinder|destroy]] the Empire in the [[Battle of Endor|event]] of his [[death]]. Rax also intended to see the Empire reborn in the [[Unknown Regions]], and therefore, regarded the [[Hux family|Huxes]], Armitage in particular, as valuable assets in his plans for the future.<ref name="Empire's End" />

===Fall of the Empire===
{{Quote|You will lead these children. They will serve you. And one day soon your father will pass down his teachings to you, and you will learn to do what he did. It will be your life's work to take children like these savages and hammer their malleable minds into whatever shape you so require. They will be tools built for the work at hand. This is my gift to you, boy. One day your father will die. One day soon, I fear. And you will take his place.|Gallius Rax, to Armitage Hux|Aftermath: Empire's End}}
[[File:Rebellion Arrives at Jakku.png|thumb|right|286x286px|Counselor Gallius Rax summoned Hux and his father to Jakku, where the Empire made its final stand against the New Republic.]]
Following the [[Attack on Chandrila]], Armitage followed his father Brendol to the planet [[Jakku]]. Gallius Rax had proclaimed himself [[Counselor to the Empire]] and brought the Imperial remnants to the desolate world for a final showdown against the New Republic. In the months leading up to the [[Battle of Jakku]], Armitage kept away from Brendol, who physically and psychologically mistreated him. Brendol trained 24 local orphans into Rax's personal guard of [[Gallius Rax's child soldiers|child soldiers]].<ref name="Empire's End" />

After the Battle of Jakku had commenced, Armitage traveled with his father, Counselor Rax, the Adviser [[Yupe Tashu]], and the child soldiers aboard a transport to the [[Jakku Observatory]]. The Observatory was a secret facility in the [[Plaintive Hand plateau]] which was instrumental to the later [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine's]] [[Contingency]] plan. Rax planned to detonate the planet Jakku along with the New Republic and Imperial forces. He planned to take Armitage and his father Brendol into the [[Unknown Regions]] to rebuild the Empire.<ref name="Empire's End" />

[[File:Battle of Jakku.jpg|thumb|left|275x275px|The Battle of Jakku precipitated an Imperial exodus to the Unknown Regions, where Hux and his father would oversee the Empire's rebirth as the First Order.]]
During the journey to the Observatory, Hux found himself alone in the transport hold with the child soldiers. Hux was intimidated by the older children, who had been trained into ruthless killers by his father. Counselor Rax then entered the room and asked Armitage if his father had explained anything to him. Armitage confirmed that this was not the case and indicated that his father did not like him. Taking pity on Armitage, Rax told the boy that he, his father, and the other children would be traveling far away. Rax also hinted that Armitage would have a special destiny to play in the future.<ref name="Empire's End" />

Gallius Rax informed Armitage that he was giving him command of the child soldiers as a gift. Rax told Armitage that he would succeed his father in training the children into tools of warfare. Rax then addressed the child soldiers and instructed them they were bound to serve Armitage and should be willing to give their lives for him. Armitage thanked Counselor Rax, who told the boy that the future of the Empire needed him. After Rax had exited the transport hold, Armitage ordered one of the boys, who had dark hair and freckled skin, to strike his comrade, a lad with sandy hair and sallow cheeks.<ref name="Empire's End" />

[[File:Admiral Sloane-SWGA.jpg|thumb|right|261x261px|Grand Admiral Rae Sloane befriended and protected Hux from his father Brendol.]]
After landing at the Jakku Observatory, Rax instructed the Huxes and the child soldiers to board a [[Imperialis (Jakku)|replica]] of the Emperor's yacht ''[[Imperialis]]'' while he and Tashu entered the Observatory to initiate Jakku's destruction. Ultimately, Rax was killed by Grand Admiral Sloane, who managed to stop Rax from destroying Jakku with the help of the rebel couple [[Norra Wexley]] and [[Brentin Lore Wexley]]. Seeking an opportunity to rebuild the Empire in her own image, Sloane accompanied the Huxes and the child soldiers on their journey into the Unknown Regions.<ref name="Empire's End" />

During the journey, Sloane befriend Armitage and struck an agreement to protect the boy from his father if he kept her safe from the children. Sloane subsequently beat Brendol into submission and forced him to stop hurting his son and to teach the boy everything he knew. For several months, the ''Imperialis'' traveled through the Unknown Regions in order. During the journey, Armitage and his father trained the children. He became more vicious during those months, which Sloane regarded as unusual even for such a small boy. After months of traveling through space, the ''Imperialis'' rendezvoused with the Emperor's [[Super Star Destroyer]], the ''[[Eclipse (Executor-class)|Eclipse]]''.<ref name="Empire's End" />

===The First Order===
{{Quote|Your son. Armitage. I know you don't like him. I suspect you hurt him&mdash;psychologically or physically, I don't know, and I don't care. You will leave him alone. And you will teach the boy everything that you know. Are we clear?|Rae Sloane, to Brendol Hux|Aftermath: Empire's End}}
[[File:Hux on the bridge.jpg|thumb|left|332x332px|Rising to the rank of general, Hux became a powerful man in the First Order.]]
Meanwhile, the New Republic signed the [[Galactic Concordance]] with the defeated Empire, ending the [[Galactic Civil War]] and dissolving the Empire.<ref name="Empire's End" /> Growing up in exile, Hux was raised by his father on stories of great Imperials and how the Empire saved the galaxy from the chaos of the [[Clone Wars]]. Due to his upbringing, Armitage believed that the New Republic was weak and would never live up to the supreme power of the Old Empire. Many other [[Imperial officer]]s also fled to the Unknown Regions along with the Huxes, where they would create the [[First Order]], a military and political junta that rose from the ashes of the fallen Empire and followed its imperial ideology. Using technological terror, Hux achieved military superiority throughout the Order, eventually gaining the rank of [[General]].<ref name="Visual Dictionary" />

As General, Hux had complete confidence in his troops, training methods and weapons. His soldiers, who were often trained on capital ships, underwent vivid simulations to create the most loyal soldiers for the Order. This system was an extension of the ideas of his father's [[Commandant's Cadets]], from the Arkanis [[Imperial Academy|Academy]].<ref name="Visual Dictionary" />

====Mission to Parnassos====
Around twenty [[Standard year|years]] after the [[Battle of Endor]], Hux ventured to [[Parnassos]] to respond to the [[distress signal]] sent by Brendol from the crash site of [[Palpatine's yacht|his ship]]. Hux arrived at the crash site personally, greeting his father, [[Phasma]], [[Siv]], and [[Frey]] impersonally and accepting Phasma and Frey into the First Order. Hux told his father that his disappearance had caused concern in the higher ranks of the First Order and that he needed to return immediately, as the [[Supreme Leader]] had many things to discuss with him.<ref name="Phasma">''[[Phasma (novel)|Phasma]]''</ref>

As he rode with Brendol, Phasma, and Frey to the [[Resurgent-class Star Destroyer|''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Absolution]]'', Hux bore witness to Brendol's [[orbital bombardment]] of Parnassos. Footage recovered from the shuttle that transported them to the ''Absolution'' was later recovered by [[Resistance]] intelligence agents. One of these agents, [[Vi Moradi]], viewed the recording and said that the look she saw Armitage giving Brendol was one of pure loathing.<ref name="Phasma" />

====Dealing with Brendol====
[[File:Hux and Phasma.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Hux committed patricide with the help of his ally Captain Phasma, who poisoned Brendol with the toxin of a Parnassos beetle.]]
Sometime after Phasma's recruitment and Brendol's return from his shipwreck on Parnassos, Phasma and Hux met and conspired to assassinate Brendol. Both agreed that the [[time]] had come for Brendol to [[Death|die]], and Hux left the actual killing up to Phasma with his only instruction being that she make it untraceable. Phasma went on to kill Brendol with the toxin from the bite of a [[Parnassos beetle]].<ref name="Phasma" />

Brendol dead, Hux gave a brief address to Captain [[Cardinal]] and the First Order [[Stormtrooper Corps (First Order)|stormtrooper corps]] to inform them of Brendol's death. Formalities aside, Hux ascended to his father's role in the [[First Order military]], and took his father's suite on the ''Absolution ''as his own.<ref name="Phasma" />

Years later, Cardinal met with Hux to discuss the circumstances of Brendol's death. Cardinal reported to Hux that Phasma had killed his father, information he had gotten from interrogating Resistance [[spy]] Vi Moradi, but Hux merely laughed in his face. Hux admitted to his role in Brendol's [[assassin]]ation, telling Cardinal that he had wanted his father dead. After affirming Cardinal's loyalty, Hux let him go, fully expecting Phasma to eventually finish the job of silencing him.<ref name="Phasma" />

===Cold war===
====GUHL-JO387O====

[[File:High Command - Adventures 3-.JPG|thumb|left|229x229px|Ren and Hux worked together during the First Order's hunt for Skywalker.]]
Later, Hux, Ren and two First Order [[admiral]]s gathered in a conference room aboard the ''Finalizer'' over the planet [[GUHL-JO387O]]. They were discussing travel to a planet in the [[Western Reaches]]. While in the conference, [[Unidentified creature (GUHL-JO387O)|the creature]] that [[Finn|FN-2187]] was chasing turned off the lights, interrupting the conference.<ref name="Pest Control">{{IDWAdventuresCite|3|[[Pest Control]]}}</ref>

====General of the First Order====
{{Quote|Supreme Leader, I take full responsibility for th&mdash;''"<br />"GENERAL! [&hellip;]'' Our strategy must now change.|Armitage Hux and Snoke|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}
[[File:Phasma Hux Ren.png|thumb|right|296x296px|General Hux and Kylo Ren, each of whom represented a different side of the First Order, were bitter rivals who competed for the Supreme Leader's approval.]]
[[34 ABY|Thirty years]] after the Battle of [[Endor]], Hux was the general who commanded [[Starkiller Base]], the primary base of operations of the First Order, as well as the ''Resurgent''-class [[Star Destroyer]] ''[[Finalizer]]'' and answered to Supreme Leader [[Snoke]]. Deeming [[Luke Skywalker]], the last Jedi, to be a threat to the First Order, Hux, along with [[Kylo Ren]], were given the directive. Though First Order possessed maps from the Empire that would lead them to the planet where Skywalker was hiding, they lacked a final piece. To that end, the ''Finalizer'' traveled to Jakku and dispatched a group of stormtroopers to [[Attack on Tuanul|attack]] the settlement of [[Tuanul]], where Ren captured a Resistance pilot named [[Poe Dameron]], who already acquired and hid the final piece of the map. After Ren interrogated Dameron, he informed Hux that the prisoner had entrusted the map to a [[BB-8]] unit. Hux dispatched stormtroopers back to Jakku to search for it and posted a bounty on the droid.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Subsequently, Dameron was freed by a stormtrooper and the pair attempted to escape on a [[TIE/sf space superiority fighter]], disabling the ''Finalizer's'' turbolasers. Hux ordered the ventral cannons to shoot down the fighter, causing it to crash-land on Jakku. Upon informing Ren of the incident, the dark knight deduced that the traitorous stormtrooper was [[Finn|FN-2187]]. Hux checked with Phasma, who noted that this was FN-2187's first offense.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Subsequently, Supreme Leader Snoke ordered BB-8 captured or destroyed if necessary. When Hux informed Ren, the latter questioned the competency of their stormtroopers, given that one of them committed high treason, and suggested that the First Order instead appropriate a clone army like the Galactic Republic and early Empire before them. Hux assured him that his stormtroopers were trained from birth to succeed and reminded Ren not to let his obsession with Skywalker interfere with their mission.

====Commanding Starkiller Base====
{{Quote|Today, is the end of the Republic. The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder. At this very moment in a system far from here, the New Republic, LIES TO THE GALAXY! While secretly supporting the treachery, of the loathsome Resistance. This fierce machine which you have built, upon which we stand will bring an end to the Senate, to their cherished fleet. ALL REMAINING SYSTEMS WILL BOW TO THE FIRST ORDER! AND WILL REMEMBER THIS... '''AS THE LAST DAY, OF THE REPUBLIC!!''' |Armitage Hux, announcing the fall of the New Republic|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}
[[File:Hux and Starkiller Base.png|thumb|left|312x312px|Using Starkiller Base's superweapon, Hux destroyed Hosnian Prime and killed billions of people in his quest to topple the New Republic.]]
After BB-8 [[Escape from Jakku|fled]] Jakku aboard the [[Millennium Falcon]], Hux and Ren returned to Starkiller Base, where they spoke to a hologram of Supreme Leader Snoke. Snoke was not happy that they let the droid slip through their fingers and stated that the Jedi would rise again if the map got to the Resistance. Hux humbly took full responsibility for his failure, but the Supreme Leader interrupted him, declaring that their strategy had to change. Hux suggested testing the [[superweapon]] and destroy the New Republic for supporting the Resistance, leaving their enemies vulnerable. After receiving authorization for the undertaking, Hux then assembled the First Order army at Starkiller Base and gave a grand speech, proclaiming that the destruction of the Republic would be the beginning of the First Order's rise to power in the galaxy. At his signal, the base's weapon fired and [[Hosnian Cataclysm|destroyed]] the [[Hosnian system]], which at the time hosted the Republic's capital and Senate, wiping away its leadership and fleet.<ref name="Episode VII" />

[[File:Hux Tells Snoke Starkiller Base is Finished.png|thumb|right|300px|With Starkiller's destruction imminent, Supreme Leader Snoke ordered Hux to evacuate the base and return to him with Ren.]]
Subsequently, the First Order received a tip from an informant on [[Takodana]] that BB-8 was there, so Ren led an [[Battle of Takodana|attack]] squadron. However, Ren instead captured BB-8's accomplice, the Jakku scavenger [[Rey]], because she had seen the map, and ordered the division to retreat as the Resistance engaged them. Ren brought Rey back to Starkiller Base and attempted to extract the map from her mind, only to learn that the girl was strong in the Force and turned his own mind probe against him. Hux later walked in a conversation between Ren and Snoke, the latter asking what happened to BB-8. The general humiliated his colleague by telling the Supreme Leader that Ren decided the droid was not longer valuable to the First Order's mission, and that the girl was all they needed. He then informed Snoke that they tracked the Resistance scout ship performing recon on Starkiller Base back to the [[Ileenium system]]. Snoke ordered Hux to use the superweapon to destroy the Resistance before they could find Skywalker.<ref name="Episode VII" />

However, while its weapon was charging up, the [[Battle of Starkiller Base|Resistance led a starfighter assault]] against Starkiller Base, which resulted in the base's oncoming collapse before it could fire on D'Qar. Hux was then ordered by Snoke to evacuate the planet and to take the defeated Kylo Ren with him,<ref name="Episode VII" /> something that Hux, having a very low opinion of Ren, was all too eager to accomplish knowing that Ren suffered a humiliating defeat.<ref name="TLJ Visual Dictionary">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref>

As he was making his way out of the base, Hux's path took him into proximity with the quarters of the Jerjerrod couple, which had been hit by falling debris from a crashed Tie fighter. There, he briefly witnessed the ongoing fight between First Order forces and members of the Resistance's J-Squadron. Officer Jul Jerjerrod requested aid from him, which Hux affirmed, assigning several of his accompanying stormtrooper detachment to aid in the capture of the squadron. <ref name="Attack on Starkiller Base">''[[Join the Resistance: Attack on Starkiller Base]]''</ref>

===First Order–Resistance war===
====Rendezvous with Captain Phasma====
{{Quote|I should have known that even an exploding planet could not kill you, nor impede your devotion to the First Order.|Armitage Hux, to Phasma|Captain Phasma, Part IV}}
A few days after the Assault on Starkiller Base, Hux greeted Phasma personally on his ship, the ''Finalizer''. He questioned Phasma's late return, to which she replied that she had been preoccupied with [[Hunt for Rivas|chasing down]] and dispatching the true culprit behind the one who had turned off the [[Planetary shield|shields]] at Starkiller Base. She named [[Lieutenant]] [[Sol Rivas]] as the perpetrator. Hux complimented her and promptly left, leaving Phasma to stare off at the sight of the First Order fleet gathering in large numbers.<ref name="Captain Phasma 4">''[[Captain Phasma, Part IV]]''</ref>

====Leading the Siege of D'Qar====
{{Quote|I have my orders from Supreme Leader Snoke himself. This is where we snuff out the Resistance once and for all.|Armitage Hux|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}
[[File:The Last Jedi Space Battle.png|thumb|left|300px|Although the Resistance evacuated D'Qar, Hux's hyperspace tracker ensured they could no longer escape the First Order through hyperspace.]]
After the Assault on Starkiller Base, Hux led a First Order fleet, including a [[Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought|Dreadnought]], to the [[Evacuation of D'Qar|evacuated]] main Resistance base on [[D'Qar]]. He was, however, briefly distracted by an insulting transmission from Poe Dameron, who repeatedly referred to Hux by the mocking term "General Hugs" and implied that Leia wanted to send a message about Hux's mother. Hux responded that he would not negotiate with the Resistance, but Poe responded as if he couldn't hear him. After a few more attempts which made Hux increasingly angry, he ultimately ordered the dreadnought to destroy the Resistance base, and afterwards, the main fleet. When Resistance bombers came to destroy the Dreadnought, Hux quickly dispatched all but one bomber, which promptly blew up the dreadnought and bought time for the Resistance to escape. However, Hux had a plan to track the Resistance ship through hyperspace, which he presented to Supreme Leader Snoke on his command ship, the ''[[Supremacy]]''.<ref name="Episode VIII">[[Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VIII ''The Last Jedi'']]</ref>

====Pursuit of the Resistance Fleet====
{{Quote|Keep up the barrage. Let's at least remind them that we're still here.|Armitage Hux|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}
[[File:Hux on the bridge.png|thumb|right|300px|Hux took command of Snoke's flagship, the ''Supremacy'' during the First Order's pursuit of the Resistance fleet.]]
During the [[Attack on the Resistance fleet|assault]] on the Resistance fleet, Hux ordered the Star Destroyers to keep at a distance and continue firing at the Resistance flagship ''[[Raddus (MC85 Star Cruiser)|Raddus]]''. After the Resistance's medical frigate ran out of fuel, Hux ordered it destroyed the second it was in range, though the ship was successfully evacuated prior to its destruction.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

When Finn and [[Rose Tico]] were captured while trying to disable the tracker on the ''Supremacy'', they were led to an assembly area of stormtroopers in the hangar, led by General Hux. Hux then struck Finn on the cheek, showing his disdain for him.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> After insulting the people of the [[Otomok system]], Tico's home system, she bit Hux on the hand.<ref name="Expanded Edition">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: Expanded Edition]]''</ref> Shortly after, Hux left the pair to be executed by Captain Phasma, having figured out the Resistance's plan to escape via thirty [[U-55 orbital loadlifter]]s, thanks to [[DJ]] divulging this information to the First Order. He also proceeded to have the fleet pick off any and all escape ships one by one. Focused on the annihilation of the transports, Hux brushed off the news that the ''Raddus'' was preparing a hyperspace jump as a failed ploy to distract them, unaware that Vice Admiral [[Amilyn Holdo]] was intending to jump the ''Raddus'' to lightspeed directly at the ''Supremacy''. Upon seeing she had turned about face, Hux frantically ordered all firepower concentrated on the ''Raddus'', but it was too late. The faster-than-lightspeed collision sliced the ''Supremacy'' in two, also annihilating at least six ''Resurgent''-class battlecruisers as well.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

After Holdo's suicide attack, General Hux went to the throne room, where during the battle Kylo Ren had killed Snoke. Discovering an unconscious Kylo Ren near the body of the Supreme Leader, Hux tried to take advantage of the situation to kill his rival but Ren woke up before he could act. After he expressed disbelief at seeing Snoke's dead body, Kylo told him that Rey killed Snoke and ordered him to move the men to [[Crait]], to crush the Resistance once and for all. Hux protested, stating than Ren had no rights to command him or his men but Kylo Force-choked Hux until he acknowledged him as the new Supreme Leader.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

====Battle of Crait====
{{Quote|That's enough. That's ''enough''! Do you think you got him?|Armitage Hux, to Kylo Ren|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}
[[File:Long Live The Supreme Leader.png|thumb|left|300px|After the assassination of Snoke, Ren resorted to strong-arm tactics in order to secure Hux's allegiance as the new Supreme Leader.]]
Hux was in [[Kylo Ren's command shuttle]] during the [[Battle of Crait]]. Once Kylo Ren gave the order to advance, Hux also attempted to issue the command, resulting in a sidelong stare by Kylo. After Kylo Ren fired on Luke Skywalker's force projection with [[All Terrain MegaCaliber Six]]es and [[First Order All Terrain Armored Transport]] [[walker]]s, Hux shouted at the pilots to stop firing, thinking that Skywalker had been completely destroyed by the barrage. Hux asked if Ren thought he got him, but was startled when the smoke cleared to reveal Skywalker completely unharmed. Ren ordered the command shuttle to land only for Hux to protest that Ren was getting distracted. In response, Kylo Ren hurled Hux against a wall with the Force, temporarily knocking him out. By the time Hux regained consciousness, the Resistance had already fled and reorganized itself into the Rebellion. He was present as Kylo Ren and the First Order Snowtroopers searched through the [[Crait outpost|now-abandoned base]].<ref name="Episode VIII" />

[[File:Armitage Hux TLJ.png|thumb|right|250px|General Armitage Hux was an ambitious officer who craved power and promoted technological innovation.]]
Armitage Hux was a [[Sexes|male]] [[human]] with red hair and pale skin. When he was a young child, his father Brendol Hux regarded him as a weak-willed boy.<ref name="LD" /> In his childhood, Hux was frequently belittled by his father. Despite Brendol's disdain for his own child, both Gallius Rax and Rae Sloane recognized that Armitage had the potential to become a military commander of the First Order. Under Rax's influence, the boy grew more vicious and was willing to order his father's child soldiers to hurt each other in order to assert his authority.<ref name="Empire's End" /> From childhood, Hux was raised on stories of heroic Imperials and how the Empire had brought peace and order to the galaxy following the Clone Wars. Hux believed that the the galaxy needed to be saved from chaos and that the New Republic was too weak to rein in these problems.<ref name="Visual Dictionary" /> Because he was born out of wedlock, he also held some incense against references to his mother, especially those done in a mocking light, which was best evident during the Evacuation of D'Qar, where Poe Dameron's insinuation that Leia wanted to give a message about Hux's mother was enough to have Hux angrily order for the ship to open fire on Dameron's squadron.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

As an adult, General Hux was a methodical commander who continued his father's program of training stormtroopers from infancy. Hux was a scientific and technologically-minded man who had little patience and understanding for Force-wielders like Kylo Ren. Hux had an acrimonious relationship with Kylo Ren and the two competed for the favor of the First Order's Supreme Leader Snoke.<ref name="Visual Dictionary" /> Hux was rankled by Kylo Ren's questioning of his faith in his men and methods. He also tried to deflect blame onto Kylo after First Order forces on Takodana failed to recover BB-8 and the map to Luke Skywalker.<ref name="Episode VII" />

[[File:Hux Starkiller Speech.png|thumb|left|300px|Remorseless and driven by the desire for power, Hux caused the deaths of billions by giving the order to fire the Starkiller at the Hosnian system.]]
He likewise hated Kylo Ren, to the extent that he secretly derived pleasure from whenever Kylo failed his mission or whenever Snoke reprimanded him, and also was glad that Kylo needed rescuing from the Starkiller Base after he was beaten by Rey, a lightsaber novice.<ref name="TLJ Visual Dictionary" /> His disdain for Kylo was such that after Snoke was prematurely killed, he initially considered assassinating Kylo on the spot while the latter was still unconscious prior to his stirring forcing him to abandon that plan, and shortly afterward made clear he had zero intention of acknowledging Kylo as the new Supreme Leader, and only ended up acknowledging it after Kylo telekinetically strangled him. Even afterward, however, he made subtle jabs at Kylo's expense, as after the walkers attacked what [[Force projection|appeared]] to be Luke Skywalker himself with a rain of blaster bolts on Kylo's orders, Hux proceeded to sarcastically ask if the blasts killed Skywalker before the cloud dispersed and revealed he was still present.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

Due to his upbringing, Hux believed that he was destined to rule the galaxy. He regarded the New Republic as an illegitimate government that had to be destroyed in order to usher in the First Order. Hux believed that Starkiller Base held the key to retaking the galaxy from the New Republic.<ref name="Visual Dictionary" /> Hux never saw the First Order as the restoration of the Empire, but rather a new and improved faction.<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> While Hux was distressed by the Resistance's destruction of Starkiller Base, he nevertheless complied with Snoke's orders to recover Kylo Ren and bring him to the Supreme Leader.<ref name="Episode VII" />

[[File:First Order Military.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Hux prided himself on the new generation of stormtroopers, all of whom were exceptionally trained and programmed from birth.]]
He also showed some degree of sadism, as evidenced during the late stages of the attack on the Resistance fleet, where he had the ''Supremacy'' pick off the various escaping U-55 orbital loadlifters.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> He also was highly ambitious, wanting to have direct control over the ''Supremacy'', although he was smart enough to know he should keep such desires buried lest he get negative attention from either Kylo Ren or Snoke.<ref name="TLJ Visual Dictionary" />

Kylo Ren had always wondered why Snoke would keep Hux around. When this was brought to his attention, an amused Snoke revealed that for all his supposed weaknesses, Hux would always be a reliable asset.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Snoke, who used Hux as a tool, was unaware that Hux had ambitions of usurping him to take the title of Supreme Leader for himself.<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> Unfortunately for Hux, Ren had the same idea and took the position of Supreme Leader after killing Snoke, leading Hux to serve him.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> However, as Hux was known to have ordered Phasma to kill his own father, Ren brought him wherever he went, like Crait, to supervise him and prevent any potential act of treason.<ref name="Expanded Edition" />

==Skills and abilities==
As a General in the First Order, Armitage Hux commanded the First Order's [[First Order army|armies]] and Starkiller Base.<ref name="Visual Dictionary" /> He was familiar with the operating systems of a ''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyer and Starkiller Base.<ref name="Episode VII" /> Although his technical rank was General, he commanded more authority in actuality than a standard general, though Snoke refused to promote him to the more appropriate rank of [[Grand Marshal]].<ref name="TLJ Visual Dictionary" />

==Equipment==
General Hux wore a charcoal grey general's uniform, black gloves, a polished officer's buckle, traditional flared-hip breeches, and insulated boots. He also wore a crested command cap emblazoned with the insignia of the First Order and a [[gaberwool]] officer's greatcoat. Hux believed that a tidy appearance was essential to maintaining discipline. When addressing his men, he wore a parade uniform designed to broadcast his authority as a First Order General.<ref name="Visual Dictionary" />

After the Battle of Starkiller Base, Hux would carry a cross draw holstered [[SE-44C blaster pistol]] and a [[Monomolecular blade|monomolecular dagger]] hidden in his sleeve.<ref name="TLJ Visual Dictionary" /> He would conceal the pistol by beginning to wear the greatcoat nearly always when in public.

While developing Hux's character, Gleeson and the film's production team posited that he was an obsessive character who does not get a lot of sleep.

[[File:FirstOrder.png|thumb|right|300px|Hux's speech to the First Order has been compared to Adolf Hitler addressing a Nuremberg Rally.]]
During filming of ''The Force Awakens'', several different versions were shot of a scene where Hux addresses the troops of the First Order, as J.J. Abrams hoped to try it at various levels of intensity. He ultimately "wanted it big," and he and screenplay writer [[Lawrence Kasdan]] believed that it was Hux's major moment in the movie.

===Continuity===
{{Quote|I'd imagined Zare catching sight of a red-haired baby in a hover-pram pushed by a sinister nanny droid, but that wound up feeling like a reference for a reference's sake, which I've come to believe undermines storytelling instead of supporting it.|Jason Fry, on writing ''Servants of the Empire: The Secret Academy''|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/the-force-awakens-secret-inside-the-secret-academy}}
Prior to ''The Force Awakens''{{'s}} release, a character named Brendol Hux was introduced in ''[[Servants of the Empire: The Secret Academy]]'', a young readers' book by [[Jason Fry]] that serves as a tie-in to the television program ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''. In the book, Brendol Hux reveals his ambition to create an army of soldiers loyal to the Galactic Empire from birth.<ref name="The Secret Academy">''[[Servants of the Empire: The Secret Academy]]''</ref> A StarWars.com [[Databank (website)|Databank]] entry later revealed that Brendol Hux is General Hux's father,<ref name="DB" /> and ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary]]'' went on to confirm that Hux's army of stormtroopers in the film&mdash;trained from infancy to be loyal to the First Order&mdash;are an extension of his father's group, the Commandant's Cadets.<ref name="Visual Dictionary" />

Fry originally conceived of the cadets to advance a plotline in his story, but he was struggling to find them a goal or a purpose that would eventually come into fruition. The idea to connect them with General Hux came in [[November]] 2014 when he met with [[Lucasfilm Ltd.]] about another project, ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: Incredible Cross-Sections]]'', and was privy to concept art, stills, and a synopsis of the upcoming movie. He then proposed to [[Pablo Hidalgo]] of the [[Lucasfilm Story Group]] that the idea of training children to be stormtroopers began with Hux's father in the era of ''Star Wars Rebels'', and when Hidalgo ran it up the chain of command, the answer came back in the positive. Fry considered inserting a "red-haired baby" Hux into his book, being cared for by a [[DDM-38|sinister nanny droid]], but he ultimately felt that it was a reference for the sake of a reference and cut it from the final draft.<ref name="sw.com Inside the Secret Academy">{{SW|url=news/the-force-awakens-secret-inside-the-secret-academy|text=''The Force Awakens'' Secret Inside ''The Secret Academy''}}</ref>
