'''Salacious B. Crumb''' was a [[Kowakian monkey-lizard]] who worked as a [[Jester (occupation)|jester]] in the court of the [[crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]] during the [[Galactic Civil War]]. Known for his shrill laughter, Crumb kept his master amused until his death during the [[Rescue of Han Solo|rescue of]] [[Han Solo]] by members of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]].

==Biography==
A [[Sexes|male]] [[Kowakian monkey-lizard]] from the [[planet]] [[Kowak]],<ref name="USW" /> Salacious B. Crumb was known for his shrill, cackling<ref name="Databank" /> laughter and sophisticated sense of humor like his fellow monkey-lizards. Many individuals of his [[species]] served as favored pets among denizens of the underworld, retaining their apparently hilarious-sounding names, and Crumb was no exception,<ref name="Kowakian Databank">{{Databank|kowakian-monkey-lizard|Kowakian Monkey-Lizard}}</ref> becoming the unofficial<ref name="Databank" /> court [[Jester (occupation)|jester]] of the [[Hutt]] [[crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]]. Crumb's association with Jabba began when the thief stowed away on the Hutt's [[starship]], and was found and captured by the [[Twi'lek]] [[Bib Fortuna]].<ref name="USW" /> Jabba struck up a unique deal with the monkey-lizard: If Crumb could amuse Jabba at least once a [[Standard day|day]], he would be allowed to eat and drink as much as he pleased; if he failed, however, he would be [[Death|slain]]. Crumb lived in this manner for over a dozen [[standard year]]s,<ref name="Card Trader" /> and henceforth sat beside Jabba to mercilessly tease and imitate captives, amusing his master greatly with his mimicry and laughter.<ref name="USW" /> Crumb even imitated visitors, courtiers, and even Jabba himself, and used his position on the Hutt's dais to steal morsels of food. Jabba's noxious pet was tolerated because of the amusement he brought Jabba, and because of his unwavering support for his master.<ref name="Databank" />

Crumb was present at Jabba's side when the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] arrived in [[Jabba's Palace]] to negotiate with the Hutt,<ref name="DV1">''[[Darth Vader 1: Vader]]''</ref> and later accompanied his master aboard the [[sail barge]] ''[[Khetanna]]'' to celebrate with Vader. Crumb laughed uproariously as Jabba's gangsters fired at a [[herd]] of [[bantha]]s, causing Vader to threaten the creature's life should he laugh again in his presence.<ref name="SW4">''[[Star Wars 4: Skywalker Strikes, Part IV]]''</ref>

Crumb was present when members of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] came to [[Rescue of Han Solo|rescue]] [[Han Solo]] from his boss' clutches. After Jabba took former [[Alderaan]] [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Organa]] as his [[Slavery|slave]] and [[Jedi Knight]] [[Luke Skywalker]] killed his pet [[rancor]] [[Pateesa]], he accompanied his boss and his guests on the ''Khetanna'' to the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]], where Jabba planned to execute the Rebels along Solo.<ref name="RotJ" /> When Skywalker managed to free himself and Leia cut off the lights of the barge, Jabba's guests, including Crumb, altered and ran in search of an exit from the barge while Organa seized the moment to choke Jabba to death with her chain. Following the Hutt's death, Crumb began to bite [[C-3PO]], almost snatching one of his eyes, but R2-D2 went to the rescue of the [[droid]] and shocked Crumb, who turned away annoyed. Crumb was eventually killed when the ''Khetanna'' was destroyed by the Rebels, who escaped alive.<ref name="Card Trader" />

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Salacious was a natural performer, and he was blessed with a panoply of physical features suitable for a crowd-pleasing clown: floppy ears, messy hair, wide-and-oh-so-hypnotic eyes, gangly limbs, clumsy movements, and an infectious cackle. But he didn't possess much of a brain between those outsize ears.|Lugubrious Mote|The Legends of Luke Skywalker}}
A Kowakian monkey-lizard with a distinctive shrill cackle, Salacious B. Crumb usually sat on Jabba Desilijic Tiure's dais, where he frequently stole food and mimicked, as the palace's unofficial jester, Jabba's courtiers, visitors and sometimes even Jabba himself. In fact, Salacious was just tolerated because his antics amused the Hutt and because of his unwavering support of his master.<ref name="Databank" />

Salacious was also known for his lack of respect, a trait which was demonstrated when the [[Sith Lord]] Darth Vader arrived to negotiate with the Hutt. Aboard Jabba's sail barge ''Khetanna'', he laughed uprariously as the Hutt's gangsters fired at a herd of banthas. The [[Sith]] [[Lord]] threatened the jester's life should he laugh again in his presence.<ref name="SW4" />

According to the [[mole-flea]] [[Lugubrious Mote]], Salacious was not very intelligent. She described him as "dumber than a newborn rancor.<ref name="Legends">''[[The Legends of Luke Skywalker]]'': "The tale of Lugubrious Mote</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
Salacious B. Crumb was voiced by [[Mark Dodson]] and puppeted by puppeter [[Tim Rose]], who also puppeted [[Admiral]] [[Gial Ackbar]], in the [[1983]] film [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]. As seen in the [[1985]] documentary ''[[From Star Wars to Jedi: The Making of a Saga]]'', Rose actually gave Crumb a voice (other than Crumb's laughing as seen in ''Return of the Jedi''), which he frequently used in conjunction with the puppet to joke around on set, but his voice was ultimately replaced with Dodson's. Salacious B. Crumb ended up being actor [[Anthony Daniels]]' favorite character of the series.<ref name="Making Jedi">''[[The Making of Return of the Jedi]]''</ref>

Salacious' name was pitched by ''The Empire Strikes Back'' and ''Return of the Jedi'' puppeteer [[Phil Tippett]]. On one occasion, when Tippett and his crew went out to lunch one day, he decided to bend down to tie his shoes, so he said "Wait a minute, guys, while I tie my soolacious", mispronouncing the word "Shoelaces". While ''[[Star Wars]]'' creator [[George Lucas]] initially rejected the name for Jabba's [[jester]], he finally changed his mind and accepted the idea, but he added the word "Crumb" for the character's surname as an homage to underground comic book artist [[Wikipedia: Robert Crumb|Robert Crumb]].<ref name="Making Jedi" />

According to [[Michael Carter]], the actor who played Jabba's [[majordomo]] Bib Fortuna, in a [[TheForce.net]] interview, during the filming of ''Jedi'', there were several scenes which involved [[Jess]] and Salacious B. Crumb, but these scenes, according to him, were cut from the final edit of the film.<ref name="TFNinterview">{{Cite_web
