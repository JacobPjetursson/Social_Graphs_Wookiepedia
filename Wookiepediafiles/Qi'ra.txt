{{Quote|I might be the only person who knows what you really are.|Qi'ra, to Han Solo|Solo: A Star Wars Story|audio=Qira-Only Person.ogg}}
'''Qi'ra''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|female]] from the [[planet]] [[Corellia]] who lived during the [[Imperial Era|reign]] of the [[Galactic Empire]]. She grew up on the streets along with [[Han Solo]] as part of the gang known as the [[White Worms]], and the two later became lovers. They tried to escape their life on Corellia but were separated.

After being sold into slavery by White Worms, Qi'ra was eventually bought by [[Dryden Vos]], the public leader of the [[Crimson Dawn]] crime syndicate, became a part of his opulent lifestyle and rose to be his top lieutenant. After reuniting with Solo, she accompanied him and friends on a mission to find a ship and retrieve [[coaxium]]. She found a ship that was owned by [[Lando Calrissian]] and rekindled her relationship with Solo. After the mission was unsuccessful, she returned to Vos, whom she then betrayed and killed. Qi'ra left Solo behind as she traveled to [[Dathomir]] to meet with [[Maul]], the true leader of Crimson Dawn.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Qi'ra [[Corellian|hailed]] from the [[planet]] [[Corellia]] during the [[Imperial Era|reign]] of the [[Galactic Empire]], before the [[Battle of Scarif|outbreak]] of the [[Galactic Civil War]].<ref name="Databank" /> She grew up on the streets and became friends with [[Han Solo|Han]].<ref name="Solo" /> By the [[time]] Qi'ra was eighteen [[Standard year|years]] old, she was enmeshed in a criminal life working for the [[White Worms]] gang on Corellia.<ref name="Databank" /> She was chosen by [[Lord|Lady]] [[Proxima]] to be the [[Head (White Worms)|Head]] Girl<ref name="Official Guide" /> after Han revealed to her that Qi'ra had turned down an opportunity to travel [[the galaxy]], but to work for her instead.<ref name="Most Wanted" /> Qi'ra attempted to flee Corellia with Han, by this point her lover, who had stolen a vial of [[coaxium]] during a delivery for Proxima that had gone badly. After a confrontation with Proxima, in which Solo caused a distraction by shattering a window allowing light in, exploiting her vulnerablility of her skin, he and Qi'ra attempted to escape through the Imperial control zone using the coaxium to bribe [[Falthina Sharest]], an [[Imperial Emigration Officer]]. Sharest agreed to allow them through, provided they handed over the coaxium before passing through the security gate. Solo reluctantly agreed, and instructed Qi'ra to hand it over. However, only Solo got through, Qi'ra was [[Prisoner|captured]] by several members of the White Worms, and the gate closed when Sharest triggered a security alert. Solo promised Qi'ra he would come back for her as soon as possible before he ran away from the gate.<ref name="Solo" />

===Road to Dryden Vos===
Qi'ra lived an even more difficult life after being captured again by [[Lady Proxima]]'s gang. The blistered Proxima was displeased of her actions, opting to sell Qi'ra away. She was sold to a slave dealer, [[Sarkin Enneb]], and later [[Dryden Vos]], the leader of [[Crimson Dawn]]. After a year of failed escapes, she attempted to do so yet again, killing the guard outside her cell and reaching the escape pods, only to find Vos waiting. He offered her a position within the ranks of Crimson Dawn, having seen potential within her, but he demanded her lifelong loyalty in return. Vos later branded Qi'ra's forearm and the back of her neck with the Crimson Dawn symbol.<ref name="Solo" />

===Life with Crimson Dawn===
With Crimson Dawn, Qi'ra lived a more opulent lifestyle, becoming Vos' top [[lieutenant]]. She was trained by Vos in the martial arts of [[Teräs Käsi]].<ref name="Solo" />

At some point during her employment with Crimson Dawn, Qi'ra found herself being pursued by [[bounty hunter]] droid [[IG-88]] on [[Ord Mantell]]. Qi'ra fell into a trap laid by IG-88 and its temporary partner, [[Weequay]] pirate [[Hondo Ohnaka]]. The two were planning on turning Qi'ra in for a bounty, but she was able to turn them against one another, giving her a chance to remove her bonds and capture them both, with intent to turn them in for their bounties.<ref name="Triplecross">{{FOD|Triplecross}}</ref>

Qi'ra's association with Crimson Dawn brought her back into contact with Solo, who was working with Vos' associate [[Tobias Beckett]] in order to obtain a large quantity of refined [[coaxium]]. Qi'ra attended the meeting between Vos, Beckett, and Solo on [[First Light|Vos' yacht]]. Vos berated Beckett and Solo for failing to obtain the coaxium shipment on [[Vandor]], and considered killing them until Solo suggested that they instead retrieve unrefined coaxium from the [[Spice mines of Kessel|spice mines]] of [[Kessel]]. Qi'ra advised Vos that the plan would work, and he agreed to allow Beckett to try, the penalty for failure being death. Vos sent Qi'ra to accompany Beckett's crew to make sure the plan would work.<ref name="Solo" />

===Finding Calrissian===
Knowing that they would need a particularly fast ship to transport the unrefined coaxium before it degraded and detonated, Qi'ra sought her old acquaintance, [[Captain]] [[Lando Calrissian]] of the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. Qi'ra watched as Solo failed to win the ''Falcon'' at [[sabacc]]. However, Calrissian agreed to fly the ''Falcon'' for Qi'ra, Beckett, and Solo in exchange for a cut of the profits. En route to Kessel, Qi'ra and Solo rekindled their romance, kissing in the back of the ''Falcon''.<ref name="Solo" />

===Kessel heist===
[[File:Chewie and Qira.png|thumb|197px|left|Chewie and Qi'ra approaching [[Quay Tolsite]]]]
Upon arriving at Kessel, Qi'ra masqueraded as a [[slaver]], Oksana Floren, selling Han and [[Chewbacca]] to [[Quay Tolsite]] of [[Pyke Syndicate]] in order to infiltrate the mines. Qi'ra, Beckett, and [[L3-37]] secured the control room, allowing Solo to steal the coaxium. Qi'ra initially served as Solo's co-pilot during the escape from Kessel, but was replaced by Chewbacca.<ref name="Solo" />

===Savareen===
{{Quote|Qi'ra... you and I will be working much more ''closely'' from now on.|Maul addresses Qi'ra after summoning her to Dathomir|Solo: A Star Wars Story}}
On Savareen, the ''Falcon'' crew refined the coaxium and awaited Vos' arrival. They were confronted by [[Enfys Nest]], leader of the [[Cloud-Riders]], who told them they were freedom fighters resisting the atrocities of Crimson Dawn, not pirates. Solo devised a plan to give Vos fake coaxium, and give the Cloud-Riders the real coaxium in order to fund their resistance. Qi'ra, Solo, and Chewbacca presented the coaxium to Vos aboard his yacht, but he saw through their plan, made aware in advance by Beckett, who had been Vos' double agent all along. Vos expressed his disappointment that Qi'ra betrayed him, and realized that Solo was her weakness.<ref name="Solo" />

However, Solo foresaw Beckett's treachery, and double-crossed him: the coaxium containers left with the Cloud-Riders were empty, and Enfys Nest dispatched the Crimson Dawn agents sent to recover it. The coaxium they brought along was in fact genuine. Beckett captured Chewbacca, and left with the coaxium. Vos and Solo fought, but Qi'ra intervened, holding Solo at sword point. However, Qi'ra sided with Solo, dueling and killing Vos.<ref name="Solo" />
[[File:Solo-MaulHolo.jpeg|thumb|278px|Maul contacted by Qi'ra]]
Solo left to rescue Chewbacca and retrieve the coaxium for the Cloud-Riders. Qi'ra told Solo she would be right behind him, but instead took Vos' [[Crimson Dawn signet ring|ring]], and used it to contact [[Maul]], the actual leader of Crimson Dawn, informing him that Vos had failed to obtain the coaxium. Qi'ra was then ordered to bring the yacht to [[Dathomir]], Maul’s homeworld, and that she would be working more closely with Maul, leaving Solo behind.<ref name="Solo" />

===Legacy===
Years later, Han told the story of how he and Qi'ra managed to break out from the [[Den of the White Worms]] to [[Princess]] [[Leia Organa]].<ref name="Jon's Twitter">{{Twitter|JonKasdan|status/1040529501870944256|[[Jon Kasdan]]|quote=In honor of the digital release of #SoloAStarWarsStory & in lieu of a commentary, here are 53 random factoids & notes about the making & writing for anybody who's interested.

==Personality and traits==
Qi'ra was a Corellian [[human]] [[Sexes|female]] with moderately short [[Color|brown]] [[hair]] that was usually kept in a ponytail, blue [[eyes]], and light skin.<ref name="Databank" /> Qi'ra was a very complex woman. When she was younger she was hopeful that she could escape the criminal life and strove for something better. But as she grew older she realized that because of all the bad things she had done, there was no escaping the criminal life. Despite having grown up on the streets, she was able to adapt to a lusher lifestyle and fit in with the Crimson Dawn gang. Having known Han for so many years, she believed she may have been the one person who could see him for who he truly was, thinking he was “the good guy”.<ref name="Solo" /> She was a fighter and had been trained in combat by Vos, which helped her survive.

In the earliest version of the script from late [[2013]], her name was Kura, as originally conceived by Kasdan,<ref name="Jon's Twitter" /> while in early concept art, she was an [[alien]].
