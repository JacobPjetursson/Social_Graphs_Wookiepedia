{{Quote|They destroyed our home. I will kill them.|Baze Malbus|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story}}
'''Baze Malbus''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] [[Reproduction|born]] on the [[desert]] [[moon]] of [[Jedha]] [[53 BBY|fifty-three years]] before the [[Battle of Yavin]]. Once a devoted member of the [[Guardians of the Whills]], Malbus became a freelance [[assassin]] during the [[Imperial Era|age]] of the [[Galactic Empire]]. Nevertheless, he maintained a friendship with [[Chirrut Îmwe]], who also served with the Guardians. Following the [[Destruction of Jedha City|destruction]] of [[Jedha City]], Malbus and Îmwe became part of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel]] group known as [[Rogue One (squad)|Rogue One]]. After Îmwe's [[death]] in an explosion during the [[Battle of Scarif]], Malbus rushed the Imperial [[death trooper]]s and was killed by a [[C-25 fragmentation grenade]].

==Biography==
===Early Life===
Born in [[53 BBY]] on the [[desert]] [[moon]] of [[Jedha]], Baze Malbus joined the [[Guardians of the Whills]] alongside his best friend [[Chirrut Îmwe]]. As members of the religious order, they were tasked with guarding the [[Temple of the Kyber]] in [[Jedha City]].<ref name="Rogue One" />

===Age of the Empire===
[[File:Baze Malbus U-Wing XWM.png|left|thumb|200px|Baze Malbus on Jedha]]
In the aftermath of the [[Proclamation of the New Order]], the holy [[city]] of NiJedha was occupied by the [[Imperial Military|armed forces]] of the [[Galactic Empire]].<ref name="Rogue One" /> The harsh conditions of Imperial occupation transformed Malbus into a cynical [[soldier]], although he also remained lifelong friends with the spiritual Îmwe.<ref name="Malbus DB" />

====Joining the Rebellion====
{{Quote|You ''almost'' shot me.''"<br />"''You're welcome.|Chirrut Îmwe and Baze Malbus|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story}}
By [[0 BBY]], approximately two [[Standard decade|decades]] into the [[Imperial Era|Age of the Empire]], Malbus and Îmwe encountered [[Jyn Erso]] and [[Captain]] [[Cassian Jeron Andor|Cassian Andor]] of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] in NiJedha. During the ensuing [[Partisans|insurgent]] [[Battle on Jedha|attack]] on Imperial [[troop]]s, Îmwe came to Erso and Andor's aid and defeated a group of [[stormtrooper]]s, leading Malbus to shoot several more [[trooper]]s in order to protect his blind comrade. The two friends and their Rebel acquaintances were subsequently captured and taken to the [[Catacombs of Cadera]] by [[Saw Gerrera]]'s followers, but ultimately managed to escape when the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]] [[Destruction of Jedha City|obliterated]] NiJedha.<ref name="Rogue One" />

Malbus and Îmwe followed the Rebels on their [[Mission to Eadu|mission]] to [[Eadu]]&mdash;the location of [[Galen Walton Erso|Galen Erso]], Jyn's [[Parent|father]] and the chief [[scientist]] responsible for the creation of the Empire's new [[battle station]]. The assignment led to a firefight between Imperial and [[Alliance Military|Alliance forces]], resulting in the [[death]] of the elder Erso. After the battle, Malbus accompanied his allies to the [[Great Temple (Yavin 4)|Alliance headquarters]] on [[Yavin 4]].<ref name="Rogue One" />

====Battle of Scarif====
{{Quote|The Force is with me and I am one with the Force. |Baze Malbus' last words|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story}}
[[File:Baze Malbus shoots an AT-ACT.png|thumb|left|250px|During the Battle of Scarif, Malbus fired on an [[All Terrain Armored Cargo Transport]] (AT-ACT), failing to damage. The transport was then destroyed by a x-wing fighter.]]
Shortly after their arrival, Jyn Erso made an unsuccessful attempt to persuade the [[Alliance Cabinet|Alliance leaders]] in sending a [[Navy|fleet]] to [[Scarif]], believing her late father's revelation that a fatal flaw in the Death Star's design could be found in its [[Death Star plans|schematics]]. In spite of the Alliance leadership's unwillingness to act, Erso was joined by Malbus, Îmwe, and a group of soldiers in an [[Battle of Scarif|unsanctioned mission]] to Scarif. The newly formed [[Rogue One (squad)|Rogue One]] successfully infiltrated the Imperial stronghold, but were forced to fight a battle against the [[planet]]'s garrison while Erso and Andor searched for the plans in the [[Imperial security complex]]. During the battle, Îmwe sacrificed his life to help deactivate the planetary [[deflector shield]], causing Malbus to begin repeating his good friend's mantra before proceeding to kill several [[death trooper]]s, maintaining the offensive until he himself was killed by a [[grenade]]. Though the remaining members of Rogue One also perished, their sole mission ended in the successful transmission of the Death Star plans to the [[Alliance Fleet]].<ref name="Rogue One" />

==Personality and traits==
Baze Malbus was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] who stood at 1.80 [[meter]]s.<ref name="Visual Guide" /> He had [[Color|brown]] [[eye]]s, black [[hair]], and tan skin.<ref name="Rogue One" /> Unlike the deeply spiritual Chirrut Îmwe, whom he regarded as his best friend and moral compass, Malbus had lost his sense of spirituality, including his belief in [[the Force]], as a result of enduring the harsh conditions of Imperial occupation on Jedha. In contrast to Îmwe, Malbus developed a pragmatic viewpoint<ref name="Malbus DB" /> but ultimately reaffirmed his faith in the Force after his friend's death on Scarif.<ref name="Rogue One" />

Malbus was highly adept at long-range combat. His preferred weapon was the [[heavy repeater cannon]], which he could utilize with expert marksmanship.<ref name="Malbus DB" />

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Chirrut and Baze concept art by Glyn Dillon.png|thumb|right|180px|Concept art of Baze Malbus (right) alongside Chirrut Îmwe]]
Baze Malbus is portrayed by [[Jiang Wen]] in the ''[[Star Wars Anthology Series]]'' film ''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''. Wen's casting in the film was first announced on [[August 15]], [[2015]]. At this time, the first photo of the character was released as well.<ref name="Rogue One Cast">{{SW|url=news/rogue-one-the-daring-mission-has-begun-cast-and-crew-announced|text=''Rogue One''&mdash;The Daring Mission Has Begun: Cast and Crew Announced}}</ref> The first footage of the character was shown in the ''Rogue One'' teaser trailer on [[April 7]], [[2016]].<ref name="Teaser">{{SW|url=video/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-official-teaser-trailer|text=Rogue One: A Star Wars Story Official Teaser Trailer}}</ref>

Baze and Chirrut replaced another pair featured in early treatments of the story&mdash;that of the [[alien]]s Senna and [[Lunak]]. Lunak was cut entirely from the final version of the movie, while Senna eventually became the [[mercenary]] [[Moroff]].<ref name="rogueart">''[[The Art of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''</ref>
