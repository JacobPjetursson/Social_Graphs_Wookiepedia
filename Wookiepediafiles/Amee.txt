{{Quote|You've been working on that thing for years... |Amee to nine-year-old Anakin Skywalker regarding his podracer|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace}}
'''Amee''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|girl]] who lived on [[Tatooine]] and an associate of [[Anakin Skywalker]]. Observing Skywalker's completed [[podracer]], she noted that he had been working on it for [[Standard year|years]]. [[Melee]] followed this up by stating that it would never fly.<ref name="tpm" />

==Behind the scenes==
Amee was played by [[Katie Lucas]] in [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']], credited as "Jenna Green". The character's name was given in the film's closing credits.<ref name="tpm" />

In ''The Phantom Menace'', Amee can be clearly seen wearing braces, as Katie Lucas was wearing them at the time of the filming.
