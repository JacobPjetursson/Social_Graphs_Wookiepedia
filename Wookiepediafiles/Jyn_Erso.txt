{{Quote|Rebellions are built on hope.|Jyn Erso|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story}}
'''Jyn Erso''' was a [[human]] [[sexes|female]] [[soldier]] and former criminal who became a pivotal member of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] when she led [[Rogue One (squad)|Rogue One]] in stealing the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]] [[Death Star plans|plans]] during the [[Battle of Scarif]]. She was the daughter of [[Lyra Erso]], a devout member of the [[Church of the Force]], and [[Scientist/Legends|scientist]] [[Galen Walton Erso|Galen Erso]], who was forced into helping the [[Galactic Empire]] build the Death Star. Erso's mother was [[Death|killed]] when [[Director]] [[Orson Callan Krennic|Orson Krennic]], the commander of the Death Star project, kidnapped her father&mdash;who affectionately referred to his daughter as "'''Stardust'''." She was raised by resistance fighter [[Saw Gerrera]] and became a child soldier in his [[Partisans|army]].

After being abandoned by the Partisans, Erso spent several years on her own, committing a number of crimes in order to survive in a dangerous [[The galaxy|galaxy]]. In [[0 BBY]], she was recruited by the Rebel Alliance to find Gerrera on [[Jedha]], where he had information about Galen and the Death Star project. She found a [[Hologram|holographic]] recording of her father who confirmed the existence of the Death Star and that the plans kept on [[Scarif]] would reveal a fatal weakness he planted in its design. She attempted to save her father on [[Eadu]], but he was killed. With little support from the Rebel Alliance, Jyn and [[Captain]] [[Cassian Jeron Andor|Cassian Andor]] led a [[squad]], Rogue One, to Scarif where they stole the plans from the [[Imperial security complex]]. She transmitted the plans to the [[Alliance Fleet]] that arrived in [[orbit]], but the Death Star soon fired on Scarif in an attempt to eliminate the Rebel threat. Erso and Andor were the last surviving members of their squad, and they died when the blast reached the complex.

Erso was remembered fondly by the Rebel [[Chancellor (Rebel Alliance)|leader]], [[Mon Mothma]], who believed that she would have become an even more extraordinary person if she had survived. Her sacrifice was not in vain, however. The Rebel Alliance used the plans to discover the flaw Galen built into the [[battle station]], and the weapon was destroyed by [[Luke Skywalker]] during the [[Battle of Yavin]], starting a chain reaction which would see the doom of the Empire.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Jyn Erso was [[Reproduction|born]] on the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] [[Water|ice]] [[planet]] of [[Vallt]] in [[21 BBY]] during the [[Clone Wars]] to [[Galen Walton Erso|Galen Erso]], a pacifist [[scientist]] working for [[Zerpen Industries]], and [[Lyra Erso]], Galen's [[Marriage|wife]] and colleague in the [[company]]. Born within a [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist]] [[Tambolor prison|prison]] due to her [[Parent|father's]] refusal to use his intelligence and knowledge of [[kyber crystal]]s to help the Confederacy in their war against the [[Galactic Republic]], Jyn spent approximately six [[Standard month|months]] in the care of her mother and the caretakers of the complex. At that point, Jyn and her parents were unexpectedly ordered onto a carriage and sent to a [[spaceport]] where, to the surprise of her parents, [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Orson Callan Krennic|Orson Krennic]] of the [[Republic Navy]], who Galen knew from their [[time]] in the [[Republic Futures Program|Republic's Futures Program]], was waiting to [[Rescue of Galen Erso|extract]] them and bring them to [[Coruscant]].<ref name="Catalyst" />

For the next several months, Jyn lived in an apartment in Coruscant's [[Galactic City]] while her father looked for work. As the Clone Wars approached its end, Jyn's father was notified by Krennic that he had been offered a position in [[Helical HyperCom]] on the planet [[Lokori]]. Accepting the offer, the [[Erso family|Ersos]] moved to the world and settled there while Galen worked on the company's renewable energy project.<ref name="Catalyst" />

In [[19 BBY]], after several attacks by the Separatists on the planet, the Confederacy launched a large [[Battle on Lokori|assault]] on the [[Helical HyperCom's headquarters|Helical HyperCom facility]] and the surrounding area. With a large force of [[B1 battle droid]]s advancing on the complex, Jyn's parents fled the facility with her in a carrier into the surrounding settlement. With battles raging on multiple sides, the Ersos were rerouted by a group of [[clone trooper]]s but were eventually surrounded. Climbing up a mound of rubble in front of a building, Lyra and Galen attempted to get atop the structure but found it was too tall. With the [[battle droid]]s approaching and [[Death|killing]] the remaining [[Lokori (species)|Lokori]] in the vicinity, Galen placed himself in front of Jyn and Lyra. To their surprise and relief however, the [[droid]]s suddenly shut down. Unknown to them, the Clone Wars had just ended.<ref name="Catalyst" />

===Age of the Empire===
====Living on Coruscant====
With the war over, the Republic was [[Proclamation of the New Order|reorganized]] into the [[Galactic Empire]] by former [[Supreme Chancellor]], now [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]], [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]]. Krennic, having convinced Galen to work for the Empire in a supposed kyber [[crystal]] sustainable energy project which was in fact a [[superweapon]] development [[Project Stardust|program]] called [[Project Celestial Power]], relocated the Erso family to the project's [[Project Celestial Power complex|complex]], built upon the former [[B'ankor Refuge]]. As Galen's work went on he became more distant from Jyn, who spent a lot of her time in the care of an [[MV droid|MV]] [[nanny droid]] nicknamed "[[Mac-Vee]]." During this time, Jyn would watch bedtime [[holodrama]]s, such as ''[[The Octave Stairway]]''.<ref name="Catalyst" />

[[File:J Erso on Coruscant.jpg|thumb|left|230px|A four-year-old Jyn on Coruscant]]
When she was three [[Standard year|years]] old, Jyn, along with her mother, [[Has Obitt]] and [[Nari Sable]], traveled to the Outer Rim planet of [[Alpinn]] on Krennic's request to help with the [[Archaeology|archeological]] project being conducted there. While there, Jyn would go exploring with the three of them and would revel in being at the center of attention back at the [[Alpinn archaeology camp|archeological camp]]. After returning to Coruscant, Jyn's father was more distant than ever, especially in regards to Lyra. Unbeknownst to Jyn, their indifference was a product of their conflicting views of Project Celestial Power, with each of her parents keeping secrets from the other.<ref name="Catalyst" />

Sometime later, Galen approached Jyn and asked her about a picture she was drawing, to which she told him it was a character from ''The Octave Stairway'' named [[Brin]]. Galen noticed the figure looked similar to him, and Jyn told him he could be Brin if he wanted. A sudden flush of regret and love washed over Galen as he expressed his regrets in not being around her more. Later, Galen and Lyra shared their doubts about Krennic and realized Galen's kyber research was in fact being used for nefarious ends. Knowing they could not merely resign, the pair decided to attempt an escape. Arranging an extraction point and time with Has Obitt, Galen and Lyra, with a four year-old Jyn in her arms, left the complex and struggled through the parading crowds. However, with Obitt having been caught by Krennic, the [[smuggler]]'s colleague, former [[Onderonian]] [[Onderon rebels|freedom fighter]] [[Saw Gerrera]], met with the Ersos and led them to his [[Saw's shuttle|own]] [[starship]]. Leaving Coruscant, Jyn and Gerrera surveyed the [[star]]s from the front window of the ship. Confirming a suitable planet, Jyn and Gerrera told Galen and Lyra about a world they could go into hiding on: [[Lah'mu]]. Before departing into [[hyperspace]], Gerrera handed Jyn's parents a [[Saw Gerrera's Com card|com card]] that they could use to contact him if they ever felt the need. Though she was sad that she had to leave her toys and Mac-Vee behind, Jyn found comfort in the company of her parents and the fact she had found a new friend in Saw Gerrera.<ref name="Catalyst" />

====Into hiding====
{{Quote|Jyn, whatever I do, I do it to protect you. Say you understand.''"<br />"''I understand.|Galen and Jyn|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story|audio=Galen & Jyn.ogg}}
[[File:Jyn given a kyber.png|thumb|right|325px|Jyn being given a kyber crystal by her mother]]
For the next four years, Jyn lived with her parents in a [[Erso homestead|homestead]] on the remote world of Lah'mu in order to avoid the Empire.<ref name="Visual Guide" /> In the event of compromise, the Ersos established a plan which involved a hatched room hidden underneath a rock that Jyn would escape to. This plan was put into effect<ref name="Rogue One" /> in [[13 BBY]],<ref name="Visual Guide" /> when Orson Krennic, accompanied by a contingent of [[death trooper]]s, [[Capture of Galen Erso|arrived]] at their home. After contacting Saw Gerrera, Galen said a solemn goodbye to Jyn before heading out to face Krennic, while Lyra led Jyn around the back. Handing Jyn [[Jyn's kyber pendant|a kyber crystal pendant necklace]], Lyra told Jyn to go to the hideout before leaving to also confront Krennic. However, Jyn decided to follow and hide in the long [[grass]], watching as Lyra pulled a [[blaster pistol]] on Krennic. As he ordered his [[trooper]]s to fire, Lyra managed to fire off one shot into Krennic's shoulder before being killed. Realizing it was time to get away, Jyn ran to the hideout as Krennic took Galen and ordered his death troopers to search for her.<ref name="Rogue One" />

After spending some time in the underground room, Jyn heard footsteps approaching above. When the hatch opened, she saw Gerrera standing there, who urged her to come out.<ref name="Rogue One" /> Gerrera raised the young girl as his own daughter.<ref name="Rogue One Novel">[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (novelization)|''Rogue One: A Star Wars Story'' novelization]]</ref> For the next eight years, Jyn found a connection with the hardened warriors, becoming a [[soldier]] working for Gerrera's [[Partisans|insurgents]], whose actions were considered by many to be immoral,<ref name="Visual Guide" /> although Gerrera attempted to shield Jyn from some of the worst atrocities he and the others committed.<ref name="Rogue One Novel" /> At the age of [[10 BBY|eleven]], Erso accompanied Gerrera on a meeting with [[Enfys Nest]] and the [[Cloud-Riders]], who offered him [[coaxium]] to aid in the fight against the Galactic Empire. Gerrera introduced Erso as his ward and Nest wondered why he would bring her to such a dangerous meeting. Gerrera replied that she needed to learn, and Nest advised Erso that people would underestimate her due to her age and suggested that she make them regret it. Later, as Nest boarded a [[shuttle]] to conduct further discussion with Gerrera, Erso whispered that Gerrera would underestimate her. Nest smiled, considering the girl a fast learner.<ref name="Solo Expanded">''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: Expanded Edition]]''</ref> At the age of twelve, Jyn met [[Arhul Nemo]] of the [[Commenor Underground]], who considered her his favorite of Gerrera's militia.<ref name="Rebel Dossier">''[[Star Wars: Rogue One: Rebel Dossier]]''</ref>

====Abandoned on Tamsye Prime====
{{Quote|He knows who you really are. A secret like that, once exposed, cannot be hidden again.''"<br />"''You're coming back for me, right? Promise?''"<br />"''Go! Run!|Saw Gerrera and Jyn Erso|Rebel Rising}}
[[File:Jyn and Saw mission to Tamsye Prime.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Jyn being abandoned by Saw on Tamsye Prime]]
When Jyn was sixteen, she joined Gerrera and a group of Partisans on a [[Mission to Tamsye Prime|mission]] to [[Tamsye Prime]] to [[scout]] out a old Clone Wars munitions [[factory]] that the Empire was using in hopes of a future, larger attack. Establishing a cover as tertiary units on a [[propaganda]] documentary filming on the site, Jyn forged the [[scandoc]]s for their cover, giving herself the alias "Kestrel Dawn."<ref name="Rebel Rising">''[[Rebel Rising]]''</ref>

They arrived on site, only to be betrayed by one of their own, [[Reece Tallent]], who also suspected Jyn's true identity. The remaining Partisans fought their way out out the trap and the Empire's planned destruction of the factory, but with the Empire behind them, Gerrera gave Jyn a small [[blaster]] and ordered her to hide in an old shell [[turret]] until daylight. Believing that he would come back for her, Jyn watched from the bunker as Gerrera dealt with the traitorous Tallent, then left for the [[Unidentified spaceport (Tamsye Prime)|spaceport]], leaving her alone.<ref name="Rebel Rising" /> Being discarded like that would leave Jyn with little capacity to trust others<ref name="Rogue One" /> and nursing bitter feelings and hatred for the two fathers who had abandoned her.<ref name="Rogue One Novel" />

====Escaping Tamsye Prime====
Realizing that Gerrera was not coming back for her and that the Imperials would lay waste to Tamsye Prime to eliminate the witnesses, Jyn left the bunker to find that Tallent's ship was still docked, with her satchel of spare [[Clothing|clothes]], truncheons, and code replicator. Enlisting the help of a [[Unidentified pilot (Tamsye Prime)|young man]] trying to find an escape ship, Jyn and her new passenger escaped the world. Realizing that the Imperials would work out that their ship had used [[Forger (profession)|forged]] codes to leave, the man directed them to junkers he had contact with to sell the ship so it could be taken apart and the trail erased. Splitting the money fifty fifty, Jyn and her [[pilot]] parted ways.<ref name="Rebel Rising" />

Not knowing the name of the world she was on, Jyn wandered to the spaceport looking for passage off-world. Introducing herself as "Jyn Dawn," she arranged passage on a [[freighter]] ship operated by one [[Akshaya Ponta]] in exchange for repairing a broken droid (Jyn lied about knowing how to fix it). En route, Jyn used her forging skills to help Ponta evade an Imperial ship. Grateful, Ponta offered to let Jyn stay with her and her family on [[Skuhl]] for a while and get back on her feet.<ref name="Rebel Rising" />

====A new home====
{{Quote|It wasn't that long ago when my son cooked for me, but now there's a pretty girl to distract him.''"<br />"''Yup.|Akshaya and Hadder Ponta on the new family dynamics Jyn introduced|Rebel Rising}}
Settling in with Ponta, who had a son about Jyn's age, [[Hadder Ponta|Hadder]], Jyn offered to help forge useful documents for Ponta's shipping business, but found herself with a lot of free time on her hands, something she wasn't used to. Jyn and Hadder established a rapport over time. With Hadder's interest in flying and space travel being forbidden, the duo began clandestine flights on the Ponta's [[planet hopper]] when Hadder's mother was away on business.<ref name="Rebel Rising" />

====First love====
{{Quote|If you were so interested, why didn't you say anything sooner?''"<br />"''Because if you didn't want me, you would break my heart and potentially my body.''"<br />"''Who's to say I won't do that anyway?''"<br />"''You can do whatever you want to my body.|Jyn Erso and Hadder Ponta|Rebel Rising}}
As the months went by, Jyn adapted to her new life, moving on from everything about her old one as a freedom fighter (save for her forging skills). She and Hadder, who had taken something of an interest in her from the beginning, began to grow closer.<ref name="Rebel Rising" />

During one of their secret flights, Hadder took Jyn to a field for a picnic. While eating, he explained that he was thinking about joining a resistance group, since it would give him the chance to fly, and wanted to know if Jyn would come with him. Not wanting to get involved with another Rebel group and happy with life as it was, Jyn told him that she wouldn't. Hadder decided that, even if it meant giving up a chance to fly, he would rather stay with her. This confession lead to the two admitting that they had feelings for each other and started their relationship.<ref name="Rebel Rising" />

====Imperial crackdown====
However, when the couple came back to the Ponta's home, they found Akshaya Ponta waiting for them; the Empire was beginning to crack down on Skuhl. While the elder Ponta didn't want to leave the home that she had made for her family (biological and surrogate), Jyn and Hadder realized that there was no way to get around it. As the Empire began to tighten its grip, the young lovers eventually convinced Akshaya were eventually forced to make preparations to leave for the [[Five Points system]] to make a new start.<ref name="Rebel Rising" />

Unfortunately, the night before they planned to leave, [[stormtrooper]]s arrived at the home, suspecting that Jyn was the same "Jyn" involved with the rebels at the Tamsye Prime factory incident. All three managed to escape, although they were separated. Jyn took the planet hopper while Hadder and his mother took the freighter. With the space around Skuhl a [[Escape from Skuhl|battle zone]] between the Empire and rebel fighters, the freighter was destroyed, killing Hadder and Akshaya, leaving Jyn to arrive at the [[Five Points]] [[Space station|station]] by herself. The deaths of two more people she cared for (especially since Hadder hadn't left with a rebel group before the fighting started because of her), left guilt that Jyn carried with her.<ref name="Rebel Rising" />

====Life as a criminal====
{{Quote|She has no loyalty to any person or cause except herself. She should have been left in jail.|Davits Draven's assessment of Jyn's character, based on her criminal record|Star Wars: Rogue One: Rebel Dossier}}
Orphaned for a third time, Jyn spend the next five years focusing on survival, becoming a street figure, smuggler, and petty criminal. She wandered through [[the galaxy]], using and discarding aliases such as Liana Hallik, Tanith Ponta,<ref name="Visual Guide" /> Lyra Rallik, and Nari McVee to hide her true identity.<ref name="Rebel Dossier" /> When arrested, Jyn was able to escape from prison, either through help from friends outside or by bribing (or lying about a bribing) security guards.<ref name="Rogue One Novel" />

As the years blurred together, she worked on a [[Tibanna]] [[Tibanna gas tanker|gas tanker]] in the [[Anoat]] [[Anoat system|system]], wandered between the [[Mid Rim]] worlds [[Cerea]] and [[Coyerti]], spent a year on [[Takodana]], and worked for an extensive period of time forging codes for a freighter, before transferring to a planet-based job.<ref name="Rebel Rising" /> Once she had planned a scheme against a "petty [[Politics#Dictatorship|dictator]]" that involved blowing up his ship and stealing the guns in his possession. The crime failed and she was arrested. The dictator had her dragged through the streets and locked in holding, with the stormtroopers using the most brutal treatment allowed, such as pointing [[rifle]]s at her and using [[stun prod]]s.<ref name="Rogue One Novel" />

[[File:The Strangers Jyn.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jyn returns Tookie to her owner.]]
While visiting [[Garel City]], Jyn would exhibit her heroic nature that would become more clear later in her life. Erso was buying [[fruit]] from an [[Ortolan]] [[merchant]] when she heard two stromtroopers forcibly seizing a pet [[Tookie|Tooka-cat]] from a [[Tookie's owner|young girl]]. Jyn hurled the fruit she had at one of the stormtroopers. She assaulted the stormtroopers and fled with the [[Tooka]]-[[cat]] down an alleyway. The stormtroopers were joined by two reinforcements, so Jyn hid beside a rubbish bin with the cat. As the stormtroopers approached, she shot the drainage hatch with her blaster, causing the stormtroopers to fall into the drain. Jyn returned the pet to the grateful girl who asked her what was her name. Jyn identified herself as Jyn Erso before walking away.<ref name="The Stranger">{{FOD|The Stranger}}</ref>

By the time she was twenty-one, Jyn's rap sheet included warrants for forgery of Imperial documents (listed twice on the rap sheet the Rebel Alliance recovered), aggravated assault against Imperial personnel, escape from custody, resisting arrest, shipjacking, possession of unsanctioned weapons, unlawful conduct with undesirables, petty [[Thief|theft]], creating a public nuisance, and disorderly conduct. Notably, none of her crimes involved harming or conning civilians&mdash;her only targets were Imperial personnel and other criminals.<ref name="Rebel Dossier" /> Despite her rough life, Jyn was also not a murderer, killing only in self-defense, defense of others, or in war.<ref name="Rogue One Novel" /> In [[1 BBY]], one year before joining the Rebellion and her ultimate sacrifice, Erso's voice was heard by [[Padawan]] [[Ezra Bridger]] inside a [[World between worlds|place]] between time and space.<ref name="A World Between Worlds">{{Rebels|A World Between Worlds}}</ref>

====Incarceration====
{{Quote|Next work crew we are on together. I will kill you then.''"<br />"''Who's going to keep you company?''"<br />"''I like a quiet cell.''"<br />"''What if I kill you first?''"<br />"''Then I hope ''you'' like a quiet cell, Liana Hallik.|"Kennel" to Jyn|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (novelization)}}
[[File:Jynandoolin.png|thumb|left|270px|Jyn and Oolin Musters together in their cell]]
In [[0 BBY]],<ref name="Galactic Atlas date">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' places the events of ''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]'' in [[0 BBY]]</ref> Jyn's luck ran out. She was arrested on a ship in the Five Points System while using her Liana Hallik alias.<ref name="Rebel Rising" /> She was eventually transferred to the [[Imperial Detention Center & Labor Camp LEG-817|Imperial labor camp]] on the planet [[Wobani]],<ref name="Rogue One" /> sentenced to twenty years of labor in the planets farms, sharing a cell with a non-human known as "[[Oolin Musters|Kennel]]."<ref name="Rogue One Novel" />

Jyn's only luck was that the Imperials thought she really was Liana Hallik, not realizing her true identity and that they let her keep her kyber crystal [[necklace]], mistaking it for a piece of glass.<ref name="Rebel Rising" /> However, Jyn estimated that she would be dead long before her sentence was up; five years was the maximum life expectancy of a Wobani inmate, she had no friends to rescue her, no guards she could bribe, and Kennel had promised to kill her the next time they were assigned to the same work shift. Jyn hadn't even been able to smuggle a [[knife]] to protect herself.<ref name="Rogue One Novel" />

====Rescue by the Alliance====
{{Quote|Congratulations. You are being rescued. Please do not resist.|K-2SO to Jyn|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story}}
[[File:Rescue of Jyn Erso-Rogue One.png|thumb|right|300px|Jyn being rescued by Rebels on Wobani]]
In the sixth month of Jyn's incarceration,<ref name="Rebel Rising" /> while being [[transport]]ed to her work station one [[Standard day|day]], the vehicle Jyn was aboard was [[Liberation of Erso|attacked]] by [[Extraction Team Bravo]] of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. After identifying Jyn, [[Sergeant]] [[Ruescott Melshi]] released her from her [[Stuncuffs|restraints]] but was distracted by a [[prisoner]] seated opposite, giving Jyn a chance to kick the Rebel over (Jyn had wondered if her "rescuers" were actually sent by Saw because she knew too much about his operations).<ref name="Rogue One Novel" /> Heading for the door, Jyn punched a second [[Rebel trooper]] to the ground before grabbing a shovel from the side wall of the transport, using it to strike the sergeant and the third Bravo Team soldier. Running outside to escape, Erso was clotheslined by former Imperial<ref name="Rogue One" /> [[KX-series security droid]]<ref name="Commander">''[[Star Wars: Commander]]''</ref> [[K-2SO]] who threw her to the ground and told her not to resist, informing her that she was being rescued.<ref name="Rogue One" />

Having been brought to the Rebel Alliance's [[Great Temple (Yavin 4)|secret base]] on the [[moon]] of [[Yavin 4]], Jyn was handed over to [[General]] [[Davits Draven]] and a founder of the Alliance, [[Mon Mothma]]. After reading out her criminal record, Draven introduced Jyn to [[Alliance Intelligence]] [[Intelligence officer|officer]], [[Captain]] [[Cassian Jeron Andor|Cassian Andor]], who asked her when she was last in contact with her father and Saw Gerrera. Confused, irritated and only willing to give vague answers, Jyn demanded explanation. The trio told her that [[Bodhi Rook|an Imperial defector]] claimed to have been tasked by her father to pass information to the Rebel Alliance pertaining to [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|a planet-destroying superweapon]]. Because of her history with Gerrera, Draven and Mothma asked her to [[Battle on Jedha|meet with him]] on the moon [[Jedha]], an Imperial occupied world held sacred by followers of the mystical energy field known as [[the Force]], to acquire the message in the hopes of locating and extracting Galen to testify to the [[Imperial Senate]]. Given a choice between assisting the Rebels and being given her freedom or refusing and being returned to prison, Jyn chose the former. What she wasn't aware of, however, was that Andor had instead been tasked with [[Operation Fracture|assassinating Galen]] by General Draven, who did not trust either Jyn or her father to help them.<ref name="Rogue One" />

Jyn was sent to the [[UT-60D U-wing starfighter/support craft]] that she, Andor and K-2SO would be using for the mission. While waiting, Jyn rummaged through a duffle belonging to Andor, helping herself to a [[A180 pistol|pistol]] she found in it.<ref name="Rogue One Novel" /> When Andor arrived, K-2SO brought to his attention attention that Jyn was armed. Not willing to take the risk, Andor ordered her to hand the blaster over. Refusing, Jyn told him trust goes both ways, convincing Andor to allow her to keep it, even after K-2SO remarked that there was a very high likelihood of Jyn using it on him.<ref name="Rogue One" />

====Mission to Jedha====
{{Quote|So, what is it that you want, Jyn?''"<br>"''They wanted an introduction, they've got it. I'm out now, the rest of you can do what you want.''"<br>"''You care not about the cause?''"<br>"''The cause? Seriously? The Alliance, the, the Rebels, whatever it is you're calling yourself these days, all it's ever brought me is pain.|Saw Gerrera and Jyn|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story|audio=Jyn & Saw-Introduction.ogg}}
[[File:JynFirefightOnJedha.png|thumb|left|300px|Jyn during the firefight in the Holy City.]]
Arriving at Jedha, Jyn and Andor agreed that Kaytoo should stay behind on the [[Bravo One|ship]] so that they could blend into the crowds of the [[Jedha City|Holy City]] more easily. After entering the [[city]], Jyn was surprised to find that Andor was relying on the hope of her name being enough to get a meeting with Saw, being told in response that "Rebellions are built on hope." Shortly after, Jyn encountered [[Chirrut Îmwe]], a blind male [[human]] who called her over. Îmwe told her about the [[Guardians of the Whills]] and their [[Temple of the Kyber|great temple]], and how the Empire was at Jedha for the planet's kyber crystals. Her conversation was cut short when Andor called her over, telling her to keep her focus on the mission. Walking further, the pair came out onto a street where they noticed an [[TX-225 GAVw "Occupier" combat assault tank|Imperial combat assault tank]] guarded by several stormtroopers approaching. Out of the corner of her [[eye]], Jyn spotted several people armed with weapons atop the surrounding buildings. Suddenly the Imperials were attacked from all sides. After getting to cover, Jyn noticed a [[Pendra Siliu|child]] stranded in the midst of the engagement. Running to retrieve the girl, Jyn handed her over to<ref name="Rogue One" /> her [[Huika Siliu|mother]]<ref name="Visual Guide" /> but was subsequently trapped on either side by [[Imperial Military|Imperial forces]]. Andor, spotting one of the insurgents preparing to throw an explosive, shot the rebel, causing him to fall and detonate the explosive inside a group of insurgents, providing enough distraction for Jyn to escape to cover. With the insurgents neutralizing the last of the Imperial forces surrounding the [[Tank (vehicle)|tank]], they retrieved the kyber crystals being transported on-board. As Jyn and Andor tried to escape, a group of stormtroopers caught up with them. Finding cover in the indent of a building, Jyn extended her [[baton]] and struck a pair of stormtroopers down; using a scavenged [[E-11 blaster rifle]], Jyn fired at another pair of troopers approaching from around the corner before turning and shooting a<ref name="Rogue One" /> KX-series [[security droid]].<ref name="Commander" /> Unsure if she had just killed K-2SO, the droid fell revealing the true Kaytoo standing behind, chagrined at the fact that she might have shot him. Walking over to one of the stormtroopers recovering from being struck by Jyn, Kaytoo caught the soldier's [[C-25 fragmentation grenade|grenade]] mid-flight and threw it backwards into a group of approaching troopers, all the while chastising them for their decision to leave him on the ship.<ref name="Rogue One" />

[[File:Reunited with Saw.png|thumb|300px|right|Jyn is reunited with Saw Gerrera after many years.]]
Rounding a corner, the trio found themselves in front of another stormtrooper patrol. One of the stormtroopers ordered Kaytoo to tell him where he was taking the "prisoners." Before they were able to give an answer, the troopers told Kaytoo they will handle the prisoners. Before they could however, the blind [[monk]] that had spoken to Jyn approached the group. Ordered to stay back by one of the stormtroopers, Îmwe kept walking. As the troopers fired, the [[robe]]d man used his hands and his [[Chirrut's staff|staff]] strike the soldiers down, using some of them as cover from blaster bolts. When the last trooper was down, another group came around the corner but were suddenly killed when a human named [[Baze Malbus]], armed with [[Baze's repeating cannon|a]] [[heavy repeater cannon]], came up from behind. With the fighting ended, several of Gerrera's insurgents approached. Jyn demanded that she speak with Gerrera, telling the rebels that she was Galen Erso's daughter. Speaking in an [[alien]] [[language]], [[Benthic|one of the insurgents]] ordered they all be restrained and brought to Gerrera.<ref name="Rogue One" />

Having arrived by foot at Gerrera's [[Catacombs of Cadera|hidden base]] far from the city, Andor, Îmwe and Malbus, were placed in a cell adjacent to the one holding the Imperial defector, while Jyn was led to Gerrera. Coming face to face, Gerrera greeted her but noticed her obvious anger. Asking if they were still friends, Jyn scolded him for abandoning her, to which Gerrera defended himself by telling her that her history endangered him and his insurgency, just as much as she was endangered by being with them. Asking why she was at Jedha, Jyn explained the task she was set by the Alliance.

[[File:Jyn watching Galen's Message.png|thumb|300px|left|Jyn watches her father's holographic message.]]
Taking out a small [[holoprojector]], Gerrera placed it on the ground and activated it, producing a [[hologram]] recording of Jyn's father. The message played, revealing that Galen had accepted a job to develop the superweapon equipped [[battle station]], which the Empire was calling the "Death Star," in order to purposefully [[engineer]] a flaw in the form of a vulnerable [[thermal exhaust port]] leading directly to the station's [[reactor]]. Galen went on to speak directly to his daughter, causing Jyn to burst into tears. He said that in order to find the exhaust port, one had to steal the station's [[Death Star plans|plans]]. As the message ended, the building began to shake violently and Andor, who had escaped with Îmwe, Malbus and the former Imperial pilot, Bodhi Rook, ran up to her and told her that they needed to leave. Regaining composure, Jyn told Gerrera to come with them, but he refused, telling her that he was done running. As the group escaped towards the vast wall of rubble created by the Death Star's [[Destruction of Jedha City|test firing]] on the holy city, Kaytoo landed the U-wing in front of them and allowed the five of them to board the vessel before escaping into hyperspace.<ref name="Rogue One" />

While in hyperspace, Andor received a transmission from the Alliance informing him that the [[assassin]]ation operation was still in effect. With Bodhi having informed them that Galen was currently located on the storm-stricken planet of [[Eadu]], Jyn told them about the hologram message and that they need to find him. However, Andor had doubts and asked her if she had the message on her. Jyn told him everything happened so fast during their escape, and that she didn't have a chance to retrieve it. Asking if anyone else saw the message, Andor received shaking heads, causing Jyn to become angry and admonish them for not believing her.<ref name="Rogue One" />

====Encounter on Eadu====
{{Quote|Wh-what do you mean 'does he look like a killer'?''"<br>"''The Force moves darkly near a creature that's about to kill.''"<br>"''His weapon ''was'' in the sniper configuration.|Jyn, Îmwe and K-2SO, regarding Andor|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story|audio=Jyn Chirrut & K-2SO-Killer.ogg}}
[[File:Galen's Death.png|thumb|right|300px|Jyn holds her dying father in her arms.]]
Entering Eadu's stormy [[atmosphere]], Kaytoo and Andor struggled to guide the vessel between the planet's immense rock pillars as they listened to Rook's vague directions. As they approached the Imperial [[Eadu Flight Station|Flight Station]], the U-wing's right engine hit one of the cliffs, causing the ship to crash. Confirming no-one was injured or killed, Andor proceeded to depart with Rook, telling the group they were leaving to conduct reconnaissance. However, in reality, Andor was leaving to assassinate Galen. Unwilling to stay in the U-wing, Jyn left to follow them, while Îmwe and Malbus in turn followed her. Upon reaching a cliff that Andor and Rook had passed, Jyn surveyed the shuttle depot ahead and realized her father was likely there, and so headed for the ladder leading up to the platform. Suddenly, [[ST 149|Krennic's shuttle]] passed overhead, landing at the end of a platform. When she reached the top, Jyn pulled a stormtrooper off the edge and picked up his [[blaster rifle]]. Before she could do anything however, the platform was [[Mission to Eadu|attacked]] by [[Rebel Alliance Starfighter Corps|Rebel Alliance]] [[T-65B X-wing starfighter|X-wing starfighters]] that had been sent after the group's presumed demise, with the attack killing most of the stormtroopers. As Krennic ordered Galen into the shuttle, Jyn shouted out to her father. When Galen tried to comprehend what he was seeing, he was struck by a blast from a [[BTL-A4 Y-wing assault starfighter/bomber|Y-wing's]] [[proton torpedo]]. As Jyn lay on the ground, Krennic hastily looked back before boarding his shuttle. As the [[Color|black]] vessel turned, Jyn made her way over to her father but was pushed back by the force of the shuttle's [[sublight engine]]s. However, she managed to hold on to the edge of the platform. Getting back atop the platform, Jyn ran over to Galen and tuned him over. Jyn told him that she got his message and after a brief exchange, Galen died in her arms as the cause of death for Galen was the rebel explosion. Andor, who had spotted Jyn through the scope of [[Cassian Andor's blaster|his]] [[A280-CFE blaster]], came up to Jyn and told her they needed to leave, telling her Galen was dead and that she couldn't do anything about it. As they regrouped, a squad of stormtroopers caught up with them and were preparing to fire. However, an [[Zeta-class cargo shuttle|Imperial Cargo Shuttle]] piloted by Rook and Kaytoo rose up behind the Rebels, taking out the stormtroopers with its forward [[laser cannon]]s. After all the Rebels were aboard, the shuttle took off, heading for Yavin 4. As they traveled through hyperspace, Jyn confronted Andor, realizing he was going to kill her father. Andor became angry and told her that some don't have the luxury to make their own choices and that, even though he had the chance to, he didn't kill Galen.<ref name="Rogue One" />

====Return to Yavin====
{{Quote|I'm not used to people sticking around when things go bad.|Jyn, to Andor|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story|audio=Jyn-Sticking Around.ogg}}
[[File:JynBeforetheAllianceHighCommand.png|thumb|left|325px|Jyn attempts to convince the Alliance High Command of her cause.]]
Arriving back at the Rebel base, a meeting of the [[Alliance Cabinet]] was held to discuss how the Rebellion should deal with the Death Star. Most of the group agreed that, against such a destructive weapon, the Alliance stood no chance of stealing the plans and that the word of a "criminal" was not enough to take such a risk. Jyn interjected, telling them it wasn't a matter of chance, but one of choice and that if they let such power remain in the hands of such an evil government then they condemn the [[galaxy]] indefinitely to a future of oppression. Her speech was enough to sway many of the council members, but without full support from everyone, the chances were too great and no action could be taken. Irritated with the council's unwillingness to act, Jyn stormed off.<ref name="Rogue One" />

Inside one of the Great Temple's [[hangar]]s, Andor approached Jyn with a group of [[Rebel Marine]]s behind him. Agreeing with her that they have to do something, Andor offered his service, telling her he couldn't live with himself if he gave up. Îmwe, Malbus and Rook soon followed suit, with Kaytoo telling her he would fight with her, but only because Andor said he had to.<ref name="Rogue One" />

Boarding their [[SW-0608|appropriated Imperial shuttle]], the group prepared for takeoff but received a message from an Alliance member telling them they were not cleared to leave the base and that they had to give a [[callsign]]. Desperately trying to think of one, Rook replied with "[[Rogue One (squad)|Rogue One]]," but was told there was no "Rogue One." Before the Alliance member could say another word, Rook lifted the ship off the ground and took off from the moon and plotted a [[Hyperspace route|course]] for [[Scarif]], the location of the Death Star plans.<ref name="Rogue One" />

===Galactic Civil War===
====Infiltrating Scarif====
{{Quote|They've no idea we're coming. They've no reason to expect us. If we can make it to the ground, we'll take the next chance, and the next, on and on until we win, or the chances are spent.|Jyn addressing Rogue One|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story|audio=Jyn-Take The Next Chance.ogg}}
As the shuttle exited hyperspace, Scarif and its enveloping [[Planetary shield|planetary]] [[deflector shield]] came into view. As they headed towards the [[Shield Gate]] that would allow them access to the surface, Rook notified gate control and requested a landing pad. After informing them that their arrival was not scheduled, Rook told [[Unidentified Shield Gate officer|the]] [[gate officer]] that they had been rerouted from Eadu and ordered Kaytoo to transmit the clearance codes. As they waited for a reply, Jyn clutched her kyber crystal. A few [[second]]s later, the reply came through, and they were granted entry. As everyone expressed their relief, Jyn headed into the cargo section to tell the others.<ref name="Rogue One" /> While there, she was approached by [[Alliance Special Forces|Special Forces]] [[Lieutenant]] [[Taidu Sefla]] who expressed his concern that the troops would have trouble respecting her without legitimate authority. Thus, Jyn became an official member of the Alliance with the [[Military rank|rank]] of sergeant.<ref name="Rogue One Novel" /> Jyn proceeded to address the Marines on the situation while Andor detailed the [[Battle of Scarif|mission]] and their role in it.<ref name="Rogue One" />

[[File:Jyn Erso Cassian Andor disguises.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jyn disguised herself in the armor of [[Kent Deezling]] in order to infiltrate the Imperial facility on Scarif.]]
After the shuttle settled down on [[landing pad nine]], an inspection crew consisting of two stormtroopers, an [[officer]], and a [[Imperial ground crew|ground technician]], boarded. When they descended into the cargo bay to check the ship's supposed [[Cargo manifest|manifest]], the four Imperials were taken out. After donning their disguises, Jyn and Andor along with Kaytoo left for the [[Imperial security complex|facility]] while the Marines sneaked out through the underside the ship. While the trio headed through the complex, the others began preparing for the diversion by planting explosives at various landing pads. Finding a lone KX-series droid, Kaytoo [[Slicer|accessed]] its data banks and retrieved a map of the complex. Discovering there were too many stormtroopers to make it to [[Scarif vault|the data vault]], Andor ordered Melshi to detonate the explosives to divert the Imperial forces away.<ref name="Rogue One" />

Making it without resistance to the [[data vault]], Kaytoo knocked out [[Milton Putna|the]] [[technician]] in charge of the vault and assumed control over the [[computer]]. After opening the door, Kaytoo informed them that the [[Alliance Fleet]] had amassed over Scarif and that the Shield Gate had been closed. When Jyn realized they were trapped, Kaytoo suggested transmitting the plans but told them that the size of the data files meant that the shield would have to be taken down to in order to send them to the [[fleet]]. Before she left into the vault, Jyn handed Kaytoo a [[SE-14r light repeating blaster|blaster pistol]] recovered from the unconscious Putna and the droid told her that her behavior was continually unexpected.

[[File:Citadel data vault.png|thumb|left|275px|Jyn and Cassian inside the data vault]]
As Jyn and Andor skimmed through the files in search of the plans, a group of stormtroopers approached Kaytoo and saw the technician's body on the floor. Kaytoo attempted to divert the stormtroopers to supposed "Rebels," but Andor asked through comms why he had closed the vault door, forcing the droid to take out the soldiers. Jyn continued to search through the files and stopped at "stardust," the same nickname her father gave her, and realized that they must be the plans. As Kaytoo tried to fight off stormtrooper reinforcements, he read out the [[data-tape]]'s position. Andor used the retrieving mechanism to get it, however, before he could fully extract it the door control was shot and the device's power went out. Kaytoo implored them to climb and locked the vault before being killed by stormtroopers. Jyn shot the glass and jumped across onto the data tower, with Andor following after her. After she retrieved the data-tape, they climbed up to escape, but before they could a door opened in the wall revealing Krennic and a pair of death troopers. Andor covered Jyn's escape, killing the two death troopers before a bolt from Krennic caused him to fall and hit a platform unconscious. Jyn, knowing she couldn't save him, continued climbing. Reaching a continuously opening and closing hatch, Jyn timed her escape, climbing through the malfunctioning exit just in time.<ref name="Rogue One" />

Reaching the top of the [[Citadel Tower]], Jyn inserted the data-tape into a console connected to the large dish above her. However, the computer told her that the dish was misaligned. Making her way across an extended platform to the orientation control, Jyn aligned the dish with the Rebel fleet but noticed a [[TIE/sk x1 experimental air superiority fighter|TIE striker]] heading in her direction. Moving hastily back to the transmission console, the [[starfighter]] fired at the platform, pushing Jyn backwards and forcing her to grab hold of a railing to prevent falling to the ground. Getting back atop the platform, Jyn once again made her way over to the console but was stopped by Krennic. Demanding Jyn tell him who she was, she told him she was Jyn Erso, daughter of Galen and Lyra. She then told Krennic about the fatal flaw that her father had placed in the Death Star, describing it as a "fuse in the middle of [Krennic's] machine", and that she'd just "told the entire galaxy how to light it." Krennic dismisses this, reminding Jyn that the shield was still up and that he'd kill her before she cold transmit the plans to the other Rebels. However, before he could, Andor emerged and shot Krennic, rendering him unconscious. Jyn ran over to the console and managed to transmit the plans to the Rebel vessel ''[[Profundity]]'' before going over to Andor to brace him. Following the captain's gaze to Krennic, Jyn tried to run over to him in anger but was stopped by Andor, who calmed her down. Unknown to them, Îmwe, Malbus and Bodhi had all already died.<ref name="Rogue One" />

====Death====
{{Quote|Your father would've been proud of you, Jyn.|Andor's final words to Jyn|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story|audio=Cassian-Final Words.ogg}}
[[File:Jyn-cassian death.png|thumb|300px|right|Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor, moments before becoming one with the Force]]
Exiting the [[turbolift]] onto the [[beach]], Jyn and Andor looked into the distance to see that the Death Star had fired its superlaser at a point several [[kilometer]]s away. Knowing that the plans were safe with the Alliance, Jyn accepted her fate as the resulting blast approached them, and she and Andor shared one last embrace before being engulfed<ref name="Rogue One" /> and becoming one with the Force.<ref name="Rogue One Novel" />

===Legacy===
{{Quote|In a kinder universe, she would have walked away from Scarif. I cannot imagine who she would have become, but I think she would have been extraordinary.|Mon Mothma reflecting on Jyn's short life|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (novelization)}}
Jyn's determination and bravery led to her becoming one of the most important figures of the war. Her actions allowed the Rebel Alliance to [[Battle of Yavin|exploit]] the Death Star's weakness with the help of [[Luke Skywalker]]<ref name="ANH">[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]</ref> and pave the way for the Empire's defeat at the [[Battle of Jakku]] [[5 ABY|five years later]].<ref name="Lost Stars">''[[Lost Stars]]''</ref> She was also part of the catalyst that lead the Rebel Alliance becoming a truly unified force instead of the unstable conglomeration that existed prior.<ref name="Rogue One Novel" />

[[Ubin Des]] revered Jyn and lamented that she was unable to join her at Scarif having been confined to [[sick bay]] at the time. Having been told only a little about the mission, Luke Skywalker wished to know more about the late rebel.<ref name="SW 39">''[[Star Wars 39: The Ashes of Jedha, Part II]]''</ref>

[[File:Exds.png|thumb|left|250px|Jyn's efforts to obtain the plans on Scarif allowed the Rebel Alliance to destroy the first Death Star at the Battle of Yavin.]]
In retrospect, the popular assessment of Jyn's choice to go on the mission to Scarif was with the deliberate intent of becoming a martyr, having lost everything. Mothma herself strongly disagreed. In her [[writing]]s, when talking about her two brief meetings with Jyn, Mothma presented the case that Jyn had wanted to put the best and worst qualities of herself to a cause she found worthy and found that in the Scarif mission. While admitting that she didn't know for sure what would've happened, Mothma also expressed the opinion that Jyn would've gone on to an extraordinary life had she lived.<ref name="Rogue One Novel" />

Jyn Erso was remembered long after the Galactic Civil War and was mentioned alongside Krennic and K2-2SO by a [[Second Whill (From a Certain Point of View)|member]] of the [[Whills (community)|Whills]] as someone to be remembered in [[Timeline of galactic history|galactic history]].<ref name="Whills">{{Shortstory|story=Whills|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>

==Personality and traits==
[[File:JynErsoScarif.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Sergeant Jyn Erso during the Battle of Scarif.]]
{{Quote|Jyn, I think, never knew the effect she had on others&mdash;never realized the intensity of her own humanity or the presence she brought to a room. She was, as expected, troubled and quarrelsome; she was also impossible to ignore or forget.|Mon Mothma|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (novelization)}}
Standing at 1.6 [[meter]]s in height,<ref name="Visual Guide" /> Jyn Erso was a human female with short brown [[hair]], green eyes, and light skin.<ref name="Rogue One" /> Even as a small child, Jyn began developing a rebellious attitude<ref name="Catalyst" /> but had a clear sense of right and wrong gained from her parents while growing up on Lah'mu.<ref name="Visual Guide" /> During her time with Saw Gerrera's insurgents, she developed a strong bond with the extremists. After being abandoned at sixteen, Jyn was forced to adapt and developed fighting skills and a keen knowledge of the galactic underworld.<ref name="Visual Guide" /> Initially, Jyn cared little about the Rebels' cause, but after watching the hologram message from her father, Jyn realized how important it was that the Empire be rid from the galaxy and sacrificed herself for their cause.<ref name="Rogue One" />

As a result of being trained by Saw Gerrera and being abandoned, she wielded a calm yet cold demeanor in interactions with others or when completing tasks. That being said, the pain she held on to was expressed when seeing her father's hologram message, becoming teary-eyed, falling to her knees once the message had finished. In addition, she was aggressive and distrusting, fighting off the Rebellion squad that was sent to rescue her, and keeping others at arms length until the battle at Scarif. Despite her aggressive and cold demeanor, she showed herself to be selfless and caring, saving a [[Youngling|child]] from death during a battle against stormtroopers on Jedha.<ref name="Rogue One" />

Jyn's relationship with Andor was complicated, as the two didn't trust one another when meeting. After learning that the Alliance ordered him to kill Galen, she learned of his experience from the war, and the two would later become respectful allies once they disobey orders and headed to Scarif. Her relationship with K-2S0 was distasteful, with the latter having restrained her when she attacked the squad that was sent to rescue her. Despite this, K-2S0 showed himself to care for Jyn, saying he will do anything for her, and sacrificing himself for her and Andor in his last moments.<ref name="Rogue One" />

==Behind the scenes==
Jyn Erso was created by [[John Knoll]] for the [[2016]] [[Star Wars Anthology Series|film]] ''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''. Knoll created the character as a role model for his daughters and developed her as part of his original story for the film, circa 2003.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/12/star-wars-rogue-one-john-knoll-visual-effects|title=The Star Wars Saga's Secret Weapon: A Visual Effects Nerd with a Big Story to Tell|publisher=Vanity Fair|last=King|first=Darryn|date=December 12, 2016|accessdate=December 13, 2016}}</ref> [[Felicity Jones]] was announced to play the role on [[March 12]], [[2015]].<ref name="Jones Casting">{{SW|url=news/rogue-one-is-the-first-star-wars-stand-alone-film-rian-johnson-to-write-and-direct-star-wars-episode-viii|text=''Rogue One'' is the First ''Star Wars'' Stand-Alone Film, Rian Johnson to Write and Direct ''Star Wars'': Episode VIII}}</ref> The first photo of Jyn was released during the 2015 D23 Expo,<ref name="Rogue One SW.com">{{SW|url=news/rogue-one-the-daring-mission-has-begun-cast-and-crew-announced|text=''Rogue One''&mdash;The Daring Mission Has Begun: Cast and Crew Announced}}</ref> and the first footage of the character was shown in the ''Rogue One'' teaser trailer on [[April 7]], 2016.<ref name="Teaser">{{SW|url=video/rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-official-teaser-trailer|text=Rogue One: A Star Wars Story Official Teaser Trailer}}</ref> While Jyn appeared in trailers facing a recitation of a list of past crimes and stating "''This is a rebellion, isn't it?

Felicity Jones reprised her role in the [[Forces of Destiny: Season One|first season]] of the animated microseries, ''[[Star Wars: Forces of Destiny]]''. In later appearances, Jyn's voice was provided by [[Helen Sadler]].

In an earlier draft of ''Rogue One'', Jyn was to be given the rank of sergeant. This was cut from the final film, although several pieces of merchandise still identified her as "Sergeant Jyn Erso".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/03/20/rogue-one-alternate-ending-revealed/|title=Rogue One alternate ending revealed: A lifesaving escape|accessdate=2017-03-22|author=Anthnony Breznican|authorlink=http://ew.com/author/anthony-breznican/|date=March 20, 2017|work=http://ew.com|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20170320150711/http://ew.com/movies/2017/03/20/rogue-one-alternate-ending-revealed/|archivedate=March 20, 2017}}</ref> Upon the movie's release, ''[[Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide]]''<ref name="Visual Guide" /> and the film's [[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (novelization)|novelization]] confirmed that Jyn was in fact given the rank of sergeant by Lieutenant Taidu Sefla during the team's descent onto Scarif.<ref name="Rogue One Novel" />
