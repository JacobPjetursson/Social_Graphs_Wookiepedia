'''Agen Kolar''' was a member of the [[Jedi Order]] in the [[Galactic Republic]]. In addition to being a member of the Order, Kolar was a Zabrak [[Jedi Master]], a notable [[Lightsaber duel|duelist]], and also sat on the [[Jedi High Council]]. He was [[Death|killed]] by [[Darth Sidious]] in a [[lightsaber]] [[Duel in Palpatine's office|duel]].

==Biography==
===Early Life===
Agen Kolar was born on [[Coruscant]] prior to the [[Separatist Crisis]]. He was found to be [[Force-sensitive]] and brought to the [[Jedi Temple]] to be trained as a [[Jedi]]. He eventually rose up to the [[rank]] of [[Jedi Master]].<ref name="ECUC" /> He soon gained a [[Padawan]] called [[Tan Yuster]].<ref name="Lightsabers" />

===Battle of Geonosis===
[[File:Kolar-Geonosis.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Kolar during the first Battle of Geonosis]]
Agen Kolar participated in the [[Battle of Geonosis]], the conflict that sparked the [[Clone Wars]] between the [[Galactic Republic]] and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist Alliance]]. As a participant, [[Sexes|he]] was a member of the [[Jedi assault team]] assembled by fellow [[Jedi High Council]] member [[Mace Windu]] to rescue [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], [[Anakin Skywalker]], and [[Padmé Amidala]] from being [[Death|executed]] by the Separatists.<ref name="Attack of the Clones" /> During the battle, Kolar's [[padawan]] [[Tan Yuster]] was overwhelmed by [[B2 super battle droid]]s and [[Death|killed]]. The Jedi Master recovered the blue [[kyber crystal]] from his fallen apprentice's [[lightsaber]] and later added it to [[Agen Kolar's lightsaber|his own]] as an homage.<ref name="Lightsabers" />

===Yoda's vision===
In the last [[Standard year|year]] of the Clone Wars, [[Grand Master]] [[Yoda]] experienced a [[Force vision|vision]] of Kolar's death at the hands of [[Darth Sidious]] whilst on the [[planet]] [[Dagobah]] to learn the secrets of immortality.<ref name="Voices">{{TCW|Voices}}</ref>

===Discussions on the Jedi Council===
In [[19 BBY]], Kolar replaced Eeth Koth on the Jedi High Council<ref name="Revenge of the Sith" /> after Koth was kicked off it.<ref name="Darth Vader 19">''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 19: Fortress Vader, Part I]]''</ref> He took part in many important discussions such as when [[Supreme Chancellor]] Palpatine requested that Skywalker be appointed to be on the Jedi Council. He was also present when Palpatine reported that [[General]] [[Grievous]] was hiding on [[Utapau]] and suggested that they dispatch [[Jedi Knight]] Anakin Skywalker. The Council instead [[Battle of Utapau|dispatched]] [[Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]].<ref name="Revenge of the Sith" />

===Death===
[[File:TheDeathofAgenKolar.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Kolar is struck down by Darth Sidious.]]
During the final [[Standard day|days]] of the war, Kolar was part of another team assembled by Windu, this [[time]] to [[Duel in Palpatine's office|arrest]] Palpatine&mdash;who, up until that point, had secretly been [[Darth]] Sidious, the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]]. Of the four [[Jedi]] Masters sent to [[Duel in Palpatine's office|arrest]] the Dark [[Lord]], Kolar was the first to be [[Death|killed]]. The other three Masters also perished, and Sidious [[Proclamation of the New Order|transformed]] the Republic into the [[Galactic Empire]] and [[Order 66|destroyed]] the [[Jedi Order]].<ref name="Revenge of the Sith" />

==Personality and traits==
Agen Kolar was known to strike first and ask questions later. He was also considered a valuable member of the Jedi Council. Mace Windu had a high opinion of Kolar's combat skills, which led to Windu recruiting him to attempt to arrest Supreme Chancellor Palpatine.<ref name="ECUC" />

==Powers and abilities==
He was a master swordsman of the Jedi Order, and his lightsaber skills were widely celebrated and renowned.<ref name="ECUC" /> Despite Kolar's reputation, however, Darth Sidious was able to slay the [[Zabrak]] Jedi with a single blow.<ref name="Revenge of the Sith" />

==Equipment==
Kolar built his lightsaber in such a way that it used dual [[Kyber crystal|crystals]], which allowed the [[color]] of the lightsaber to be either blue or green.<ref name="ECUC" />

==Behind the scenes==
Agen Kolar was first created by ''[[Star Wars]]'' creator [[George Lucas]], who originally intended for Kolar to be the character [[Eeth Koth]] in [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']].{{Fact}}However, there are several differences between the characters' physical characteristics that Koth had that Kolar lacked. Lucasfilm soon decided to create a new character: Agen Kolar. Kolar was created as a new character for [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']].{{Fact}} He went on to appear in [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']],<ref name="Revenge of the Sith" /> and he appeared in a vision in "[[Voices]]," an episode of the animated television series [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'']].<ref name="Voices" /> It is however the model of Eeth Koth that is used during the brief scene.{{Fact}}
