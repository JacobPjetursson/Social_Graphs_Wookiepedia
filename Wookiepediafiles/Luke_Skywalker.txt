{{Quote|I am a Jedi, like my father before me.|Luke Skywalker|audio=I am a Jedi like my father before me.ogg|Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi}}
'''Luke Skywalker''', a [[Force-sensitive]] [[human]] [[Sexes|male]], was a [[Jedi Knight]] who fought for the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] during the [[Galactic Civil War]]. The son of [[Jedi General]] [[Anakin Skywalker]] and [[Senator]] [[Padmé Amidala]], Skywalker was [[Reproduction|born]] in the [[Standard year|year]] [[19 BBY]]&mdash;two [[Standard day|days]] after the [[Proclamation of the New Order|end]] of the [[Clone Wars]] and the [[Empire Day|birth]] of the [[Galactic Empire]]&mdash;alongside his [[twin]] sister, [[Leia Organa|Leia Amidala Skywalker]]. With [[the galaxy]] under the [[New Order|dominion]] of the [[Sith]], the Skywalker siblings were separated at birth. Luke was sent to live with his [[Lars family|relatives]] on the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] [[planet]] [[Tatooine]] while Leia was adopted into [[House Organa]] and raised as a [[prince]]ss of [[Alderaan]]. For two [[Standard decade|decades]] Skywalker had no knowledge of his [[Jedi]] heritage or his connection to [[the Force]] until a fateful encounter with [[Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] in [[0 BBY]]. Through Kenobi, Skywalker learned that his [[Parent|father]] was once a Jedi Knight of the [[Galactic Republic|Old Republic]] and ultimately sought to follow in Anakin's example by becoming a Jedi as well.

With the aid of the [[smuggler]]s [[Han Solo]] and [[Chewbacca]], Skywalker and Kenobi embarked on a journey to Alderaan only to be captured and taken aboard the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]], the Empire's [[moon]]-sized [[battle station]] that possessed the [[Superweapon|capacity]] to destroy entire planets. Upon learning that Princess Leia Organa was also a [[prisoner]] aboard the station, Skywalker and his allies took the opportunity to [[Rescue of Princess Leia|rescue]] the [[Alderaanian]] [[Alderaanian monarchy|royal]] but at the cost of his mentor Kenobi, who became [[Force spirit|one with the Force]] as a result of a [[Lightsaber duel|final duel]] with his one-[[time]] [[Padawan|apprentice]], the fallen Jedi-turned-[[Sith Lord]] [[Darth]] Vader. Committing himself to the cause of the Rebellion, Skywalker participated in the [[Battle of Yavin]] where he succeeded in destroying the Death Star. As his [[Force power|powers]] continued to grow, Skywalker journeyed to [[Dagobah]] where he hoped to complete his [[Jedi training|training]] under [[Yoda]], the last [[Grand Master]] of the [[Jedi Order]]. However, Vader exploited Skywalker's emotional attachment to his friends, using them as bait to lure the young Jedi hopeful out of hiding. The result was [[Duel on Cloud City|a duel]] on [[Cloud City]], [[Bespin]] where Skywalker was defeated and maimed by the Sith [[Lord]]. Vader, who was keenly aware of the boy's immense potential in the Force, revealed that he was, in fact, Anakin Skywalker. He beseeched Skywalker to join him, insisting that they could rule the [[galaxy]] together as father and son, but Skywalker refused and was able to regroup with the Rebels.

Skywalker eventually came to terms with the revelation that Anakin Skywalker and Darth Vader were one and the same. However, in spite of Vader's immersion in the dark side, Skywalker perceived the goodness that endured within his father and was convinced that he could be restored to the [[light side of the Force]]. In [[4 ABY]] he confronted his father for the last time but was then brought before Vader's [[Sith Master]], [[Darth Sidious]], the reigning [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] and [[Galactic Emperor]]. The Emperor goaded Skywalker by tempting him with the dark side, resulting in a final duel in which Skywalker prevailed against Vader yet remained steadfast in his commitment to the Jedi way by refusing to strike down his own father. Angered by this turn of events, the Emperor [[torture]]d the self-proclaimed Jedi Knight with a torrent of [[Force lightning]] while Vader was forced to watch his son writhe in agony. To the Emperor's surprise, however, Vader did indeed turn as his son had hoped, ending Sidious' life but at the cost of his own. The deaths of the last two Sith Lords brought the Force back into balance, thereby fulfilling the ancient Jedi prophecy that foretold the destruction of the Sith. By sacrificing his life, Luke's father found redemption in his final moments of life and therefore died in the light as Anakin Skywalker&mdash;the [[Chosen One]] of the Force.

By the [[Galactic Concordance|end]] of the Galactic Civil War in [[5 ABY]], Skywalker stood as the last of the Jedi. Yoda's dying wish was that Skywalker would pass on his lessons to a new generation of Jedi Knights; therefore, Skywalker ultimately founded a [[Luke Skywalker's Jedi Temple|training temple]] where he served as the Jedi Master of a dozen students. Among his acolytes was the young but powerful [[Kylo Ren|Ben Solo]], his sister's son from her [[marriage]] to Han Solo. For a time Skywalker believed that the Jedi Order would, in fact, rise again with the younger Solo as his eventual successor. It was Skywalker's hope that he would not die as the last Jedi, but then he gradually came to sense the rising darkness within Solo and grew fearful for the people he loved. For a brief moment, Skywalker considered ending Solo's life before his dark future could come to pass, causing Solo to lash out by [[Destruction of Luke Skywalker's Jedi Temple|destroying the temple]] and slaughtering the other apprentices. Losing his nephew to the dark side filled Skywalker with shame and remorse; disillusioned by the destruction of his life's work, he elected to live out his remaining years in [[Exile (punishment)|exile]] on [[Ahch-To]], the lost [[homeworld]] of the Jedi Order, as a [[hermit]]. Though he fully intended to remain outside of the [[First Order–Resistance war|galactic conflict]] between the [[First Order]] and the [[Resistance]], Skywalker ultimately embraced his heritage once more, [[Force projection|sacrificing his life]] in [[34 ABY]] in order to save his sister's movement. Skywalker had passed away into the Force, but his legend would spread across the galaxy, bringing hope to the enemies of the First Order. In addition, the Jedi Order did not die with him as [[Rey]], a [[scavenger]] from [[Jakku]], inherited the mantle of the Jedi upon Skywalker's death.

==Biography==
===Pre-birth===
{{Quote|He is to teach one that will save the universe from a great imbalance.|Serenity, concerning Yoda's future training of Luke Skywalker|Destiny (episode)}}
[[File:Epguide612.png|thumb|left|300px|During Yoda's training, the Force Priestesses prophesied the coming of another Skywalker.]]
During the [[Clone Wars]], [[Jedi Master]] [[Yoda]] set out on a journey to discover the secrets of [[Force spirit|immortality]]. His journey took him to [[Moraband]], the ancient [[Sith]] homeworld, where he faced [[Force vision|visions]] of the future. At the end of his journey, the [[Force Priestesses|Force Priestess]], [[Serenity]], who guided his journey told him that there was another Skywalker, and Yoda heard his voice from the future say so as well.<ref name="Sacrifice">{{TCW|Sacrifice}}</ref> These events alluded to the birth and destiny of Luke Skywalker, as well as his [[twin]] sister [[Leia Organa|Leia]].<ref name="Episode VI" />

===Early life===
====Birth====
{{Quote|It's a boy.''"<br />"''Luke.|Obi-Wan Kenobi and Padmé Amidala|audio=PadmeDroid-LukesBirth.ogg|Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith}}
[[File:Midwife droid 1.png|thumb|right|300px|The son of Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala, Luke Skywalker was born mere days after the formation of the Galactic Empire.]]
Luke Skywalker was [[Reproduction|born]] in [[19 BBY]]<ref name="GA" /> on the [[asteroid]] of [[Polis Massa]]<ref name="Episode III" /> two [[Standard day|days]] after the [[Proclamation of the New Order|proclamation]] of the [[Galactic Empire]].<ref name="Siege of Lothal Recon" /> He and his twin sister Leia, who was born shortly after him, were the children of [[Galactic Republic]] [[Senator]] [[Padmé Amidala]], who [[Death|died]] shortly after labor, and [[Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker]], who had recently fallen to the [[dark side of the Force]]. To protect the children from the Empire and Anakin, the now-[[Sith Lord]] Darth Vader, [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] personally sent the infant Luke to live with Anakin's stepbrother [[Owen Lars]] and his [[Marriage|wife]] [[Beru Whitesun Lars|Beru]] on the [[planet]] [[Tatooine]], while Senator [[Bail Organa]] agreed to adopt Leia together with his wife, the [[Breha Organa|queen of Alderaan]].<ref name="Episode III" />

====First years on the farm====
{{Quote|And what of the boy.''"<br />"''To Tatooine. To his family, send him.|Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda discuss Skywalker's future|Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith}}
[[File:Baby luke.png|thumb|left|300px|Skywalker was sent away to live with his relatives on Tatooine.]]
Skywalker spent his youth on the [[Lars family|Lars]]' [[Lars moisture farm|moisture farm]], where his uncle unsuccessfully tried to discourage his adventurous tendencies, telling him that his father had been "a [[navigator]] on a [[spice]] [[freighter]]" during the Clone Wars.<ref name="Episode IV" /> His aunt, Beru, would read him storybooks; one day, when his uncle had business in [[Mos Eisley]], she took Skywalker to [[Anchorhead]] to use the [[HoloNet]] connections there and show him images of forests, rivers, and oceans.<ref name="TPtSatFB" />

By the age of three Luke had found pleasure playing with a model spaceship built especially for him. Luke did not know that Kenobi had actually built it and that Kenobi had been leaving several of them at his grandmother [[Shmi Skywalker Lars|Shmi's]] sandblasted tombstone for his aunt to find. One morning, as Luke played with his toy, a group of marauders attacked the farm. Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had been watching Luke from afar, sprang into action, cutting down several Gamorreans before coming to the realization that he was badly outnumbered. Just as he was about to be dealt a possibly killing blow by one of the gang, Luke threw the toy starfighter he had been playing with, managing to distract the Gammorean long enough for Kenobi to separate his feet from his ankles. The battle then raged further, slowly turning in the favor of the defenders which included uncle Owen, who managed to gun down several of the invaders with a blaster. Luke cried out after noticing that one of the marauders, a [[Devaronian]], had snuck up behind Owen, ready to knock him out. Kenobi then threw his lightsaber cutting the last marauder in half. As Luke cheered, Owen threw a punch which knocked Kenobi to the ground. Owen then ushered Luke back before chastising Kenobi for his involvement, pointing out the fact that Luke's brief show of bravery had potential ramifications for the boy's future. <ref name="Time of Death">{{Shortstory|story=Time of Death|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>

====Taking on Jabba's thugs====
{{Quote|That right kid? you were trying to steal Jabba's water?"''<br />"''It's not Jabba's. It belongs to the ''farmers'', I was taking it back.|One of Jabba's Thugs and Luke Skywalker|Star Wars 7: From the Journals of Old Ben Kenobi: The Last of His Breed}}
[[File:Ben Kenobi saves young Luke.png|thumb|right|300px|Unknown to Skywalker, he was protected by his father's former friend, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.]]
At the age of eight, during the [[Great Drought]] in [[11 BBY]],<ref name="GA" /> henchmen for the [[crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the [[Hutt]] collected a "[[water tax]]" on their master's behalf. Despite the damage it caused [[moisture farmer]]s, Skywalker naïvely stood up to the thugs at night, trying to take back the [[water]] they had stolen from the [[farmer]]s. Kenobi, who sensed the danger his protégé was in, blew their vehicle's lights with [[the Force]] to hide his identity, and proceeded to disable all of Jabba's henchmen. One of them became startled and pushed Skywalker to the ground, causing him to hit his head and pass out. Once Kenobi handled the thugs, he carried Skywalker to the Lars' homestead where he was found asleep, unaware of his savior's identity, by his aunt in the morning.<ref name="SW7">''[[Star Wars 7: From the Journals of Old Ben Kenobi: The Last of His Breed]]''</ref>

====Saving Uncle Owen====
{{Quote|Hang on, Uncle Owen!|Luke Skywalker after rescuing his uncle.|Star Wars 20: From the Journals of Old Ben Kenobi}}
Some time after grounding Luke from flying his skyhopper, Owen Lars attempted to rebuild his relationship with his nephew by looking to help him fix it. However, before he could, he was captured by the Wookiee bounty hunter [[Black Krrsantan]] and tortured. Meanwhile, Luke was running away from home for not the first time. However, he sensed something was wrong and rushed to his homestead. When he arrived, he found many droids destroyed and his aunt Beru rattled, telling him of the attack. She ordered her nephew to lock himself in the homestead's maintenance bay, where he found his disabled skyhopper. He proceeded to fix it and make his way to Krrsantan and Owen. As he flew there, the Wookiee was engaged by Obi-Wan Kenobi. During this battle, Owen was thrown off a cliff. Before he could hit the bottom, Luke, in his skyhopper, managed to catch him and escape. Meanwhile, Kenobi defeated Krrsantan. Afterwards, Skywalker was allowed to fly his skyhopper once again.<ref name="SW20">''[[Star Wars 20: From the Journals of Old Ben Kenobi]]''</ref>

====Other adventures====
{{Quote|Tell me...is it the Chosen One?''"<br />"''He is.''"<br />"''He will avenge us.|Maul and Obi-Wan Kenobi's final conversation, referencing Luke Skywalker|Twin Suns (episode)|Twin Suns}}
[[File:Twin-suns-10_46371077.jpeg|thumb|left|300px|As the years passed, Kenobi continued to watch over his friend's son from afar.]]
Eventually, Skywalker became an adventure-seeking youth who demonstrated his father's natural [[pilot]]ing skills, as well as a strong desire to leave Tatooine. As more of Skywalker's friends left the planet to follow their dreams, he became increasingly frustrated that his uncle would not allow him to do the same, claiming that he still needed help with the [[Moisture farm|farm]]. In truth, Owen was trying to prevent Skywalker from following in his father's footsteps.<ref name="Episode IV" />

In [[2 BBY]], Skywalker was helping at his foster parent's moisture farm when Beru called him inside. As Skywalker ran back to the house, he was watched in the distance by Obi-Wan Kenobi, who was riding a [[dewback]]. Kenobi had just [[Mission to Tatooine (Imperial Era)|defeated and killed]] the former [[Sith apprentice]] [[Maul]], who had a vendetta against Kenobi after being bisected at the torso during the [[Invasion of Naboo]] [[32 BBY|thirty years earlier]]. In his final moments, Maul asked Kenobi if he was guarding Skywalker. Kenobi affirmed that he believed Luke was the [[Chosen One]] before Maul passed away.<ref name="Twin Suns">{{Rebels|Twin Suns (episode)|Twin Suns}}</ref>

When not helping his uncle, Skywalker would occasionally go bulls-eye [[Womp rat]]s, or go racing through the dangerous [[Beggar's Canyon]] in his [[T-16 skyhopper|T-16 Skyhopper]] by the age of thirteen.<ref name="TPtSatFB" /> He would also spend time at [[Tosche Station]] with his friends, such as [[Biggs Darklighter]],<ref name="Episode IV" /> [[Laze Loneozner|Laze "Fixer" Loneozner]], [[Camie Marstrap]],<ref name="SWCT">''[[Star Wars: Card Trader]]''</ref> [[Windy]], and [[Deak (Skywalker's friend)|Deak]];<ref name="TPtSatFB" /> some of them called him "Wormie".<ref name="SW5">''[[Star Wars 5: Skywalker Strikes, Part V]]''</ref>

===Galactic Civil War===

I have no doubt this boy is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.''"<br />"''How is that possible?''"<br />"''Search your feelings, Lord Vader. You will know it to be true.

Obi-Wan can no longer help him.|Sheev Palpatine and Darth Vader confer about Luke Skywalker|audio=GreatDisturbanceInTheForce.ogg|Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}
====Leaving Tatooine====
{{Quote|I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.|Luke Skywalker to Obi-Wan Kenobi|audio=Luke-IWantToComeWithYouToAlderaan.ogg|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}
[[File:Lukesaberanh.png|thumb|right|300px|Skywalker learned through Kenobi that his father was once a Jedi Knight of the Galactic Republic.]]
In [[0 BBY]], the purchase of two [[droid]]s—[[R2-D2]] and [[C-3PO]]—by Skywalker's step-uncle changed the young farm boy's life forever. Obtaining the droids from a band of [[Jawa]]s to help with various tasks around the homestead, neither of them were aware that the droids had narrowly escaped from the Galactic Empire, and that R2-D2 contained a set of [[Death Star plans|plans]] for the Empire's dreaded [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]] [[superweapon]].

While cleaning the two new droids back at the homestead, Skywalker learned that they had been involved with the Rebel Alliance, and witnessed part of a desperate message from [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Organa]] requesting help from someone named "Obi-Wan Kenobi", whom R2-D2 claimed that he once belonged to. Skywalker soon found himself in the company of Kenobi after being attacked by a group of [[Tusken Raider|Sand People]] out in the [[Jundland Wastes]]. Kenobi soon revealed to Skywalker that he had once been a [[Jedi]] Knight who served in the Clone Wars with Skywalker's father. He went on to inform Skywalker that his father was not a spice freighter navigator like his uncle had always told him, but a Jedi Knight struck down by Darth Vader, and gave him his father's [[Skywalker's lightsaber|lightsaber]].<ref name="Episode IV" /> After he showed Princess Leia's message in its entirety to Kenobi, the old Jedi Master requested Skywalker's help to see the mission through, and offered to show him the ways of the Force. Skywalker initially refused to get involved, as he believed his duties at home were more important, but he offered to take Kenobi to Anchorhead.

On their way to Anchorhead, Skywalker and Kenobi came upon a group of slaughtered Jawas—the same ones who sold the droids to his uncle. Skywalker deduced from learning that Imperial [[stormtrooper]]s were responsible that they might have looked into the sales records of the droids, and rushed home in the hopes of saving his step-aunt and step-uncle. Upon returning home, Skywalker discovered that he was too late: his step-aunt and step-uncle had been murdered by the Empire. With the people who raised him dead, he decided to accompany Kenobi to [[Alderaan]] to deliver the plans back to the Alliance and learn the ways of the Jedi.<ref name="Episode IV" />

On their way to Mos Eisley, Kenobi began [[Jedi training|training]] him and gave Skywalker his first lesson, during which he learned the basics of [[Meditation|Jedi meditation]].<ref name="weapon-jedi">''[[The Weapon of a Jedi: A Luke Skywalker Adventure]]''</ref> They would later reach [[Chalmun's Cantina]], where Kenobi claimed that they could find a pilot that could get them to Alderaan. Inside the cantina, Skywalker nearly had a fatal run-in with the criminals [[Ponda Baba]] and [[Cornelius Evazan|Dr. Evazan]], but trouble was avoided when Kenobi sliced off Baba's arm with his [[Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber (Jedi Master)|lightsaber]] in defense of Skywalker.

The two were eventually able to find a pilot that could take them to Alderaan in the form of [[Han Solo]], a [[Corellian]] [[smuggler]], and his co-pilot [[Chewbacca]]. Solo's initial rate was ten thousand [[credit]]s all paid in advance, which Skywalker thought was too expensive. Ultimately, they were able to compromise when Kenobi offered to pay two thousand credits up front and an additional fifteen thousand when they got to Alderaan, for a total of seventeen thousand credits, which convinced Solo to take them, with Skywalker selling his [[Landspeeder|speeder]] to pay for the two thousand up front.<ref name="Episode IV" />

====Death Star rescue====
{{Quote|I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you.''"<br />"''You're who?''"<br />"''I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2-Unit. I am here with Ben Kenobi.''"<br />"''Ben Kenobi?! Where is he?!''"<br />"''Come on!|Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}
[[File:LukeLeiaDS1.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Skywalker rescued Princess Leia Organa, completely unaware that she was his twin sister.]]
After escaping stormtroopers on Solo's ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', Kenobi began Skywalker's instruction in the ways of the Force, using a [[Marksman-H training remote|training remote]] to instruct him in basic [[lightsaber combat]], much to the derision of Solo, who dismissed it as a "hokey religion".<ref name="Episode IV" /><ref name="weapon-jedi" /> Wearing a [[helmet]] that completely covered his [[eye]]s for part of the lesson, Kenobi encouraged him to reach out with the Force to combat the remote. Despite his vision being totally impaired, Skywalker was able to successfully deflect a pair of [[Laser|blaster bolts]] from the remote, claiming that he could "almost see" the remote through the Force.

The lesson, however, was soon interrupted by their arrival in the [[Alderaan system]] and their discovery of the planet's [[The Disaster|destruction]]. They then spotted a patrolling [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighter]] and, upon following it, found that it was approaching what appeared to be a small moon, which turned out to be the [[Death Star]]. Caught by the Death Star's [[tractor beam]], they were brought aboard the massive [[space station]].<ref name="Episode IV" />

Once on board, Luke and Han knocked two stormtroopers out and stole their armor, whereas Kenobi set out to deactivate the tractor beam. However, when R2-D2 discovered that Leia Organa was being held captive on the station, Skywalker insisted on [[Rescue of Princess Leia|rescuing]] her. Though Solo was reluctant to go marching into the [[Detention Level|detention block]], Skywalker convinced him to go along with the rescue by claiming that he'd get a significant reward for doing so.

Still using their stormtrooper guises, Skywalker and Solo convinced Chewbacca to pose as a prisoner and escorted him to [[Detention Block AA-23]] (where Organa was being held.) They were able to rescue Organa, but their cover was blown and they had to jump into the [[garbage compactor]] in order to escape the pursuing Imperial forces. Though Skywalker and Organa were separated from Solo and Chewbacca, they were able to reunite with their companions, and the droids, in the hangar bay.<ref name="Episode IV" />

Eventually, the group escaped the Death Star, but only after Kenobi sacrificed himself in a duel with Darth Vader.<ref name="Episode IV" /> Angry and confused, Organa offered some comfort for his grief.<ref name="TPtSatFB" /> Despite the fact that they had escaped from the Death Star, a pursing TIE fighter patrol was on the verge of catching up to them, so at Solo's request, Skywalker manned one of the ''Millennium Falcon'''s [[quad laser cannon]]s to eliminate the enemy fighters, with Skywalker managing to destroy two of them. Once the patrol was eliminated, they traveled to the hidden [[Great Temple (Yavin 4)|rebel base]] on [[Yavin 4]], under the suspicion that the Death Star was tracking them.<ref name="Episode IV" />

====Yavin 4====
{{Quote|Great shot, kid; that was one in a million!|Han Solo to Luke Skywalker after the destruction of the Death Star|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}
[[File:Red5.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Skywalker fought for the Rebel Alliance as an X-wing starfighter pilot during the Battle of Yavin.]]
On their arrival, they met with [[Commander]] [[Vanden Willard|Willard]],<ref name="Episode IV" /> and Organa introduce him to Skywalker so that he could join the Rebel Alliance as a [[Rebel pilot|pilot]]. Skywalker then separated and met [[Wedge Antilles]], who oversaw his flight simulation test. Lasting no more than 30 [[second]]s, the more experienced pilot advised Skywalker to listen to his explanations, and encouraged him not to give up. In his second try, Skywalker used what he had learned from Antilles, and managed to surpass the highest score, that of Antilles's, prompting Willard to accept him without objection.<ref name="TPtSatFB" /> He joined [[Red Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Red Group]] with the designation of [[Red Five]],<ref name="Episode IV" /> which had previously belonged to a [[cadet]] named [[Pedrin Gaul]], who had perished during the [[Battle of Scarif]] several days earlier.<ref name="Rogue One">''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''</ref>

After the briefing for their plan of attack against the incoming Death Star, Skywalker prepared himself for the attack, when he saw Solo loading his payment onto the ''Falcon'' for rescuing Organa and prepared to leave the group. Skywalker attempted to persuade him to stay and help them against the Empire, but Solo refused, claiming that the attack on the Death Star was suicide rather than bravery, deeply disappointing him. After bidding farewell to Organa as well,<ref name="Episode IV" /> Skywalker was about to board [[Red Five (X-wing starfighter)|his]] [[T-65B X-wing starfighter]], when he encountered his old friend Biggs Darklighter, the two about to be flying as wingmen in the upcoming battle. In a brief conversation, Darklighter promised Luke that the two would catch up on each other's stories when they got back.<ref name="Episode IV" /> Skywalker was also approached by [[Garven Dreis]], the [[commander]] of Red Squadron, who asked him if he was sure he could handle the X-wing, to which Darklighter vouched for his friend, calling him the "best bush pilot in the Outer Rim Territories."

As the [[Battle of Yavin]] got underway and Skywalker and his fellow squadmates launched into space, Skywalker was guided by the [[Force spirit|spirit]] of Obi-Wan Kenobi. He participated in Red Squadron's initial assault on the Death Star's outer defenses, primarily focusing on disabling the station's numerous [[XX-9 heavy turbolaser battery|turbolaser batteries]] and fighting off TIE fighters when they were deployed against the Rebel fighters. He also helped to provide cover for [[Gold Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Gold Squadron]] when they made the first attack run on the [[meridian trench]], as well as Commander Dreis when he made his attack run. Eventually, Darth Vader himself joined the fray in a [[TIE Advanced x1]] and succeeded in thwarting the first two attack runs. Just before he was shot down by the Sith Lord, Commander Dreis instructed Skywalker to lead a third and final run on the trench with Darklighter and Antilles.

Skywalker took charge of the last attempt on the [[thermal exhaust port]] as instructed, but Vader and his two escort fighters soon caught up to them. Antilles was forced to withdraw after his starfighter suffered damage, and Darklighter was eventually shot down as well. Unable to grieve for his fallen friend, Skywalker tried to focus on his target. He was once again contacted by the spirit to Kenobi, who urged him to let the Force guide him. This prompted Skywalker to disable his starfighter's [[targeting computer]], much to the confusion of the Rebel leaders continuing to monitor the battle from the surface of Yavin 4.

Just as Skywalker reached the end of the trench, it appeared as though Vader would shoot him down like he had the other pilots, but before he could, Han Solo and Chewbacca showed up in the ''Millennium Falcon'', destroying Vader's two escorts and causing Vader's TIE Advanced to spiral out of control away from the trench. At Solo's urging, Skywalker took a single shot and fired two [[proton torpedo]]s, using the Force to guide them to their target, which resulted in the destruction of the Death Star. For this action he, Chewbacca, and Han Solo were awarded the [[medal of Bravery]] the morning after.<ref name="Episode IV" />

[[File:Luke watches Leia escape.png|thumb|left|300px|After destroying the Death Star, Skywalker became a fully committed soldier in the Rebellion.]]
Just as the [[Royal Award Ceremony|ceremony]] ended, Skywalker told Organa to allow herself some time to grieve for the loss of her family and homeworld. Afterwards, [[General]] [[Jan Dodonna]] sent him and Antilles, the only other survivor of Red Group, in their X-wings to retrieve the wayward princess and bring her to the Great Temple. [[Jan Dodonna's T-1 shuttle|Her]] [[T-1 shuttle|shuttle's]] pilot, [[Evaan Verlaine]], however, managed to outsmart them and make the jump to [[hyperspace]] with course to [[Naboo]], with R2-D2 accompanying the two women.<ref name="PL1">''[[Princess Leia, Part I]]''</ref> They would later reunite after she had successfully accomplished her [[Mission to rescue the survivors of Alderaan|mission]].<ref name="PL5">''[[Princess Leia, Part V]]''</ref> Soon after, Skywalker became an [[Rebel officer|officer]] in the Alliance and was given the [[Military rank|rank]] of [[Lieutenant]] and was regularly assigned numerous independent missions.<ref name="HttJ">''[[Heir to the Jedi]]''</ref>

====The ''Desert Jewel''====
{{Quote|Ever since the Battle of Yavin, I feel sometimes that people expect me to top it and wonder why I haven't yet.|Luke Skywalker|Heir to the Jedi}}
[[File:Luke defends Drusil.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Skywalker defending Drusil Bephorin on Denon.]]
In an errand for Admiral Ackbar, Skywalker was dispatched to the planet [[Rodia]] in order to open a secret weapon supply line for the Alliance. He was accompanied by Artoo and a pilot named [[Nakari Kelen]], and they flew her ship, the ''[[Desert Jewel]]''. During their mission together, they [[Skirmish over Llanic|helped]] a [[Kupohan]] ship&mdash;which, unknown to them at the time, carried vital intelligence on a [[Givin]] cryptographer named [[Drusil Bephorin]]&mdash;near [[Llanic]]. They then continued their journey to Rodia. Skywalker was greeted by [[Laneet Chekkoo]], who guided him to [[Toopil]]. During business with [[Taneetch Soonta]], the [[Rodian]] told Skywalker about the Jedi, including a story about Anakin during the Clone Wars. From her, Skywalker received [[Huulik|her uncle's]] [[Huulik's lightsaber|lightsaber]].<ref name="HttJ" />

[[File:Brazilian Heir to the Jedi cover.png|thumb|left|200px|Skywalker and Nakari on Fex.]]
After killing a [[ghest]] and getting some treatment for his wounds, Skywalker focused on analyzing Huulik's lightsaber and trying to learn [[telekinesis]], but a planetwide alert for the ''Desert Jewel'' forced him to leave Rodia immediately and meet up with Ackbar and Organa on the ''[[Promise]]''. The two assigned him to a [[Mission on Denon|mission]] to rescue Bephorin on [[Denon]], but the need for upgrades for the ''Jewel'' prompted him to go on another [[Mission to Fex|mission]] to [[Fex]] with Kelen before that. Warned by Organa not to blindly trust Kelen, Skywalker set off for [[Pasher]] with Kelen and Artoo to receive intel from [[Fayet Kelen|her father]] about their destination and the necessary equipment to survive its atmosphere. The two then headed towards Fex. Once they successfully retrieved the ''[[Harvester (XS-800)|Harvester]]'' and were rewarded for it, Skywalker and Kelen traveled to Rodia to fix the ''Desert Jewel''.<ref name="HttJ" />

Following the ship's modifications, the two Rebels returned to the ''Promise'' to receive more intel on the Denon mission from Organa and Ackbar, only to depart for the planet as soon as possible, meet with their contact [[Sakhet]], and prepare Bephorin's liberation. Once in motion, their plan allowed them to escape from [[Imperial Security Bureau]] [[agent]]s, and Denon altogether, with the Givin cryptographer onboard the ''Jewel''. Despite several hiccups along the way, including an extended stop on [[Kupoh]], they reached [[Omereth]]. There, however, the ''Jewel'' was intercepted by [[bounty hunter]]s and a confrontation ensued between the Rebels and their pursuers. Despite the formers' victory, Kelen was killed by one of the bounty hunters&mdash;saddening Skywalker, who had come to develop feelings for her. After allowing himself some time to grieve for those he had lost during the war, Skywalker completed his mission by reuniting Bephorin with her family and meeting with [[Major]] [[Bren Derlin]]. Afterwards, Skywalker returned Kelen's body to her father, after reflecting on the fact that he had learned how to move objects with the Force thanks to her support.<ref name="HttJ" />

====Devaron====
{{Quote|Hyperspace scout. Historian. Farm boy. And yet here you are with a Jedi laser sword in your hand, like you mean to use it.|Sarco Plank|The Weapon of a Jedi: A Luke Skywalker Adventure}}
After numerous missions alongside Antilles and earning each other's complete trust, Skywalker assisted on a [[Mission to Giju|mission]] for Red Squadron above [[Giju]]: he helped protect a transport carrying underground rebel leaders being evacuated from the planet, along with Antilles and Commander [[Arhul Narra]]. Once the package was clear, they followed the scatter protocol, and Skywalker and R2-D2 set course to [[Devaron]] when he had a vision about future events on that same planet. He soon met with Antilles and Narra, who sent him, C-3PO and R2-D2 on a [[Mission to recover Imperial communication logs|mission]] for [[Chancellor (Rebel Alliance)|Chancellor]] [[Mon Mothma]].<ref name="weapon-jedi" />

[[File:Luke_vs_Training_remotes.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Luke Skywalker trains at the site of the former Jedi Temple of Eedit on Devaron.]]
After refueling the ship, the trio departed for [[Whiforla II]] and jumped out of hyperspace in the [[Tertiary Usaita system]], but an Imperial attack forced them to return to Devaron and repair the [[Y 4]], this time letting the Force guide him into the [[Temple of Eedit]]. Landing in [[Tikaroo]], Skywalker left the ship for repairs with [[Kivas]] and his daughter, [[Farnay]], using the alias "[[Korl Marcus]]", and went onto the depot where he was told the Temple was off-limits; after resting and a vision of the past, he left the depot and met with Farnay, to whom he revealed his true identity. Ultimately, [[Sarco Plank]] accepted to be his guide and brought Skywalker and the two droids close to Eedit, where Skywalker found a secret entrance to the Temple and entered alone with the droids.<ref name="weapon-jedi" />

During his stay on the Temple, Skywalker heard Kenobi's voice, from whom he received further instructions. He managed to enter a secret chamber where he and the droids found three [[Marksman-H training remote|training remotes]]. Using what Kenobi had taught him on the ''Falcon'', Skywalker gradually managed to pass the exercises after a few days, only to find himself surrounded by Imperials with orders to apprehend him and his fugitive [[starfighter]], using Farnay as a hostage. However, Plank unexpectedly appeared and helped Skywalker [[Skirmish in the Temple of Eedit|fight]] the stormtroopers with his [[electrostaff]], and observed that Skywalker was merely a [[Padawan]].<ref name="weapon-jedi" />

[[File:Luke_and_Sarco_Plank_in_Eedit.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Skywalker and Sarco Plank engage Imperial forces in the Temple of Eedit.]]
Planning to ransack the Temple to pay his debts, Plank then challenged him to a duel, during which he used a [[grenade]] to blind him, seeing that Skywalker would not be defeated so easily. Prepared to administer the coup de grace, Farnay interrupted him, for which Plank put [[binder]]s on her; however, it gave Skywalker time to stand up and slash Plank's control box, casting him and his electrostaff into a pit leading to the temple's underlevels. Skywalker then passed out and Farnay tended his wounds, to whom he swore he would become a Jedi and rebuild the [[Jedi Order|Order]], and return to Eedit one day. With the droids, they left the Temple as Imperial reinforcements arrived afterwards.<ref name="weapon-jedi" />

Back in Tikaroo, Skywalker reclaimed his now-repaired starfighter from Kivas, and before departing Devaron, he dropped several bombs at the base of the spire to cut off the paths into the jungle, meaning to stop the [[pikhron]] hunt.<ref name="weapon-jedi" />

Years later, after defeating the Emperor, Skywalker kept his promise to Farnay and returned to Devaron. He was accompanied by C-3PO for the trip.<ref name="weapon-jedi" />

====Cymoon 1====
{{Quote|You, boy, are ''no'' Jedi. Who are you?''"<br />"''You killed my father!''"<br />"''I've killed very many fathers. You'll have to be more specific.|Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker during a brief duel in Cymoon 1|Star Wars 2: Skywalker Strikes, Part II}}
Alongside Organa, Solo, Chewbacca, R2-D2, and C-3PO, Skywalker took part of a [[Attack on Cymoon 1|mission]] to infiltrate [[Cymoon 1]]. To do so, the rebel team hijacked the ship of an emissary sent by Jabba the Hutt to negotiate a weapons deal at [[Weapons Factory Alpha]], with Solo as its replacement and Organa and Skywalker disguised as his bodyguards.<ref name="Star Wars 1" />

[[File:Luke frees the slaves.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Luke Skywalker frees a group of captive Imperial slaves held on the grounds of Weapons Factory Alpha on Cymoon 1.]]
Once inside the facility, they revealed themselves as rebels to [[Overseer]] [[Aggadeen]], took their escorts down and made their way to the central power station. While Organa, Solo, and R2-D2 rigged the place to destroy it, Skywalker watched for additional Imperial troops, using what little he knew of the Force to reach out and sense any nearby presence. However, he was drawn to caged [[Slavery|slaves]], whom he proceeded to free, and guided them to a rendezvous with Solo and Organa, when they were alerted of Vader's arrival by Chewbacca.<ref name="Star Wars 1" />

Determined to fight Vader for killing his father and Kenobi, he heard his mentor's voice speak to him from beyond, telling him to run, just as he faced the [[Dark Lord of the Sith|Dark Lord]].<ref name="Star Wars 1" /> However, he was no match for Vader, who quickly seized Skywalker's lightsaber and was about to kill him, until he realized that Skywalker's lightsaber had been once his own. Solo then intervened with an [[All Terrain Armored Transport|AT-AT]], crashing the [[walker]] through the factory's walls, giving Skywalker and the slaves an opening to escape from the facility.<ref name="SW2">''[[Star Wars 2: Skywalker Strikes, Part II]]''</ref>

[[File:Vader bests luke.PNG|thumb|left|200px|Luke Skywalker is dispatched by Darth Vader following a brief confrontation on Cymoon 1.]]
Seeing so many of the freed slaves die by Imperial fire, Skywalker regretted his decision, but continued fighting after stealing a [[speeder bike]]. After the Rebels' walker opened fire against Vader,<ref name="SW2" /> Skywalker picked his lightsaber up from the rubble, rushed to assist his team—whose walker had fallen down due to Vader—, and provided some cover fire. Determined to destroy the factory, Skywalker disobeyed Organa's orders and used his stolen speeder bike to destroy the power core despite Vader's threat. Afterwards, he managed to board the ''Millennium Falcon'', reunite with his team and escape Cymoon 1, yet with his morale at rock bottom.<ref name="SW3">''[[Star Wars 3: Skywalker Strikes, Part III]]''</ref>

====Return to Tatooine====
{{Quote|"There's nothing here for me now." That's what I said when I left this place. Let's hope I was ''wrong''.|Luke Skywalker|Star Wars 5: Skywalker Strikes, Part V}}
Once they returned to the [[Alliance Fleet]], Skywalker continued working on his lightsaber techniques until Organa came to see him. Skywalker told her that he lacked interest in undertaking any more missions, as he did not consider himself a Jedi but a danger, and that until he could figure out who he was, he could not be around the Alliance; he asked Organa to let him go. Much to her and Solo's dismay, Skywalker (along with R2-D2) took off in an X-wing and set off on a course for Tatooine. Hoping to find some guidance in [[Ben Kenobi's home|Kenobi's hut]], Skywalker and R2 made their way across the [[desert]] to the abandoned residence, where they found it being pillaged by Tusken raiders, who fled in fear upon seeing his activated lightsaber.<ref name="SW4">''[[Star Wars 4: Skywalker Strikes, Part IV]]''</ref>

[[File:Boba_Fett_vs_Luke_Skywalker.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Skywalker duels Boba Fett after being ambushed in Obi-Wan Kenobi's former home on Tatooine.]]
Inside the hut, Skywalker had R2 scan the ransacked place for anything of value, and the small android came across a box addressed to Skywalker. However, before they could find out its contents, one of [[Boba Fett]]'s [[flash grenade]]s incapacitated R2-D2 and blinded Skywalker.<ref name="SW5" /> Fett proceeded to aim a [[Blaster rifle|rifle]] to his head, but Skywalker [[Duel in Ben Kenobi's home|fought back]] with his lightsaber despite his temporary blindness. Despite his disadvantage and multiple wounds done by Fett, Skywalker managed to [[Form V|deflect]] the bounty hunter's shot at point-blank and Fett tackled him in anger.<ref name="SW6">''[[Star Wars 6: Skywalker Strikes, Part VI]]''</ref>

Close to death by his own lightsaber as he struggled against Fett, R2-D2 saved him by hurling Kenobi's box and knocking the hunter out. Still blinded and carrying the box, Skywalker had R2-D2 lead him to his X-Wing.<ref name="SW6" /> On his way to an unknown location, he read some of Kenobi's passages on his [[The Journals of Ben Kenobi|journals]], including one set during the Great Drought involving him.<ref name="SW7" />

====Showdown on Nar Shaddaa====
{{Quote|You want to finally be a Jedi Knight, kid? Here's your chance. Go die like one.|Kreel to Luke Skywalker|Star Wars 11: Showdown on the Smuggler's Moon, Part IV}}
Though Kenobi's journals contained a number of stories, Skywalker became frustrated as he continued to read them as he did not understand what lessons were to be learned about using a lightsaber or wielding the Force. Though Artoo suggested returning to the fleet, Skywalker had no intention of returning until he found the answers he was seeking. Artoo's suggestion did, however, give the young Jedi an idea: to venture into the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]] on [[Coruscant]], the former home of the Jedi Order. Before he could travel to Coruscant, however, Skywalker set a course to [[Nar Shaddaa]], a world of pirates and outlaws known as the "Smuggler's Moon." Upon landing, Skywalker set off looking for someone who could help him get to the [[Jedi temple|Jedi Temple]]. He entered a cantina, where he was immediately attacked by criminals looking to rob and kill him. Skywalker brandished his lightsaber and demanded that they cease their attack, while the bartender asked where he acquired a Jedi's lightsaber. He did not answer, instead saying that he was simply on Nar Shaddaa to conduct business and had already stated his purpose for entering the establishment. The bartender guessed that Skywalker was seeking entry into the Jedi Temple, meaning he would need to hire someone who could sneak him onto the capital world of the Empire. The bartender told him that he could do that for the boy, but the price would be the lightsaber&mdash;a price that Skywalker rejected, so the bartender resorted to his previous plan of killing and robbing the boy.<ref name="SW8">''[[Star Wars 8: Showdown on the Smuggler's Moon, Part I]]''</ref>

[[File:Luke Skywalker and the thief fall.png|thumb|left|300px|Skywalker and the thief fall towards the streets of Hutta Town, as the young Jedi reaches for his weapon.]]
Before the others could kill him, however, a [[Unidentified lightsaber thief (Nar Shaddaa)|thief]] stole the lightsaber and fled the bar. Skywalker gave chase,<ref name="SW8" /> pursuing the [[thief]] through the streets and over rooftops. The thief jumped onto a ship that was passing by and hung onto the bottom of it, and Skywalker used the Force to make the now-even longer jump towards them and grab the thief's leg. The thief lost his holding and both men fell towards the streets of [[Hutta Town]] below, where Skywalker retrieved his lightsaber once both he and the thief landed. The young Jedi was then confronted by [[Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi|Grakkus]] the Hutt, a Nar Shaddaa crime lord who employed the thief that stole the lightsaber. Skywalker fought the Hutt's [[IG-100 MagnaGuard|MagnaGuard]], while at the same time overhearing the thief telling Grakkus that Skywalker said his father was a Jedi and that he was seeking access to the Jedi Temple. Having his own plans for the boy, Grakkus knocked Skywalker out with a punch to the face.<ref name="SW9">''[[Star Wars 9: Showdown on the Smuggler's Moon, Part II]]''</ref>

Skywalker later awoke to find himself in Grakkus' [[Palace of Grakkus the Hutt|palace]], which contained untold numbers of relics from the Jedi Order. Grakkus held out a Jedi [[holocron]], though Skywalker did not know what it was. Grakkus, who explained that he was a collector of Jedi artifacts in addition to being a crime lord, told him that the item was a holocron and that only an individual who was strong with the Force could open it. Though Skywalker had no experience with holocrons, the Hutt gave him five seconds to open the holocron or be killed. Under threat of death, the boy reached out with the Force and was able to open the holocron, as well as the many others that were in the collection. They revealed themselves as containing historical records about the Jedi and the Sith, including the revelation that there was a [[Jedi Temple (Vrogas Vas)|Jedi Temple]] on [[Vrogas Vas]]. With Skywalker having proved himself, Grakkus believed he would make a fine addition to his collection as the last living Jedi.<ref name="SW9" /> Grakkus planned to put Skywalker into an arena fight that he would bill as the death of the last Jedi, so the Hutt ordered him taken to the arena's gamemaster to be prepared. Artoo, knowing that Skywalker had been captured, send a distress call to the Alliance Fleet, where it was intercepted by the High Command. Though Chancellor Mothma was unwilling to send a team of Rebels on a suicide mission despite Skywalker's importance to the Rebellion, Chewbacca and Threepio&mdash;who remained with the fleet while Solo and Organa were on their own mission&mdash;volunteered to rescue their captured friend.<ref name="SW9" />

[[File:Luke Skywalker vs the gamemaster.png|thumb|right|300px|Grakkus the Hutt's "Gamemaster" Kreel bests Skywalker in a training duel on Nar Shaddaa.]]
The gamemaster&mdash;secretly an Imperial stormtrooper named [[Sergeant]] [[Kreel]]<ref name="SW12">''[[Star Wars 12: Showdown on the Smuggler's Moon, Part V]]''</ref>&mdash;introduced himself to Skywalker once the Jedi was led to the arena, and he stated that it was his job to make sure Skywalker was prepared to put on a good show before ultimately dying in the arena. Though Skywalker initially refused to fight, Kreel knew he would ultimately do so because he wanted to learn to hone his skills as a Jedi. The Kreel also told him that the Jedi Temple no longer existed, as it had been converted into the Imperial Palace&mdash;so whatever Skywalker was hoping to find was gone, as were the other Jedi temples in the galaxy. He then threw the lightsaber to Skywalker and removed the binds that the boy's hands were in. While surrounded by MagnaGuards, the Kreel used a lightsaber of his own and engaged in a duel to begin preparing him for the arena match. Though the Kreel was not a Jedi, he was a more-skilled swordsman and quickly bested Skywalker. Skywalker then engaged multiple MagnaGuards in combat.<ref name="SW10">''[[Star Wars 10: Showdown on the Smuggler's Moon, Part III]]''</ref>

The big event soon arrived, and crime lords and other criminal types flocked to watch the death of the last Jedi. Skywalker spoke to Grakkus, who reminded him that no one wanted to watch him win and that everyone had paid to see him die, though the young Jedi believed he could succeed nonetheless. Grakkus also revealed that scavengers had found Skywalker's X-wing and the Journal of Ben Kenobi, which Grakkus intended to add to his collection. The event began once Grakkus left, and Skywalker entered into the arena and was introduced as the last of the Jedi. The announcer claimed that he was a veteran of battles across the galaxy and that he had fought Hutts and bounty hunters alike, hyping up the untrained Jedi hopeful. The announcer then introduced the Jedi's opponent: [[Kongo|Kongo the Disemboweler]], a large and fearsome creature from the [[dolovite]] [[Mining|mines]] of [[Mustafar]]. Skywalker ignited the green-bladed lightsaber that was given to him for the show and the fight began. The young Jedi slashed his blade at the creature, but the opponent's armor was resistant to a lightsaber blade and made it difficult for Skywalker to combat the creature. He remained confident, however, reminding himself that he blew up the Death Star, fought Boba Fett, and was trained by Obi-Wan Kenobi. He closed his eyes in an attempt to use the Force as his ally, but Kongo used the opportunity to throw Skywalker across the arena and knocking him onto the ground.<ref name="SW11">''[[Star Wars 11: Showdown on the Smuggler's Moon, Part IV]]''</ref>

[[File:Luke fights in the arena.png|thumb|left|300px|Skywalker battles Imperial soldiers in Grakkus' arena.]]
The beast grabbed Skywalker as the audience cheered for Kongo to make the kill, and Skywalker tried calling out to Kenobi to ask for miracle. Just as he did so, the beast's [[shock collar]] was activated by Kreel, who revealed himself to Grakkus as an Imperial and announced he was taking Skywalker into custody. Stormtroopers [[Rescue of Luke Skywalker|poured]] into the arena and surrounded Skywalker, arresting both him and the Hutt. Grakkus had one trick up his sleeve, though, and triggered an electromagnetic pulse that disabled the Imperials' blasters. Grakkus, skilled at combat in his own right, began fighting the weaponless stormtroopers, while other troops grabbed Skywalker. Just then, the young Jedi saw that Artoo, who had infiltrated the palace, recovered his lightsaber and threw it into the arena, so Skywalker grabbed it and cut the soldiers down. Kongo chased the spectators out of the arena, and Skywalker while Kreel confronted Skywalker, knocking him to the ground and revealing his true identity as a stormtrooper of the [[501st Legion]] tasked with arresting him. Skywalker was saved by the timely arrival of Grakkus, who Kreel attacked as Skywalker got away.<ref name="SW12" />

Skywalker regrouped with Solo, Organa, Chewbacca, and the droids, all of whom ultimately traveled to Nar Shaddaa to rescue their captive friend. Solo, Organa, and Chewbacca each wielded lightsabers that Artoo stole from the palace so they were not defenseless in the wake of the EMP blast, leading Skywalker to quip that Solo looked good with a lightsaber. Artoo recovered Kenobi's journal and Skywalker wanted to go back to the palace to recover more artifacts, but the arena was flooded with blaster-wielding stormtroopers so Chewbacca grabbed the resistant Skywalker and brought him out of the arena. The Rebels returned to the ''Millennium Falcon'' and escaped from Nar Shaddaa.<ref name="SW12" />

====Vrogas Vas====
{{Quote|...right now I'm just a Rebel pilot who needs to help his friends. Learning to be a Jedi will have to wait.|Skywalker, to R2-D2|Vader Down, Part I}}
Though he was unable to acquire the relics in Grakkus' palace, the holocrons he activated gave Skywalker one important piece of information: the existence of a Jedi Temple on Vrogas Vas. Skywalker returned to the Alliance but still sought answers, so he traveled to Vrogas Vas and was stationed in orbit with Red Squadron, along with [[Blue Squadron (Vrogas Vas)|Blue Squadron]] and [[Yellow Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Yellow Squadron]]. While in orbit and preparing for training exercises, Darth Vader<ref name="Vader Down 1">''[[Vader Down, Part I]]''</ref>&mdash;who had learned of Skywalker's location from one of his associates, a rogue [[archaeologist]] named [[Chelli Lona Aphra|Aphra]]<ref name="Vader 12">''[[Darth Vader 12: Shadows and Secrets, Part VI]]''</ref>&mdash;dropped out of hyperspace in his TIE Advanced x1 starfighter. Vader made quick work of Blue Squadron and Yellow Squadron, destroying them both as Red Squadron looked on. Skywalker sensed that Vader was the pilot of the enemy starfighter, made a run towards him, and crashed his X-wing fighter into the Sith Lord's TIE Advanced. The collision damaged both vessels and send them hurtling towards the surface of Vrogas Vas.<ref name="Vader Down 1" />

[[File:Luke senses Obi-Wan and Anakin.png|thumb|right|300px|Skywalker senses the presences of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker in the temple ruins.]]
Skywalker and Vader both survived the crashes of their starfighters, though they impacted on the surface in different places. The young Jedi crashed outside of the ruins of the Jedi Temple, from which he witnessed the destruction of [[Gray Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Gray Squadron]] forces sent to attack Vader&mdash;part of a major Rebel operation to capture the lone Sith Lord. He put off his search for answers and began to make his way towards the Rebel forces, determined to help his friends.<ref name="Vader Down 1" /> As he passed through the ruins of the Jedi Temple, he could see [[Cyan Three|yet another]] Rebel pilot being killed by the Dark Lord. Unknown to Skywalker was that, at the same time, he was being tracked by Vader's companions&mdash;Aphra and the [[assassin droid]]s [[BT-1]] and [[0-0-0]]. While the Sith Lord's followers prepared a plan to capture the boy, Skywalker found writings in the ruins that were written with a lightsaber, letting him deduce that the ruins were from the Jedi. A cold feeling passed over him and he could sense the presence of what he thought was Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. He tried to concentrate, but he was interrupted by what he thought was Threepio's arrival. In reality, it was Triple-Zero, painted in gold by Aphra, who placed his metal hand on Skywalker and sent an electrical charge through the boy's body, knocking him unconscious.<ref name="Vader 13">''[[Darth Vader 13: Vader Down, Part II]]''</ref>

Aphra and Triple-Zero prepared to take Skywalker hostage when Artoo stepped in to help. Bee Tee then brought his arsenal to bear on the rebel's astromech and chased him off. Aphra and Triple-Zero then seized Skywalker but were stopped by the smuggler Han Solo, who had a sniper rifle aimed at them. Chewbacca then came in and attacked the protocal droid, ripping his arm off. Skywalker then regained consciousness, dispatched Bee Tee, and sliced off Triple-Zero's other arm with his lightsaber. Skywalker and his allies then retreated when Bee Tee fired his weapons blindly.<ref name="SW13">''[[Star Wars 13: Vader Down, Part III]]''</ref>

Skywalker, Solo, Chewbacca, and Artoo made their way back to the Millennium Falcon. They then lifted off in order to aid princess Leia. They were forced to the ground when their ship was crashed into by the Wookiee bounty hunter Black Krrsantan. While Solo and Chewbacca dealt with the mercenary, Skywalker left to head back to the Jedi ruins.<ref name="DV14">''[[Darth Vader 14: Vader Down, Part IV]]''</ref>

Luke arrived back at the the Jedi temple looking for Leia. It was then that he heard the voice of Obi-wan Kenobi, who told him that he should not have come to this place and that he was not ready for what is coming. Luke was then intercepted by a company of stormtroopers who opened fire on him. He retreated behind cover but was hit in the head and knocked unconscious.<ref name="SW14">''[[Star Wars 14: Vader Down, Part V]]''</ref>

Luke was taken prisoner by the forces of Commander [[Karbin]]. However Darth Vader, who had a rivalry with Karbin, used the force to crash the shuttle Skywalker was kept in. Now free, he then caught up with Solo, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and R2-D2. They made their way back to the Millennium Falcon, however Dr. Aphra had laid out a minefield to stop them. When she was distracted she was knocked out from behind by Princess Leia. Believing her to be of use, Organa decided to take the archaeologist with them. As they departed Vrogas Vas, Skywalker felt remorse that he would not be able to go back to the temple and see what was hidden there.<ref name="DV15">''[[Darth Vader 15: Vader Down, Part VI]]''</ref>

====Learning the ways of the smuggler====
{{Quote|How else are we gonna replace the money we just lost?''"<br />"''Heh, don't worry, kid. I know just the thing. It's a big galaxy. And believe me, there's always something somewhere in need of smuggling.|Skywalker and Solo|Star Wars 16: Rebel Jail, Part I}}
[[File:SkywalerSoloAndNerfs.png|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker and Solo deliver nerfs on Ibaar.]]
Upon returning to the Rebel fleet with their new prisoner, Doctor Aphra, Skywalker and his friends went their separate ways; Organa, Artoo, and Threepio went to detain Aphra at an Alliance-controlled space station, [[Sunspot Prison]], with the assistance of [[Sana Starros]], whom Organa hired to transport them to the prison. Meanwhile, Solo and Skywalker were dispatched to buy supplies for the rebellion. Solo attempted to double the money he was given for supplies by betting on [[sabacc]]. However, he was caught cheating, and had to escape with Skywalker on the ''Millennium Falcon''.<ref name="SW16">''[[Star Wars 16: Rebel Jail, Part I]]''</ref>

Skywalker and Solo traveled to Nar Shaddaa where Luke was tasked with finding a customer in need of a ship. He made a deal to haul [[nerf]]s to [[Ibaar]] for 5,000 credits, which was just enough to replace the credits lost by Solo. Skywalker and Solo were soon intercepted by TIE fighters who suspected the Falcon of smuggling illegal livestock.<ref name="SW17">''[[Star Wars 17: Rebel Jail, Part II]]''</ref> Luke was able to shoot the fighters and he and Solo made it to Ibaar with the nerfs. While on Ibaar, Skywalker blackmailed Solo into allowing him to fly the Falcon for a few parsecs by threatening to tell Leia about losing the credits in a Sabacc game.<ref name="SW18">''[[Star Wars 18: Rebel Jail, Part III]]''</ref>

After buying the supplies, Skywalker and Solo received a distress call from Sana and arrived at Sunspot Prison. They were immediately knocked out and taken captive by the [[Eneb Ray|masked assailant]] who was attacking the prison. Neither came to until after the battle had already ended and the attacker had been captured.<ref name="SW19">''[[Star Wars 19: Rebel Jail, Part IV]]''</ref>

====Hijacking the ''Harbinger''====
{{Quote|Chances are...This is the last voyage of the ''Harbinger''. So Let's make it a memorable one|Skywalker to Organa and Solo|Star Wars 22: The Last Flight of the Harbinger, Part II}}
Sometime after the assault on Sunspot prison, Skywalker, along with the efforts of Red Squadron, along with Solo, Organa, and Chewbacca in the ''Millennium Falcon'' participated in a [[Hijacking of the Harbinger|hijacking]] of the ''[[Harbinger (Imperial I-class)|Harbinger]]'', an [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|''Imperial''-class Star Destroyer]]. He was crucial to securing the ship after the crew abandoned the mighty warship, barely able to eject the main reactor. Over the next week, he helped repair the ship.<ref name="SW22">''[[Star Wars 22: The Last Flight of the Harbinger, Part II]]''</ref> When the time came to break the [[Siege on Tureen VII]], Skywalker dueled Sergeant Kreel again, whose [[Task Force 99|SCAR Squadron]] had snuck aboard. Using a Force push, Skywalker subdued the trooper, and was able to join the fight in his X-wing.

====The Screaming Citadel====
{{Quote|So, come, shake hands, have dinner with the nice lady, and we walk away with an actual sentient Ancient Jedi.

Sometime later, as the Alliance was setting up a temporary base, Skywalker went to a local cantina. There he was met by Dr. Aphra, who convinced him to [[Mission to Ktath'atn|visit]] the [[Citadel of Ktath'atn|Screaming Citadel]] together. There Aphra introduced him to the [[Queen of Ktath'atn]] as a Jedi. The Queen soon betrayed them, and Aphra turned him over to her as part of a deal to unlock the [[Rur crystal]]. The Queen implanted Skywalker with an [[Abersyn symbiote]]. Due to his power of the Force, he was able to overpower the Queen's own symbiote, causing chaos among the hive. Along with his Rebel friends, who had come to rescue him, they were able to escape, but not before Organa threatened to demote him back to moisture farming. Angered by Aphra's betrayal, Skywalker ordered her not to contact them again.<ref name="The Screaming Citadel">''[[Star Wars: The Screaming Citadel]]'' storyarc</ref>

====Among the stars====

During a mission, he piloted a [[Taylander shuttle]] with Organa. He piloted into a [[nebula]], which disabled it, forcing them to crash on an [[Unidentified ocean planet|ocean planet]] for three weeks. Skywalker's experience with machinery such as [[moisture vaporator]]s helped keep them alive. Realizing that there was a [[Unidentified aquatic species|native species]], so Skywalker and Organa set a trap for the Imperial forces that were pursuing them. After disabling the [[All Terrain Armored Transport (Galactic Civil War)|AT-AT]], they were able to repair the shuttle and return to the Rebel Fleet.<ref name="Star Wars 33">''[[Star Wars 33: Rebels in the Wild]]''</ref>

Shortly afterward, Skywalker and his team intercepted a message from R2-D2, who had gone off alone on a [[Mission to rescue C-3PO|rescue mission]]. They saved R2's X-wing from Darth Vader and left in hyperspace.<ref name="Star Wars 36">''[[Star Wars 36: Revenge of the Astromech]]''</ref>

By then, Task Force 99 had [[Mission to Horox III|destroyed]] the [[Horox III rebel outpost]]. The team arrived there, discovering the devastation. Fearing further danger, they left without burying the rebel troopers, but Skywalker insisted that they honor the dead. Together they built a cremation pile before leaving.<ref name="Star Wars 37">''[[Star Wars 37: Imperial Pride]]''</ref>

====Temporary outpost====
{{Quote|I just go word that the cargo vessel just arrived. Looks like the mission was canceled. Hope you didn't go through too much trouble.|Luke Skywalker to R2-D2|Droid Dilemma}}
Sometime after the hijacking of the ''Harbinger'', the Alliance established a temporary [[LX-Robynsun V Rebel outpost|outpost]] on the Outer Rim planet [[Reamma]]. Leia Organa gave Luke a mission to find a missing Alliance cargo vessel. Skywalker, and his droid R2-D2, prepared to make the flight to look for them. Before they could do that, however, Organa informed Skywalker that the vessel reported in, cancelling the mission.<ref name="Droid Dilemma">{{Shortstory|story=Droid Dilemma|book=Star Wars 25: The Last Flight of the Harbinger, Part V}}</ref>

====Er'Kit====
{{Quote|Rebel intelligence heard some strange things about the Malachor Company, and as soon as I got here to investigate I felt an... echo in the Force. I don't quite know how to explain it, but there's more going on here on Er'Kit than meets the eye.|Luke Skywalker, during the operations on Er'Kit|Star Wars: Commander}}
At some point after becoming a commander of his own, Skywalker was sent to the desert world of [[Er'Kit]], where the locals were being oppressed by a group of [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] known as the [[Malachor Company]]. Upon arriving to Er'Kit to investigate, Skywalker felt mysterious echoes in the Force, which made him think there was more going on there than met the eye. Thus, he requested the help of [[Saponza's partner|an agent]] who had a reputation for desert warfare. Together, the two defeated the outposts and bases of the mercenaries. In order to ensure faster progress, Skywalker and the agent discovered from the Imperial operatives present in the [[sector]] that Imperial supplies had been ferried to Er'Kit via Nar Shaddaa, which meant a big operation. Eventually, Skywalker and the agent arrested the mercenary leader. Skywalker then successfully tracked the last members of the Malachor Company, who had holed themselves in an empty village.<ref name="Commander-Echoes">''[[Star Wars: Commander]]'', Rebel Campaign: ''Echoes of the Force''</ref>

Among the mercenaries' possessions, Skywalker and the agent discovered a document which proved that Malachor Company was preparing to ship supplies somewhere, and its coordinates led Skywalker and the agent to an Imperial base on the planet. They subsequently attacked several of its Imperial bases until they found intelligence pertaining to the Empire's operation on Er'Kit.<ref name="Commander-Echoes" />

Having located the base from which the Imperials deployed most of their [[troop]]s on E'rKit, Skywalker assaulted it with the assistance of Organa. The Rebel forces razed the base, which dealt a huge blow to the Imperial operations on the planet. Although still lacking on information of the Empire's secret experiments on the planet, Skywalker gradually discovered various logs showing that the Malachor Company had been hired by the Imperial Security Bureau. The mercenaries had been forcibly relocating natives to make room for [[Project Hidden Eye]], which aimed at creating [[sleeper operative]]s who would spread throughout the galaxy. The project was nearly ready to send its first wave of spies.<ref name="Commander-Echoes" />

In great haste, Skywalker and the agent took their troops to the base Project Hidden Eye was being run from, defeating its staging area and taking out the installations, ending the Imperial project for good. Skywalker then thanked the agent for their services, but he himself remained on Er'Kit for a time, executing other missions for Rebel Command.<ref name="Commander-Echoes" />

====Hoth====
{{Quote|You will go to the Dagobah system.''"<br />"''Dagobah system?''"<br />"''There, you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me.|Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker|Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}
[[3 ABY|Three]] [[Standard year|years]]<ref name="GA" /> after the Death Star's destruction, Skywalker was transferred to [[Echo Base]] alongside [[Rogue Squadron]] to [[Hoth]], where he participated in regular patrols of the frozen perimeter. Once while reconnoitering the surroundings of Echo Base, Skywalker was attacked by a [[wampa]], only to regain consciousness in its [[cave]]. He severed its arm with his lightsaber, and escaped; after a long walk in the icy wind, he collapsed from exhaustion. Near death, he had a vision of Kenobi, who told him to seek the teachings of Yoda in the [[Dagobah system]].<ref name="Episode V" />

[[File:Luke crashed snowspeeder.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Luke salvaging equipment from his crashed snowspeeder on [[Hoth]].]]
Rescued by Solo, Skywalker recovered from his wounds in a [[bacta tank]]. However, Vader had located Echo Base with one of his [[Viper probe droid|probe droids]] and prepared an imminent attack on the recently-opened Alliance base,<ref name="Episode V" /> thus prompting the Alliance to evacuate the base at once. After bidding farewell to his friends,<ref name="SYWtBaJ?">''[[The Empire Strikes Back: So You Want to Be a Jedi?]]''</ref> for the impending [[Battle of Hoth|battle]], Skywalker led Rogue Squadron in an [[T-47 airspeeder|airspeeder]]. Though he was shot down, and his [[gunner]] [[Dak Ralter]] was killed, he got out of his damaged speeder and single-handedly destroyed a walker with his lightsaber and a [[thermal detonator]]. As Imperial forces breached the Rebels' defenses, the last [[GR-75 medium transport|Rebel transport]] departed, and Skywalker fled the planet aboard his X-wing with R2-D2.<ref name="Episode V" />

====Dagobah====
{{Quote|Will he finish what he begins?''"<br />"''I won't fail you. I'm not afraid.''"<br />"''Oh, you will be. You will be.|Yoda and Luke Skywalker|audio=ImNotAfraid-YouWillBe.ogg|Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}
[[File:Yodalukedagobah.png|thumb|left|300px|Traveling to Dagobah, Skywalker sought out Grand Master Yoda in order to complete his Jedi training.]]
Skywalker then traveled to [[Dagobah]], which turned out to be a remote [[swamp]] planet, where he encountered the former [[Grand Master]] of the fallen Jedi Order, Yoda. In their initial meeting, Skywalker was frustrated and impatient and was rather short-tempered with the diminutive Yoda, who did not initially identify himself and purposefully tested Skywalker's patience, telling him a story about three brothers,<ref name="SYWtBaJ?" /> and taking him back to his [[Yoda's Hut|hut]] to partake in a meal of [[root-leaf stew]], which he did not find very appetizing. However, Skywalker gained a new appreciation for the small creature upon learning his identity, and Yoda agreed to train Skywalker only at the insistence of Kenobi's spirit. Skywalker's training proved to be difficult, as his adventurous past had shaped his mind toward action and emotional instinct.<ref name="Episode V" />

During his training with Yoda, the Jedi Master had Skywalker climb a tree to use his senses to find a way through the tree, Skywalker lost his balance and fell from the tree. Yoda decided to have Skywalker carry him as he redid the task.<ref name="FOD">{{FOD|The Path Ahead}}</ref>

When Yoda asked him to enter a [[Cave of Evil|cave]] that was strong in the [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]] in which he was supposed to find only what he took with him, he was challenged by a vision of himself wearing the [[Vader's armor|armor of Darth Vader]], meant to symbolize his inner darkness.<ref name="Episode V" /> Master and apprentice then had an encounter with a raging [[elephoth]], which Skywalker managed to calm by leading her to her child.<ref name="SYWtBaJ?" /> Shortly after, he had a [[Force vision|vision]] of Han Solo and Leia Organa suffering at [[Cloud City]] on [[Bespin]]. Unable to get the visions out of his head, and convinced that his friends would surely die if he did not help them, Skywalker decided to end his training prematurely to rescue them, despite Yoda and Kenobi's insistence that he was not ready to face the dark side on his own yet, but Skywalker was convinced that he'd learned enough to hold his own, and he could not just stand by and leave his friends to the mercy of the Empire.

Seeing that Skywalker's mind was made up, Kenobi let him know that if he ended up facing Vader, he could not interfere on his behalf, and advised him not to give into hatred. Likewise, Yoda advised him to mind what he'd learned. Skywalker promised to do so, and vowed to return to Dagobah one day to finish his training. <ref name="Episode V" />

====Vader's trap====
{{Quote|Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.''"<br />"''He told me enough! He told me you killed him!''"<br />"''No. ''I'' am your father."<br>"No...that's not true! That's ''impossible''!"<br>"Search your feelings. You ''know'' it to be true."|Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker|audio=IAmYourFather-Full.ogg|Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}
[[File:LukeVSVaderB.png|thumb|right|300px|Skywalker confronted Vader on Bespin while attempting to save his friends.]]
Upon his arrival at Cloud City's [[East Platform]], Skywalker felt Vader's presence,<ref name="SYWtBaJ?" /> and went into the nearest building, where he was shot at by [[Boba Fett]], a [[bounty hunter]] who had come to claim a bounty put on Han Solo by Jabba the Hutt, and tried to pursue a group of stormtroopers and [[Imperial officer]]s who held Organa, Chewbacca, and C-3PO captive. The princess attempted to warn Skywalker that he was walking into a trap, but his path was diverted to the [[carbon-freezing]] [[Carbon-freezing chamber|chamber]] where Darth Vader awaited him, with the intention to freeze him in [[carbonite]] to present him to the [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]]. Skywalker engaged the Dark Lord in a fierce [[Duel on Cloud City|lightsaber duel]].<ref name="Episode V" />

During the duel, Vader praised Skywalker's training in the Force thus far and attempted to goad him into giving into his anger and hatred, claiming that it was the only way to defeat him. Vader managed to knock Skywalker into the carbon-freezing chamber and appeared to have frozen him like he had Solo, but Skywalker [[Force jump|lept]] out of the chamber before the process was finished, which left Vader impressed.

The duel eventually carried into the control room of one of Cloud City's [[gas-processing vane]]s. Vader began using the Force to [[Telekinesis|throw]] various objects in the chamber at the young Jedi hopeful. One such projectile, a large piece of metal piping, was misdirected and smashed through a nearby observation port. The chamber was quickly depresurized, sucking Skywalker out onto the nearby sensor relay catwalk overlooking the [[reactor shaft]]. Skywalker managed to grab on to the catwalk's railing and pull himself up.

Vader re-entered the fray and forced Skywalker back onto the catwalk. Sensing that Skywalker was weakened, the Sith Lord demanded that Skywalker surrender, lest he be destroyed the same way that Obi-Wan Kenobi had. Skywalker refused and desperately tried to keep fighting Vader, to which Vader responded with several ferocious strikes, ultimately forcing Skywalker to the very edge of the catwalk and slicing off his right hand. Both Skywalker's hand and his lightsaber fell into the depths of the reactor shaft.

[[File:Luke_whining.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The revelation that Vader was Skywalker's father shook the Jedi hopeful to his core.]]
Seeing that Skywalker was vulnerable in his weakened state, Vader offered to show Skywalker the power of the dark side and complete his training, with Skywalker vehemently refusing to ever join Vader, the man who had killed his father. In that moment, Vader revealed the truth: that ''he'' was his father.

Horrified by this shocking revelation, Skywalker harshly denied this claim, but Vader insinuated that they both knew that it was the truth. Vader insisted that Skywalker could destroy the Emperor, and together they could rule the galaxy as father and son.<ref name="Episode V" /><ref name="BtPotDS!">''[[Return of the Jedi: Beware the Power of the Dark Side!]]''</ref> Unwilling to join Vader but too weak to fight back, Skywalker took the only option he had left, and allowed himself to fall down the reactor shaft, being sucked through several vents and eventually being deposited to the outside of the floating city. Though he managed to grab onto a [[Weather scanner vane|weather vane]] to avoid falling to his death, he knew he was unable to stay there forever, especially in his weakened state. Calling out to Kenobi at first but getting no response, in desperation, he called out to Leia Organa through the Force, who was able to hear the call.

Soon, the ''Millennium Falcon'', with [[Lando Calrissian]], Organa, Chewbacca, and the droids onboard, arrived to rescue him. As they [[Escape from Cloud City|escaped]] from Bespin, and the ''Falcon'' was faced with the Imperial fleet, Vader reached out to Skywalker through the Force, calling him "son."<ref name="Episode V" /> Skywalker fought tears back, after hearing the word he had always longed to hear while lamenting that Kenobi had not told him the truth,<ref name="SYWtBaJ?" /> just as the ''Falcon'' made the jump into hyperspace thanks to R2-D2. Back at the Rebel fleet, Skywalker received a [[Mechno-arm|prosthetic hand]] onboard the [[EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate|Nebulon-B frigate]] ''[[Redemption]]'', while Calrissian and Chewbacca set out to find Solo.<ref name="Episode V" />

====Zastiga====
{{Quote|Weapons and war don't make you a Jedi. I know that now.|Luke Skywalker|Moving Target: A Princess Leia Adventure}}
After the command of Red Squadron was transferred to Antilles following his promotion to squadron leader, which pleased Skywalker,<ref name="BtPotDS!" /> he declined to rejoin the squadron and chose to be stationed onboard the ''Redemption''.<ref name="Moving Target">''[[Moving Target: A Princess Leia Adventure]]''</ref> When he went to [[Zastiga]], he and R2-D2 were the ones to greet Organa on her arrival to the planet after she and C-3PO left the ''[[Mellcrawler (starship)|Mellcrawler]]'', piloted by its owner [[Nien Nunb]] and Lieutenant [[Caluan Ematt]]. When the time came for Organa to attend the top clearance meeting with the Rebel leadership, Skywalker and Nunb met with Antilles for a discussion of "reconnaissance tactics" about Antilles' refusal to pay the [[Sullustan]] a drink. He would later return to escort Organa to her quarters before going to his, and two days later, he saw her off, before catching his own shuttle back to the ''Redemption''.<ref name="Moving Target" />

Soon afterwards, he would go to [[Kothlis]], where he would learn of Solo's location—still frozen in carbonite and kept in Jabba the Hutt's palace—, and where he would keep himself up-to-date with the status of the Alliance Fleet's assembly. He had already devised a plan to rescue Solo when Organa contacted him following the successful [[Operation Yellow Moon]], and showed eagerness to join him on his attempts to [[Rescue of Han Solo|rescue]] the [[Corellian]] smuggler.<ref name="Moving Target" />

====Solo's rescue====
{{Quote|I am taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this or be destroyed. It's your choice, but I warn you not to underestimate my powers.|Luke Skywalker, to Jabba Desilijic Tiure|audio=IAmTakingCaptainSolo.ogg|Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi}}
[[File:Lukeonskiff.png|thumb|right|250px|Skywalker returned to Tatooine in order to rescue Solo from Jabba Desilijic Tiure.]]
In [[4 ABY]],<ref name="GA" /> Skywalker set in motion the plan to rescue Solo from Jabba the Hutt.<ref name="Episode VI" /> Once again, Skywalker returned to Tatooine, and to Kenobi's hut, wherein he found the missing parts he needed for the construction of [[Luke Skywalker's green lightsaber|his own lightsaber]], the pieces left to him by Kenobi. While his friends bustled about preparing for the rescue, Skywalker retreated into the solitude of a desert cave they had chosen as their rendezvous point. Using the Force to assemble the weapon, he brought the [[kyber crystal]] inside to life, making the weapon his own, almost an extension of himself.<ref name="BtPotDS!" />

Afterwards, Skywalker waited to see if Organa's impersonation of [[Boushh]] and liberation of Solo was successful without his intervention, but she was only half-successful. She then sent a message to Skywalker and Calrissian that she had been captured as well, prompting Skywalker to act and go to Jabba's Palace.<ref name="BtPotDS!" /> Skillful use of the Force allowed Skywalker to get past Jabba's [[Gamorrean]] guards and his [[majordomo]], [[Bib Fortuna]], but the Hutt was not so easily swayed and attempted to feed Skywalker to his [[rancor]].<ref name="Episode VI" />

Skywalker killed the monster, but Jabba was furious and sentenced all the captured Alliance heroes–including an unfrozen Solo–to death in the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]] to be eaten by the [[sarlacc]] that resided there. However, right before he was put into the pit, Skywalker escaped when R2-D2 shot his lightsaber to him and freed the other prisoners on the [[skiff]]. A skirmish ensued in which Skywalker protected his friends, ended the life of several of Jabba's thugs including [[Klaatu]],<ref name="BtPotDS!" /> and helped Organa escape the ''[[Khetanna]]'' after she had killed the Hutt. After destroying the [[sail barge]], Skywalker and his entire team escaped unscathed through a dangerous [[sandstorm]], after which he boarded his X-Wing with R2-D2 and parted ways with the others.<ref name="Episode VI" />

====Keeping the promise====
{{Quote|Your father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I told you was true, from a certain point of view.|Obi-Wan Kenobi to Luke Skywalker|Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi}}
Skywalker then returned to Dagobah to complete his training and keep the promise he had made to Yoda,<ref name="Episode VI" /> but the aged Jedi Master, who had used the Force to prolong his life beyond what was natural, had fallen ill and was finally starting to succumb to age. Yoda told Skywalker that he'd already completed all the training he required, but in order to finally become a true Jedi, he needed to confront Darth Vader one more time. <ref name="BtPotDS!" /><ref name="Episode VI" /> Having grown less and less sure since the revelation, Skywalker feared that it was the truth,<ref name="BtPotDS!" /> he inquired if Vader was truly his father. Skywalker received such confirmation from Yoda,<ref name="Episode VI" /> which angered him that they had lied to him for so long, but Yoda confessed that he knew that Skywalker had not been ready to shoulder the burden of being the child of the Dark Lord of the Sith, to which Skywalker expressed his regret that he did not listen to him the first time.<ref name="BtPotDS!" /> After warning him not to underestimate the Emperor's [[Force power|powers]] or allow the dark side to take hold of him, and that as "the last of the Jedi" he had to pass on what he had learned, Yoda made one final revelation to Skywalker before he became one with the Force—that there was "another Skywalker."<ref name="Episode VI" />

Sensing his turmoil,<ref name="BtPotDS!" /> the spirit of Kenobi appeared before Skywalker, who confronted him for lying about his father. Claiming that the good man that Anakin Skywalker had been had died upon his fall to the dark side, Kenobi stated that he did not directly lie to him about his father; he was simply telling him what happened "from a certain point of view." Skywalker voiced his belief that there was still good within his father, and that he could not bring himself to kill him, but Kenobi insisted that he needed to face him again in order to restore balance to the Force. Skywalker then asked about the "other Skywalker", who Kenobi told him was his long-lost twin sister, who had been separated from him at birth to protect them from the wrath of the Empire. Skywalker instantly came to the realization that this sister was Organa, which was confirmed by Kenobi.<ref name="Episode VI" /> Skywalker almost immediately inquired about their mother's identity and fate, but Kenobi asked him to let that truth stay with him for a while longer, as he knew Skywalker carried too many burdens already.<ref name="BtPotDS!" />

====Endor's test====
{{Quote|Now, go, my son. Leave me.''"<br />"''No. You're coming with me. I'll not leave you here. I've got to save you!''"<br />"''You already have, Luke. You were right. You were right about me. Tell your sister&hellip; you were right.|Anakin Skywalker and Luke Skywalker|audio=YouWereRight.ogg|Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi}}
[[File:Luke on Endor.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker left his allies on Endor, believing he endangered the mission.]]
Skywalker nevertheless accompanied his friends on the mission to the forested [[moon]] of [[Endor]] to destroy the [[Death Star's shield generator|shield generator]] that protected the [[Death Star II]] in [[orbit]], volunteering immediately upon arrival at the Rebel briefing above [[Sullust]]. As they approached the moon on the stolen [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle|''Lambda''-class Imperial shuttle]] ''[[Tydirium]]'', Skywalker sensed Vader's presence on the nearby [[Executor-class Star Dreadnought|Super Star Destroyer]] ''[[Executor]]'' and realized his presence was endangering the mission; yet, it was his presence that prompted Vader to allow their landing. Upon doing so, the Rebel force was discovered by a small force of [[Scout trooper|Imperial scout troopers]] that were guarding the shield bunker, and Skywalker and Organa pursued them on [[74-Z speeder bike|speeder bikes]]. Though they successfully stopped the scouts, Organa became separated from Skywalker.<ref name="Episode VI" />

Upon learning of her disappearance, Solo, Skywalker, Chewbacca, and the droids went looking for her, only to be captured by a tribe of [[Ewok]]s. Using the Force to prove C-3PO’s [[Deity|deific]] "[[Magick|magic]]", Skywalker convinced the Ewoks to release them and, after C-3PO's tale of their adventures, the whole group was accepted as a part of the [[Bright Tree Village|village]].<ref name="Episode VI" /> However, Skywalker felt as Vader reached out to him through the Force and landed on the moon,<ref name="BtPotDS!" /> and knew that he had to confront Vader. He quietly slipped away from the celebration, but Organa noticed that he had left and followed him. He informed her of what he was planning to do and also told her that, in the event that he did not make it back, she would the last hope of the Alliance, going on to tell her that she was his sister, and she could use the Force too.<ref name="Episode VI" />

Organa was initially shocked that she and Skywalker were actually brother and sister, but admitted to him that, somehow, she'd always known, and attempted to dissuade him from confronting their father, but Skywalker was adamant that he could redeem Vader, and set off.<ref name="Episode VI" />

Eventually encountering an Imperial patrol and willingly surrendering himself, Skywalker was brought to Vader and tried to convince his father to renounce the dark side by referring to him as "Anakin Skywalker", but Vader harshly denounced his former name.<ref name="Episode VI" /> Although he managed to make Vader question the dark truths that had long ruled him,<ref name="BtPotDS!" /> Skywalker ultimately became a prisoner of the Emperor as he was escorted to his [[Emperor's Throne Room|throne room]] onboard the Death Star<ref name="Episode VI" />

As he was brought before Emperor Palpatine, the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] repeatedly told the young Jedi that he would fall to the dark side just as easily as Vader had, and let him know that he had purposely allowed the Alliance to discover the second Death Star's location in order to lure them into a trap and finish them off once and for all.<ref name="Episode VI" />

[[File:MP-Duel6.png|thumb|right|300px|Skywalker confronted Vader on the second Death Star, believing he could redeem his father in spite of the Emperor's control over him.]]
In order to temper Skywalker's negative emotions, Palpatine forced him to watch as the [[Imperial Fleet]] [[Battle of Endor|engaged]] the Rebels. He constantly encouraged Skywalker to give into his anger and hatred. Though Skywalker was resistant at first, his feelings of hopelessness and desperation only grew as the destruction of the Rebel fleet and the death of his friends appeared imminent. Attempting to strike down the Emperor, Skywalker found himself once again facing his father in a duel. Unlike their previous encounter on Bespin (where Vader was largely able to dominate the proceedings, throughout), this time the pair would fight as equals.

After successfully parrying a flurry of blows, Skywalker sent Vader tumbling down a stairwell before regaining his composure and appealing to the good in his father. Vader would have none of it and attacked once again, though eventually Skywalker withdrew from combat altogether and refused to fight Vader any further, retreating into the shadows of the throne room.<ref name="Episode VI" />

In order to goad his son back into fighting him, Vader used [[telepathy]] to probe his thoughts, learning of the existence of his daughter and Skywalker's twin sister, stating that perhaps she could be seduced to the dark side if Skywalker could not. This statement pushed Skywalker over the edge and caused him to finally give into his rage. Attacking his father much more aggressively this time, he unleashed his full might upon the Sith Lord. Eventually pushing Vader into a corner, right next to the Death Star's reactor shaft, Skywalker repeatedly struck him with multiple heavy blows, and with one final, devastating strike of his lightsaber, sliced Vader's hand off at the wrist, sending it&mdash;and the weapon it still gripped&mdash;cascading down into the depths below.<ref name="Episode VI" />

A cackling Sidious, delighted that Skywalker had not only given into his hatred, but made use of it to such an extent, encouraged him to deliver the killing blow to his father and take his place as his apprentice. However, Skywalker noticed that the hand he'd cut off was mechanical, much like his own, and in a moment of realization, saw that he was about to become what he had sought to destroy. Skywalker tossed his lightsaber aside and defiantly declared to the Emperor that he had failed, and that he was a Jedi like his father before him.<ref name="Episode VI" />

Infuriated that his plan to corrupt Luke had gone up in smoke, Palpatine declared that, if Skywalker would not be turned, he would be destroyed, and unleashed a barrage of [[Force lightning]] against him. Unprepared for the lightning, Skywalker desperately tried to protect himself, to no avail.<ref name="Episode VI" /> Wanting Skywalker to suffer as much pain as possible for daring to defy him, the Sith Master gradually increased the intensity of his lightning,{{Fact}} all while intermittently taunting him. At this point, Vader had gotten back to his feet and returned to his master's side, and Luke begged his father to save him.<ref name="Episode VI" /> Sidious briefly relented his assault, believing that he'd done enough damage to kill him, but upon seeing that Skywalker was still alive, unleashed another, more powerful, barrage of lightning upon him, clearly not planning to stop until Skywalker was reduced to a charred husk.{{Fact}}

Eventually, seeing his son in such terrible pain became too great for Vader to bear any longer, and in that moment, the Sith Lord Darth Vader was gone, and the Jedi Anakin Skywalker was reborn. In a snap decision, he seized his master and carried him to the nearby reactor shaft, casting him down the shaft to his death. In doing so, however, he turned Sidious's lethal Force lightning on himself, irreparably damaging his life-supporting armor.<ref name="Episode VI" />

[[File:Anakinredeemed.png|thumb|left|300px|Vader found redemption through his son and fulfilled the prophecy of the Chosen One before ultimately dying as Anakin Skywalker.]]
Luke carried Anakin to the [[Lambda-class T-4a shuttle|Imperial shuttle]] ''[[ST 321]]'',<ref name="BtPotDS!" /> where his father asked him to remove his breathing mask. Though Luke was hesitant to do so, convinced that his father would die without it, Anakin told him that nothing could prevent his death now, but before he died, he wanted to look upon his son with his own eyes. Luke relented and removed the mask, gazing upon his father's real face for the first and only time. Anakin then encouraged Luke to leave him and save himself. Though Luke was insistent on saving Anakin, his father assured him that, by bringing him back to the light, he already saved him, and with his last words, told him to tell Leia that he'd been right about him before passing away.<ref name="Episode VI" /> At the cost of his own life and with the help of his son, Anakin Skywalker had finally fulfilled his destiny as the [[Chosen One]] and had brought balance to the Force.{{Fact}}

Skywalker took his father's body on board the shuttle and escaped just before the Death Star's destruction,<ref name="Episode VI" /> when he was almost intercepted by [[Green Squadron (Rebel Alliance)|Green Squadron]]{{'s}} [[Shara Bey]], who proceeded to cover him from [[TIE/IN interceptor|TIE interceptors]] after he identified himself.<ref name="SE1">''[[Shattered Empire, Part I]]''</ref> Back on Endor, Skywalker [[Funeral of Anakin Skywalker|cremated his father's armor]] (his body had vanished) in the manner of a [[Jedi funeral|Jedi's funeral]], and then joined his friends and sister in the celebration. It was during this moment of celebration that Skywalker saw the onlooking Force spirits of Kenobi, Yoda, and his father, looking at him in approval and with a sense of peace.<ref name="BtPotDS!" /><ref name="Episode VI" />

Following the Battle of Endor, Skywalker and Organa helped the Ewoks [[Kneesaa]] and [[Wicket W. Warrick]] reset their traps to stop a [[Gorax]]. Sensing that Ewoks and Organa needed time to complete the task, Skywalker used his lightsaber to slice through a log that the Gorax had thrown at him before he threw his lightsaber to Organa to use to cut a log.<ref name="T&T">{{FOD|Traps and Tribulations}}</ref>

In the battle's aftermath, Skywalker reported to the Rebel Alliance that the Emperor and Darth Vader were dead. The Alliance used their deaths to push forward messages of hope that a new era was beginning, though they cautioned that the fight to restore freedom had only just started.<ref name="Aftermath">''[[Aftermath]]''</ref> In the days ahead, the Rebel Alliance began the formation of the [[New Republic]], a successor state to the Galactic Republic. The Empire, meanwhile, reeled from its defeat and its leadership was in chaos, and the Imperial government claimed that the reports of the Emperor's demise were treasonous propaganda.<ref name="Shattered Empire 2">''[[Shattered Empire, Part II]]''</ref>

====Pillio====
{{Quote|If the Empire is here, then what I sensed is true. There must be something special about this place.|Luke Skywalker to R2-D2|Star Wars Battlefront II}}
[[File:Inside the Pillio Observatory.png|thumb|right|300px|Skywalker encountered Del Meeko during his search for the Emperor's Observatory on Pillio.]]
Not long after the Battle of Endor, Skywalker felt a calling from [[Pillio]] in the [[Jinata system]]. Chasing the call, Luke along with R2 took his X-wing and set course for the remote aquatic planet. When they arrived, the two came across an Imperial Shuttle making its descent, confirming Skywalker's suspicions that the planet held something of importance. He left his faithful Astromech Droid with his ship, and it was not long before the young Jedi encountered Stormtroopers on guard, who attacked him on sight. Skywalker made his way through several dozens of troopers and officers, remarking that the Empire must have been searching the planet. Sensing something unnatural from within a nearby cave, the Jedi found that native wildlife, [[Scritter]]s, were attacking the invading imperials. Hearing cries for help, Skywalker made his way further into the depths of the planet to find [[Del Meeko]], a member of [[Imperial Special Forces]] Unit [[Inferno Squad]], with his arm stuck in the amber of the Scritters. Despite their different allegiances, Skywalker used his lightsaber to cut through the amber and free the soldier. When Meeko asked why the Jedi helped him, Skywalker simply responded, 'Because you asked'.<ref name="Battlefront II">''[[Star Wars Battlefront II]]''</ref>

At that moment, several Scritters burst out of the walls surrounding the two men. Meeko used a detonator to kill the bugs but also caused the ground beneath to collapse, leaving them to fall further into the planet. They landed in a small shallow stream of water, and Skywalker used the Force to protect Meeko from falling rocks. After being helped to his feet, Meeko remarked that stories of the Jedi always scared him as a young boy. Skywalker responded that if they want to get out, they'll need to work together. Making their way through the caves, Luke shared that the Force has brought them to together and apologizes for killing the rest of his men; he was reluctant to do so, but they left him no choice, while Meeko did. As the two made their way out of the cave, Del revealed that the Emperor had an observatory on the planet and that Meeko was tasked with destroying it. Skywalker and Meeko eventually escaped the cave and gained access to the observatory by destroying its defense system.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

Skywalker discovered that the key to opening the vault door is to use the Force, prompting Meeko to wonder why the observatory could only be opened by the Force and if the man who hunted down the Jedi was secretly one of them. Luke suggested that Del had learned to fear the wrong thing. The two investigated the vault, apparently full of junk, and Skywalker took a compass. When Meeko asked why he should be allowed to keep it, Skywalker responded, 'Because I asked'. As the two left, Skywalker remarked that the Empire had done enough damage to innocent worlds and that Meeko could choose not between the Empire or the Rebellion, but to be a better person. He wished the Force with Meeko before leaving.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

====Vetine====
{{Quote|And ''why'' exactly are we doing this?''"<br />"''Because in the ''lab'' at the heart of that base is something the Emperor ''stole'' a long time ago. We're taking it ''back''.|Shara Bey and Luke Skywalker|Shattered Empire, Part IV}}
[[File:Luke Skywalker Shara Bey.png|thumb|left|300px|Skywalker and Shara Bey recovered the last fragments of the Great Tree from the Imperial research base on Vetine.]]
In [[5 ABY]],<ref name="Note">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' says that [[Shara Bey]] and [[Kes Dameron]] moved to [[Yavin 4]] in [[5 ABY]]. They moved shortly after the mission to [[Vetine]], placing this event in 5 ABY.</ref> three [[Standard month|months]] after the Battle of Endor, Skywalker planned a [[Mission to Vetine|mission]] to an [[Imperial base (Vetine)|Imperial research base]] on the planet [[Vetine]] in order to retrieve the last remaining fragment of a [[Great Tree (Coruscant)|Force-sensitive tree]]. The tree, which once dwelled in the heart of the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, was stolen by the Emperor after he came to power and converted the Jedi Temple into the Imperial Palace. Skywalker recruited Shara Bey to fly as his co-pilot on the mission, and, along with Artoo, they flew a stolen Imperial shuttle, ''[[Antarra]]'', to Vetine. While en route, Skywalker told Bey about the plan, including how she would pose as ISB Agent [[Alecia Beck]], using codes obtained by Solo and the Pathfinders during a [[raid at the Wretch of Tayron|raid]] on an ISB base at the [[Wretch of Tayron|Wretch]] of [[Tayron]]. Upon their arrival, Bey claimed she was Agent Beck and that she had arrived to perform an unannounced inspection. The base's commander, [[Commandant]] [[Hurron]], showed them into the facility and led them to the research lab containing the tree, at which point he revealed that he knew that Bey was not Beck. Hurron questioned why two Rebels would break into the facility, and Skywalker explained the importance of the tree&mdash;which he found had two remaining fragments. Skywalker and Bey fought their way out of the base, making their way through numerous stormtroopers who attempted to stop their escape. Once back at ''Antarra'', Hurron ordered his forces to throw thermal detonators at the escaping Rebels, but Skywalker used the Force to deflect them back, killing Hurron and several of his stormtroopers in an explosion.<ref name="Shattered Empire 4">''[[Shattered Empire, Part IV]]''</ref>

The Rebel trio made their way back towards the Alliance Fleet. During the trip back, Skywalker and Bey discussed the latter's future plans for service in the Rebellion, as Skywalker knew that Bey was considering leaving the Alliance to reunite with her husband, Pathfinder Sergeant [[Kes Dameron]], and their son [[Poe Dameron|Poe]]. Bey was unsure as to whether she wanted to leave the Rebels behind, but Skywalker's guidance helped Bey decide to leave the Alliance. The Jedi Knight gifted one of the tree fragments to her, as he had only expected to find one, believing that the important relic would be kept safe with Bey and her family. She and Dameron planted it outside of their [[Yavin 4 colony|new home]] on Yavin 4.<ref name="Shattered Empire 4" />

===Restoring the Jedi Order===
{{Quote|He was training a new generation of Jedi. There was no one else left to do it, so he took the burden on himself.

He walked away from everything.|Han Solo|Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)}}
The Galactic Civil War came to a close with the signing of the [[Galactic Concordance]], a peace treaty between the Republic and the Empire that forced the Empire to remain within pre-established borders, though the remnants of the once-powerful military force disappeared into the [[Unknown Regions]].<ref name="TFA VD">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> Following the signing of the treaty, Han and Leia gave birth to their son and Luke's nephew, [[Kylo Ren|Ben Solo]]. There were rumors that Luke visited his sister and Han before disappearing on an untold mission. Others claimed that his absence was conspicuous.<ref name="Empire's End">''[[Aftermath: Empire's End]]''</ref>

Following the Empire's defeat, Skywalker continued to seek out Jedi lore, hoping to find information that the Empire had erased, [[Gatalenta]] being one of the first destinations in his search.<ref name="Bloodline" /> He was aided by [[Lor San Tekka]], an explorer and member of the [[Church of the Force]].<ref name="San Tekka DB">{{Databank|lor-san-tekka|Lor San Tekka}}</ref> San Tekka was old enough to remember the Jedi Knights before the Clone Wars, and he did not believe the Emperor's lies about how the Jedi betrayed the Old Republic.<ref name="TFA VD" /> San Tekka, who believed that the return of the Jedi Order was essential to bring balance to the Force,<ref name="Episode VII" /> became a valuable ally for both Skywalker and Organa.<ref name="TFA VD" /> During this time, Skywalker began to teach Organa the ways of the Force as his first apprentice. Organa learned some basics but ultimately decided her destiny lied in the political arena in the fledgling New Republic.<ref name="TLJ VD" />

Sometime during his search for Jedi lore, Skywalker discovered the [[Jocasta Nu's school|school]] of [[Chief Librarian]] [[Jocasta Nu]].<ref name="DLOTS">''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 10: The Dying Light, Part IV]]''</ref>

Fulfilling the dying wish of Jedi Master Yoda,<ref name="Episode VI" /> Skywalker set out to begin training a new generation of Jedi, passing on everything that he had learned in his own training. He based his new Jedi Order at a secret [[Luke Skywalker's Jedi Temple|Jedi Temple]] of which only those in his order and his loyal droid R2-D2 knew the location.

He found a dozen Force-sensitives who became his Padawans, including his nephew, Ben. Ben's parents could tell that he felt the pull of the dark side of the Force and feared he was much like his grandfather, so they sent him to be trained by Skywalker in the hopes that it would help him and purge the darkness from him.

[[File:Luke's Mistake.png|thumb|right|300px|Sensing the darkness within Ben Solo, Skywalker instinctively moved to strike down his nephew.]]
During this time, a powerful dark side-practitioner known as [[Snoke]], who was the [[Supreme Leader]] of a splinter group of the Empire known as the [[First Order]], began influencing Ben from afar, clouding him with the dark side. Luke sensed this and, one night, began to probe Ben's mind as he lay asleep. Seeing that Snoke had overthrown his apprentice's heart with the dark side, Luke claimed that he sensed that Ben would bring nothing but death and destruction if he did not act, and for a brief moment raised his lightsaber to destroy him, believing that it was the only way to halt his descent into darkness. This instinct was gone almost the second that it had come, and Luke was immediately filled with shame.

Ben had already awoken to see his uncle standing over him with his lightsaber raised. Confused and angry, Ben [[Force pull|pulled]] his own [[Ben Solo's lightsaber|lightsaber]] to him in self-defense and attacked Luke, using the Force to pull down the hut on top of him. When Luke came around, he emerged from the rubble of the hut to find his temple destroyed, with his other apprentices either killed or gone to follow Ben. Ben eventually became the apprentice of Snoke and took the new name "Kylo Ren", becoming the leader of a group of dark side warriors known as the [[Knights of Ren]], some of which included Luke's other apprentices that survived.

Left deeply affected and mentally broken by what he believed to be his ultimate failure, Luke lost faith in the Force and the vision of the Jedi, and fled into self-imposed exile, vanishing from the galaxy at-large without a trace. No one knew for sure where he went, but those closest to him believed he went off in search of the [[first Jedi Temple]]. The Jedi Master eventually discovered the location of the Temple on an aquatic planet named [[Ahch-To]], where he made his exile and shut himself off from the Force.<ref name="Episode VII" />

[[File:Force Vision of Jedi Massacre TFA.png|thumb|left|300px|Solo destroyed the new generation of Jedi, leaving Skywalker with shame and remorse.]]
To those who knew what Skywalker was seeking, there remained a way to find him: after destroying the Jedi, the Empire had begun to seek out the thousands of Jedi temples scattered across the galaxy, with the aim to prevent anyone from discovering the lost secrets of the Order. As such, Imperial authorities discovered the locations of some of the first Jedi Temples, including the one on Ahch-To. The information remained within the archives of the Empire, the access to which was severely restricted after the Galactic Civil War. The First Order was able to acquire most of the map, save for a fraction which was apparently stolen by Lor San Tekka. As he had downloaded most of the information possessed by the Empire during his time on the Death Star, R2-D2, Skywalker's faithful astromech, was also able to recover the contents of the map, but only by going into low power mode, which allowed him to sort through the wealth of information present in the Empire's archives.<ref name="TFA novel">[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)|''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' novelization]]</ref>

===Exile on Ahch-To===
{{Quote|...Luke Skywalker may be the only hope we have left.|General Leia Organa|Before the Awakening}}
[[File:Old_Luke.png|thumb|right|250px|After exiling himself to Ahch-To, Skywalker resolved to die as the last Jedi.]]
Absent though he may have been from galactic affairs, Skywalker's story was nonetheless a thing of myth and legend in certain corners of the galaxy. His exploits in the Galactic Civil War were known to the [[Resistance]], a band of freedom fighters led by now-General Organa to [[Cold war|combat]] the rise of the First Order. Resistance fighter pilot [[Jessika Pava]] learned that C-3PO, who also served in the Resistance, knew Skywalker and asked the droid to tell her a story about his former master. Threepio regaled her with the tale of Skywalker's encounter with Sarco Plank on Devaron, and how Skywalker kept his promise to Farnay and indeed returned to Devaron.<ref name="weapon-jedi" /> Members of the First Order, however, had a less-than-ideal view of the Jedi Master; the First Order taught their followers, including [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtroopers]] like [[Finn|FN-2187]], that Skywalker was an enemy who helped destroy the Empire. Despite the knowledge about Skywalker, the mystical elements of his life, as well as the Jedi in general, were seen as mythic rather than historic.<ref name="EW Luke">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/11/12/where-is-luke-skywalker-star-wars|title=Where is Luke Skywalker? J.J. Abrams and Mark Hamill grapple with the question|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=November 12, 2015|accessdate=November 12, 2015}}</ref>

In [[34 ABY]], thirty years after the Battle of Endor, Organa sent Resistance fighter Poe Dameron,<ref name="Episode VII" /> the son of Shara Bey and Kes Dameron,<ref name="TFA VD" /> to Jakku to find San Tekka and recover the map to Skywalker's alleged location, as she hoped her brother would return and help in the fight against the dark side. The First Order also learned of the map and sought it so they could destroy the last Jedi. Dameron found San Tekka living in the village of [[Tuanul]], and the old explorer gave the map to Dameron, who in turn gave it to his astromech droid [[BB-8]], before Kylo Ren and the First Order arrived and [[Attack on Tuanul|sacked]] the village. Ren killed San Tekka and took Dameron into custody in the hopes of finding the map, while BB-8 came into the possession of a Jakku [[scavenger]] named [[Rey]]. Rey believed that Skywalker was only a myth, but she too possessed strength in the Force that she had not yet discovered. Rey teamed with [[FN-2187]], an ex-Stormtrooper who took the name Finn after defecting from the First Order, and, with the help of Han Solo and Chewbacca, sought to return the map fragment to the Resistance.<ref name="Episode VII" />

[[File:Luke Skywalker Found TFA.png|thumb|left|300px|Rey, a scavenger from Jakku, implored Skywalker to help the Resistance against the First Order.]]
After Rey discovered the lightsaber that once belonged to both Anakin and Luke in the [[Maz Kanata's castle|pirate castle]] belonging to [[Maz Kanata]] on [[Takodana]], a thousand year-old being who had knowledge of the Force, she began to unlock her own Force abilities. After being captured by Ren on Takodana and briefly interrogated onboard [[Starkiller Base]] in an attempt by Ren to analyze Rey's thoughts to find the path to Skywalker, BB-8's map fragment was soon combined with R2-D2's, and together they provided a complete map to Ahch-To. Accompanied by Chewbacca, Rey flew the ''Millenium Falcon'' to Ahch-to and found the old Jedi Master on an island.<ref name="Episode VII" /> Shortly afterwards, one night, Skywalker had a dream while sleeping at his hut. In his dream, he saw the life he would never have, one in which he never left Tatooine and remained in the moisture farming business with his uncle, marrying Camie Marstrap and allowing the Galactic Empire to shatter the Rebel Alliance and destroy more planets with the Death Star, though there was a thing in common to his actual life: he regretted never having a child like his sister. However, as with all dreams, Luke eventually awoke and saw that his unhappy life was still the same.<ref name="Expanded Edition">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: Expanded Edition]]''</ref>

When Rey arrived on the island, Skywalker was standing up top the [[Saddle (Ahch-To)|saddle]], summoning the will to try to torch the [[tree library]] again having just failed to do so.<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> While standing there, Skywalker was reflecting that his efforts to block the Force from him was impossible as it always demanded to be heard. But in that moment, the old Jedi Master felt that someone had found him, turning around to see who was, discovering Rey.<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 1">''[[The Last Jedi Adaptation 1]]''</ref> After making her way to Skywalker, Rey presented him with his father's old weapon as a symbol of the only hope that the galaxy had left.<ref name="TFA novel" />

===A reluctant teacher and enlightenment===
{{Quote|You think what? I'm going to walk out with a laser sword and face down the whole First Order? |Luke Skywalker to Rey|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}
[[File:LeiaMessageTLJ.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Though reluctant to take on another apprentice, Skywalker chose to train Rey after R2-D2 replayed Organa's call for help.]]
After taking his father's lightsaber and looking it over, Skywalker tossed it behind him and left the plateau, with Rey following close behind him.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Secluding himself in his hut, Skywalker saw his old clothes that he never expected the delusions of grandeur he had when he was a child with a worthless antique.<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 1" /> Despite her repeated attempts, Skywalker declined to help her or the Resistance, even though he knew that the young woman had been sent by his sister Leia. Eventually, Rey and Chewbacca broke into Skywalker's hut as Skywalker ordered Rey to go away and they revealed that Han was dead, stunning Skywalker.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Feeling regret for not having sensed his brother-in-law's death for having disconnected himself from the Force, Luke was comforted by the Wookiee, who hugged him.<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 1" /> When Rey discovered several original texts of Jedi teachings hidden within a sacred tree on the island, Skywalker learned that she had the Force within her and sought assistance to understand it and her place in the galaxy. Skywalker revealed that he had come to the place where the Jedi started in order to die, and voiced his belief that it was time for the Jedi Order to die.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

The next night, the former Jedi Master slipped into the ''Millennium Falcon'' and recalled the adventures he had experienced. While aboard, Skywalker reunited with R2 who, after he insisted that he could not be convinced to help, replayed Leia's holographic message to Kenobi. This inspired Skywalker to agree to give Rey some basic initiation training as a Jedi, explaining the basic foundations of the Force. During the first lesson, Rey sensed the presence of the dark side cavern underneath the island, causing the ground to shake around them as Rey felt the pull of the dark side. It was at this moment that Skywalker realized Rey's level of power was identical to that of his nephew Ben, causing him to worry whether he should train another with such power and to promptly abandon the lesson. He later found Rey practicing with her [[quarterstaff]] and then with the returned lightsaber. He silently watched from afar and his concern and dismay only increased when he witnessed her speed and ferocity with the weapon allowing her to slice through several rock formations apart with ease.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

[[File:Luke interrupting Rey and Kylo Ren.png|thumb|left|300px|Disturbed by Rey's growing connection to Kylo Ren, Skywalker demanded that she leave the island.]]
Eventually after the second lesson, Skywalker revealed that his nephew Ben had the same tremendous power in the Force she had and was corrupted by Snoke's teachings to the dark side, becoming Kylo Ren. He then destroyed the Jedi temple Skywalker had started, taking some of his other apprentices with him and killing the rest. Skywalker went to the cliff side outcrop and managed to regain his Force abilities, which were suppressed for years after he shut himself off the Force allowing him to sense his sister from across the galaxy.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> After restoring his connection to the Force, Skywalker came to realize that Rey had been right about her, the Resistance and Leia needing him. He went to find Rey in order to tell her that he was going back to the Resistance with her<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> but instead he found Rey talking with Kylo Ren through the Force due to a [[Force-bond]] that he previously was unable to detect. Witnessing them touching hands, Skywalker blew the roof off of the hut Rey was in before ordering her to leave the planet. An enraged Rey proceeded to battle Skywalker with her staff, only to be swiftly disarmed<ref name="Episode VIII" /> after stumbling over a stone,<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 4">''[[The Last Jedi Adaptation 4]]''</ref> leading to Rey threatening him with his father's lightsaber. She revealed that, according to Kylo, Skywalker had tried to murder him while he was asleep and defenseless simply because he was afraid of his strength in the Force, sparking a duel between mentor and student. Skywalker clarified that when he had arrived at the hut, he sensed the power and darkness within his nephew and, for a brief instant, did desire to kill him and activated his lightsaber on instinct. However the moment passed and left him filled with shame, for the look on his nephew's face was not one of darkness, but of a scared child, only for the boy to collapse the hut around them in self-defense.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

Rey told Skywalker that like when he confronted his father about the light side still within him, she sensed the goodness still within Kylo Ren. Skywalker disagreed, saying that it is no longer there. Unable to convince him otherwise, Rey secretly stole the texts to teach herself later and left the planet without him to confront Kylo.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> As Rey boarded the ''Millennium Falcon'', Skywalker saw R2 for the last time and told him to send his best to Threepio and that he would need to stay with Rey to make sure she got back to safety.<ref name="TLJ Junior novel">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: A Junior Novel]]''</ref> As Rey left Ahch-To, Luke realized the similarity between her departure and when Yoda and Obi-Wan insisted him to remain on Dagobah to complete his training rather than abandon to save his friends at Cloud City.<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 4" />

[[File:Luke listens to Yoda TLJ.png|thumb|right|300px|The spirit of Yoda communed with Skywalker, urging him to embrace failure as the greatest teacher.]]
The following night, Skywalker returned to the tree containing the Jedi texts with the intention of burning it to the ground. As he approached the tree, he was greeted by the spirit of Yoda,<ref name="Episode VIII" /> whom he had not seen in decades since he last saw him on Dagobah and Endor.<ref name="TLJ Junior novel" /> Skywalker affirmed his desire to burn the tree with the texts inside but then began to hesitate when he attempted to do so. Yoda instead proceeded to summon a bolt of lightning, setting the tree alight and while laughing, repelled Skywalker with the flames when he changed his mind and tried to save the texts. As the tree burned, the two masters sat next to each other and Yoda reminded Skywalker that he needed to heed his final instructions to him before Yoda's physical death on Dagobah, namely passing down what he had learned. Skywalker lamented over the loss of the texts, but Yoda slyly stated that although the texts held wisdom, 'page turners, they were not', and they did not contain anything Rey did not already have with her. Skywalker tried to explain that by failing Ben he felt that he a had failed the Jedi. Yoda admonished Skywalker for still "constantly looking to the horizon", like he had when first came to him many years ago on Dagobah. Yoda explained that 'failure is the greatest teacher' and that failure was an essential part of what he had implored Skywalker to pass on so many years before.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

[[File:Luke Duels Kylo Ren.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Skywalker confronted Ren by projecting his appearance on Crait, having never left Ahch-To.]]
Skywalker later appeared at the [[Crait outpost|Resistance base]] on [[Crait]] and greeted his sister for the first time in years, giving her Han's [[Han Solo's dice|gold dice]] to remember him by. Reconciling his failure to stop Ren and for not being there to prevent Han's death, Skywalker resolved to finally confront Ren to buy the Resistance time to escape. Before Skywalker went to confront his nephew, he wordlessly greeted his old friend C-3PO.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

Stepping outside, Skywalker was spotted and targeted by a barrage of cannon fire from multiple [[All Terrain MegaCaliber Six|AT-M6]] walkers, but when the fusillade came to a stop, Skywalker strolled out of the smoke completely unharmed. Ren, having witnessed the impossible feat, approached Skywalker on foot. Ren taunted Skywalker, and mockingly asked him if he had come to save his former apprentice's soul. But Skywalker knew that Ren was already lost, and acknowledged that he was not there to redeem him.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

Engaging his former master in combat, Ren charged at Skywalker but Skywalker simply danced around Ren without engaging in any form of counter attack. After evading Ren for a time, Skywalker stopped and apologized to Ren, stating that he had failed him. He also informed his former student that victory was not so certain as he believed; that the war was only beginning, and that the Jedi would continue through Rey. He then deactivated his lightsaber and offered to let Kylo strike him down, but warned him that doing so in anger would only cause him pain, just as killing Han had, and stated that in death, he would always be with his nephew.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

Ren ignored all these warnings and slashed Skywalker across the torso. Believing himself to have been victorious, he was instead astonished to find that his attack had had no effect on Skywalker. He walked over to his former master and tentatively ran him through, and discovered that Luke was not physically present; he was in fact still on Ahch-To, [[Force projection|projecting]] an illusion of himself through the Force.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> The illusion was tailored to have the maximum effect on Ren, as Luke portrayed himself as he had last appeared to his nephew before they came to blows. Likewise, he portrayed himself as wielding Anakin Skywalker's lightsaber, knowing that it would have more effect on Ren than if he had used his green blade.<ref name="Luke Blue Lightsaber">{{Cite web|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2018/01/10/why-did-luke-skywalker-use-a-blue-lightsaber-against-kylo-ren-in-star-wars-the-last-jedi|title=WHY DID LUKE SKYWALKER USE A BLUE LIGHTSABER IN STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI? |publisher=''IGN''|last=Prudom|first=Laura|date=January 10. 2018|accessdate=January 11, 2018}}</ref>

Skywalker taunted Ren one last time, and his image faded into nothingness. Light years away, Skywalker collapsed from the mental stress necessary to sustain such a lifelike illusion, which Ren realized meant that Luke would become one with the Force. As he sat down on the cliff where he first trained Rey, Luke beheld the twin suns of Ahch-To in their final descent towards the horizon.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Though unsure if it was real or just a memory, Skywalker heard the familiar and comforting voice of Obi-Wan Kenobi, urging him to let go, and so he did.<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> Silhouetted by the binary sunset on a horizon much like the one he gazed upon as a boy, realizing that he was to step into [[Netherworld of the Force|a larger world]],<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 6">''[[The Last Jedi Adaptation 6]]''</ref> Luke Skywalker&mdash;Jedi Master, ace pilot, galactic legend and son of the Chosen One&mdash;passed away, joining his father and old masters as one with the Force with a feeling of peace and purpose.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Luke Skywalker's final thoughts were that his adventure had ended in the same way it began: by the light of two suns.<ref name="TLJ Adaptation 6" />

[[File:LukeSkywalker-ANH.png|thumb|left|250px|Luke Skywalker was once a farm boy who longed for a more exciting life.]]
In his youth, Skywalker was often curious, impatient, looking ahead to the future with little regard for his present surroundings, and even a bit brash.<ref name="TLJ Junior novel" /> Like his father, he was impulsive, reckless, and often had little regard for his own personal safety.<ref name="Episode IV" /> Some time after the Battle of Yavin, he would confer with Nakari Kelen that he regretted his behavior before then, acknowledging he complained "about everything" because of his desire to escape from Tatooine.<ref name="HttJ" /> He also acknowledged his scarce talent at lying,<ref name="HttJ" /> a trait that many people could infer.<ref name="SW8" /> Despite these traits, Skywalker had a happy childhood anyway.<ref name="TLJ Junior novel" />

However, as his skills in the Force progressed and, especially after losing a hand to Darth Vader, Skywalker became more patient and seasoned, and was often seen as having wisdom beyond his years.<ref name="Episode VI" /><ref name="weapon-jedi" /> However, he still retained his idealistic viewpoint, willing to think the best of anyone,<ref name="HttJ" /> and believing that Vader was redeemable.<ref name="Episode VI" /> He was also unable to ignore those who needed help, sometimes to the point of endangering missions for the sake of saving someone else's life, as his father would throughout the Clone Wars.<ref name="Star Wars 1" /><ref name="HttJ" /> Even as a child, he had a strong sense of morality and a need to help others despite likely danger.<ref name="SW7" /> Skywalker shows consistently throughout the series his sense to protect those that he cares for and loves, for example risking going to the dark side to help his friends, and his love for his sister very nearly causing him to turn, if it were not for his love for his father.

[[File:Luke Skywalker TLJ.png|thumb|right|250px|In his later years, Skywalker lived in exile as a grief-ridden and embittered hermit.]]
After his nephew, Ben Solo, betrayed him and killed most of his apprentices, Luke became embittered as well as grief-ridden and chose to exile himself to the planet Ahch-To, where he would spend the rest of his life in with the intention of dying where the Jedi began to forever end the Jedi. He also became more cautious in teaching others of immense power due to Ben's betrayal, feeling finished with the Jedi Order,<ref name="TLJ Read-Along Storybook & CD>''[[The Last Jedi Read-Along Storybook and CD]]''</ref> as evidenced when he initially refused to train Rey and would later decide to abruptly end their lessons after seeing her starting to turn to the dark side. He also now believed that there was no hope for those who fell to the dark side, as shown when he openly expressed that he believed there was no hope for Kylo to return to the light.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

However, after Yoda's spirit encouraged him that Rey was the Jedi's hope, Luke finally realized his wrongs and chose to help the Resistance. Despite his lost faith in his nephew, Luke showed great remorse for failing to stop his fall to the dark side, and for himself ending up being the turning point in Ben's fall. In the end, Luke willingly sacrificed himself for the Jedi to be revived and the Resistance to live on. Luke passed away on Ahch-To shortly after, having made peace with his failures and having no regrets.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

==Powers and abilities==
===Lightsaber abilities===
{{Quote|I see you have constructed a new lightsaber. Your skills are complete.|Darth Vader to Luke Skywalker|Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi}}
[[File:Return of the jedi 4.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Skywalker was an accomplished duelist who triumphed over his father, Darth Vader.]]
Though he received little training, Luke Skywalker quickly became quite proficient in lightsaber [[Lightsaber combat|combat]]. Luke's initial training with the weapon of the Jedi was a brief session with Obi-Wan Kenobi and a training remote on the way to Alderaan,<ref name="Episode IV" /> when he learned the initial position and the four defensive postures.<ref name="weapon-jedi" /> Though his level proved inadequate during his first, but brief duel against Darth Vader on Cymoon 1,<ref name="SW2" /> his combat skills had improved for their duel on Bespin,<ref name="Episode V" /> and culminated with him besting the Sith Lord in combat during the Battle of Endor.<ref name="Episode VI" />

Skywalker had some skills in Form V, able to intercept blaster fire.<ref name="Episode IV" /><ref name="HttJ" /><ref name="Episode VI" /> During his [[Mission to Rodia (Luke Skywalker)|mission]] to Rodia, he tried his hand at [[Jar'Kai]] for the first time with his and Huulik's lightsaber. Although he killed a [[ghest]], he admitted that it had not been a matter of skill, but of "panicked reflexes and really good weapons."<ref name="HttJ" /> He received further training from the "Gamemaster", a servant of Grakkus the Hutt, who had learned the art of lightsaber combat. Forced to fight him and the Hutt's MagnaGuards, Skywalker improved his cursory abilities.<ref name="SW10" />

After a brief time of training with Yoda, Luke revealed himself to be a gifted duelist on Bespin. Skywalker engaged Vader in a fierce duel but was defeated, with the Dark Lord proving his superiority. Later, Skywalker showed his abilities in battle during the rescue of Han Solo, where a skirmish ensued in which the Jedi killed many guards aboard the execution skiff and Jabba's sail barge. Later, on board the second Death Star, Luke showed his improved abilities and was finally able to duel Vader on an even footing. However, his unwillingness to fight his own father partly held him back; but when Vader threatened to turn Leia to the dark side, an enraged Luke unleashed all of his raw ability, overwhelming and defeating the Sith Lord.<ref name="Episode VI" /> Unlike his father in the [[Battle of Coruscant|final duel]] against [[Dooku|Darth Tyranus]],<ref name="Episode III" /> Luke used little to no finesse or strategy.<ref name="Episode VI" />

Later in life, Luke showed even greater abilities in lightsaber combat. He easily disarmed an angry Rey with a metal stick and his projection managed to easily avoid every single one of Kylo Ren's attacks without needing to use his lightsaber to block, holding the latter off on the planet Crait long enough that the remaining members of the Resistance could escape.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

===Force powers===
{{Quote|The Force is strong with this one.|Darth Vader during the Battle of Yavin|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}
[[File:Luke Skywalker on Crait.png|thumb|right|300px|Skywalker had the power to project his image across the galaxy, albeit with fatal consequences.]]
Like his father, Skywalker possessed a powerful connection to the Force. Indeed, Darth Sidious believed that Skywalker was strong enough in the Force to destroy the Sith.<ref name="Episode V" /> However, most of what he learned was self-taught due to Kenobi's few days of mentorship before his demise, and later Yoda's one year of mentorship before he died of old age, and Kenobi's sporadic guidance from beyond the [[Netherworld of the Force]].<ref name="Episode IV" /><ref name="weapon-jedi" /><ref name="Star Wars 1" /><ref name="Episode V" />

After learning the basics of the Force, he quickly learned how to sense through it,<ref name="Episode IV" /> and took the habit of opening himself to the Force in hopes of learning more than Kenobi had told him, and becoming aware of his surroundings.<ref name="HttJ" /><ref name="Star Wars 1" /> In time, he would also learn to sense the presence of his father.<ref name="Episode VI" /> He was capable of seeing and hearing those who [[Force spirit|had become one]] with the Force.<ref name="Episode IV" /><ref name="Episode V" /><ref name="Episode VI" /> By using the Force during the Battle of Yavin, he managed to destroy the Death Star with a shot that many thought was impossible.<ref name="Episode IV" />

After obtaining Huulik's lightsaber and dismantling it to know his inner workings, Skywalker surmised on his own that the Force could be used to manipulate matter in the manner of telekinesis and managed to learn how to move small objects, such as a noodle or a fork.<ref name="HttJ" /> By the time of the Battle of Hoth, Skywalker had the ability to pull his lightsaber to his hands, though not without difficulty.<ref name="Episode V" /> Under Yoda's training, this ability was further developed, enabling him to levitate several objects at once while meditating.<ref name="Episode V" /> At the time of his exile some 30 years later, Luke demonstrated even stronger telekinesis such as when he caused Rey's hut to break into pieces around the two, prying an antenna from the roof of a hut and summoning it to himself in seconds and keeping himself suspended off the ground, both when stopping himself from hitting the ground hard when dueling Rey.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Skywalker eventually learned other uses, such as [[Force choke|choking]] enemies and doing [[mind trick]]s,<ref name="Episode VI" /> as well as performing [[Force jump|Force-enhanced jumps]].<ref name="SW9" /><ref name="Episode V" /><ref name="Episode VI" /> He also demonstrated the ability to have visions several times.<ref name="weapon-jedi" /><ref name="Episode V" />

Before his death, Luke displayed the ability of projection, sending a life-like image of himself across the galaxy to distract Kylo Ren and the First Order. However, the strain of sending and maintaining this projection proved to be fatal to Luke.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

===Other abilities===	
{{Quote|Luke is the best bush pilot in the Outer Rim Territories.|[[Biggs Darklighter]] boasts about Luke's piloting skills to [[Garven Dreis]].|Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope}}
[[File:Biggs reprise 07.png|thumb|left|300px|Skywalker, whose father was considered the best pilot in the galaxy, flew the X-wing starfighter that destroyed the Death Star.]]
Skywalker was acknowledged to be an expert pilot, being the person who was responsible for destroying the first Death Star and managing to evade Darth Vader himself (albeit with help from Han Solo).<ref name="Episode IV" /> He also managed to destroy an [[Interdictor vessel]] on his own while piloting the ''Desert Jewel'', although he acknowledged that R2-D2 saved him when the astromech droid made the ship jump into hyperspace in the nick of time.<ref name="HttJ" /> He was also able to pilot a Imperial Lambda-class T-4a shuttle with relative ease, outmaneuvering an [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor]] that was trying to get a lock on him.<ref name="SE1" /> In fact, Luke had a talent for tinkering and a passion for speed.<ref name="TLJ Junior novel" />

He was a native speaker of [[Galactic Basic]],<ref name="Episode IV" /> and although Skywalker could not understand [[Shyriiwook]], he had quickly learned how to read Chewbacca's moods by his tone and expression before the Battle of Yavin.<ref name="TPtSatFB" /> After many years, he also learned binary, being able to communicate with his R2 unit without any help from a protocol droid,<ref name="Episode VIII" /> which he did not when he was younger as a farm boy.<ref name="Episode IV" />

Luke was Adept in unarmed combat. Luke demonstrated his skill early on Cymoon 1 where he defeated a few stormtroopers by kicking and slamming them to the ground, shortly after Luke found himself being attacked by an entire mob full of alien thugs on Nar Shada. Skywalker defeated numerous of the attackers unarmed before igniting his lightsaber and startling the rest. Luke found himself in another similar situation on Horox III, where he defeated an entire cantina of alien thugs with the help of Aphra and her Wookiee bounty hunter. Skywalker knocked out the Commander Kanchar, a hulking cybernetic enhanced man with a single punch after outsmarting him. Luke implemented his unarmed skill into lightsaber combat defeating countless of foes throughout his journeys as seen at the battle of the Great pit of Carkoon also when dueling Vader.

==Equipment==
[[File:LukeROTJsaber-MR.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Skywalker built a new lightsaber after losing his father's weapon.]]
Luke Skywalker wielded at least two lightsabers during the [[Galactic Civil War]]. The first was his father's former weapon, that was retrieved and given to him by Obi-Wan Kenobi.<ref name="Episode IV" /> He wielded this weapon for three years before losing it, and the hand holding it, in a duel against Darth Vader on the cloud city on Bespin.<ref name="Episode V" /> After losing his father's lightsaber, Skywalker built himself a new weapon, with a green blade, that he used to rescue his friends from Jabba the Hutt and during his final duel with Darth Vader.<ref name="Episode VI" />

==Behind the scenes==
Luke Skywalker was portrayed by actor [[Mark Hamill]] in the films [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']], [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']], [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']], [[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']], [[Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VIII ''The Last Jedi'']] and the upcoming film ''[[Star Wars: Episode IX]]''.<ref name="Episode IX">{{SW|url=news/star-wars-episode-ix-cast-announced|text=''Star Wars'': Episode IX Cast Announced}}</ref> He was portrayed as an infant by [[Aidan Barton]] in [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]. In ''[[Episode IV: A New Hope Read-Along Storybook and CD]]'' he was voiced by [[Joshua Fardon]], who also voiced the character in the [[Return of the Jedi (radio)|radio dramatization]] of ''Return of the Jedi'', which is now considered part of the continuity of [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] and not [[canon]], save for those portions which matched the material presented in the film.

===Sequel trilogy===
{{Quote|If you look at any classic hero's myth that is actually worth its salt, at the beginning of the hero's journey, like with King Arthur, he pulls the sword from the stone and he's ascendant — he has setbacks but he unites all the kingdoms. But then if you keep reading, when it deals with the hero's life as they get into middle-age and beyond, it always starts to get into darker places. And there's a reason for that: It's because myths are not made to sell action figures; myths are made to reflect the most difficult transitions we go through in life.|[[Rian Johnson]] on Luke's characterization in ''The Last Jedi''|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-wars-rian-johnson-mark-hamill-talk-last-jedi-at-sxsw-1094048}}
Luke's minimal screentime in ''The Force Awakens'' was decided by screenwriter [[Michael Arndt]], who felt whenever the character entered his draft of the script, he would upstage Rey and the audience would cease caring about her. Ultimately, he, [[J.J. Abrams]] and [[Lawrence Kasdan]] agreed Luke would have to withdraw from the story and become a plot device instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/12/20/jj-abrams-answers-burning-question-about-r2-d2-star-wars-force-awakens|title=J.J.

"It was a way of having [him] be part of every scene, every moment, not just spiritually or thematically or narratively, but actually," Abrams said. "Having his voice in it made the read through a better experience for everyone."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/04/04/star-wars-force-awakens-jj-abrams-mark-hamill-table-read|title=J.J.

Hamill was initially concerned by how Luke was written in ''The Last Jedi''. "I got into trouble because… I was quoted as saying to [[Rian Johnson|Rian [Johnson]]] that I fundamentally disagree with everything you decided about Luke, and it was inartfully [sic] phrased. What I was, was surprised at how he saw Luke. And it took me a while to get around to his way of thinking, but once I was there it was a thrilling experience. I hope it will be for the audience too."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/starwars/2017/06/12/mark-hamill-on-disagreement-with-last-jedi-director-rian-johnson/|title=Mark Hamill Clarifies His "Disagreement" With The Last Jedi Director|work=ComicBook.com|date=2017-06-12|first=Joseph|last=Schmidt|accessdate=2017-12-18}}</ref> Johnson explained: "Honestly, that came out of what I felt was a necessity, because it came from where he was at the end of ''Episode VII, The Force Awakens''. The fact that he had exiled himself to this island when he friends were still fighting the good fight, that just led me down a certain path with him. I couldn’t really see any other alternative.";<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2017/12/star-wars-the-last-jedi-rian-johnson-ram-bergman-interview-spoilers-deleted-scenes-lucasfilm-plans-1202227741/|title=Rian Johnson & Ram Bergman Talk 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' Deleted Scenes And Finding Light In The Dark Of Episode VIII|publisher=deadline.com|last=Utichi|first=Joe|date=December 15, 2017}}</ref> "Knowing that Luke is a hero, knowing Luke from growing up, I know he must think he’s doing the right thing by taking himself out of the equation. And because he’s the last Jedi, by taking the Jedi out of the equation, by saying, ‘I’m taking the Jedi out of this fight,’ he must think that’s the best thing for the galaxy."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://collider.com/the-last-jedi-luke-lightsaber-scene-explained-rian-johnson/|title=‘The Last Jedi': Rian Johnson Explains the Film’s First Luke Scene|publisher=collider.com|last=Chitwood|first=Adam|date=December 19, 2017}}</ref> Hamill agreed that an old, comfortable Luke would have been too reminiscent of Obi-Wan, but his issue was that "'Jedis don't give up.'" Johnson added the back-and-forth to get Luke's character to make sense helped "made me really dig in and justify the choices I had made to bring Luke to where he was at. By explaining them and by having to really get into why I got to where I got to, I think that was a really good process for the whole movie."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2017/12/13/rian-johnson-mark-hamill-luke-skywalker-last-jedi/#z12GdcXywkqG|title=Mark Hamill and Rian Johnson on jaded Luke Skywalker in 'The Last Jedi'|work=Mashable|first=Proma|last=Khosla|date=2017-12-12|accessdate=2017-12-18}}</ref> To get into character, Hamill thought of the real life hopes and disappointments of [[Wikipedia:Baby boomers|his generation]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/26/mark-hamill-on-the-weirdly-tragic-trajectory-of-luke-skywalker|title=Mark Hamill on the Weirdly Tragic Trajectory of Luke Skywalker|publisher=IGN|last=Skrebels|first=Joe|date=June 26, 2018}}</ref>

Johnson deemed it best to conclude Luke's ''Last Jedi'' arc with him dying partly because, "honestly, thinking about the number of characters we have on our plate going into the [[Star Wars: Episode IX|next movie]] [...] it just vaguely seemed good to me that putting Luke in another realm could open possibilities for his possible involvement in the next one. As opposed to him just being another character that had to be juggled into the plot, if that makes sense." He was unconcerned that the audience might feel unable to cope with Luke's death so soon after Han's murder in ''The Force Awakens'', as Luke's passing was victorious and peaceful, not a violent defeat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/movies/rian-johnson-the-last-jedi/|title=Rian Johnson On The Secrets Of Luke, Snoke, And Weird Al In 'The Last Jedi'|work=Uproxx|date=2017-12-18|first=Mike|last=Ryan|accessdate=2017-12-18}}</ref> Hamill was particularly not keen on Luke dying, feeling he had to return a triumphant hero, but Johnson argued that "if Skywalker just came back like he did in the original trilogy, an optimistic fighter, he's just an older version of Rey. And Johnson needed someone to bounce up against Rey."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/rian-johnson-mark-hamill-reaction-luke-skywalker-storyline-the-last-jedi-2017-12?r=US&IR=T|title=Rian Johnson describes how Mark Hamill reacted to the Luke Skywalker storyline in 'The Last Jedi' — 'It wasn't the thing he wanted to necessarily hear'|work=Business Insider|first=Jason|last=Guerrasio|date=2017-12-19|accessdate=2017-12-20}}</ref> Hamill said his primary lesson from the experience was how, "At times, I'd say to Rian, 'We gotta think of what the audience wants,' "And he'd say, 'No, we've gotta think of what we want.'"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/features/star-wars-the-last-jedi-14-things-we-learned-w513392|title=14 Things We Learned About 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi'|work=Rolling Stone|first=Brian|last=Hiatt|date=2017-12-06|accessdate=2017-12-18}}</ref>

Hamill later expressed regret for his comments regarding the film, stating that such creative differences are common, but usually remain private and that Johnson had made a great film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/mark-hamill-regrets-criticizing-last-jedi-version-luke-skywalker-1070418|title=Mark Hamill Regrets Criticizing 'Last Jedi' Version of Luke Skywalker|first=Ryan|last=Parker|date=December 26, 2017|accessdate=December 26, 2017|publisher=Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> He later disclosed he had similarly disputed the way the character was written in ''Return of the Jedi'', revealing "I read [the script for] Jedi and thought, 'Wait a sec! I thought I was heading toward the struggle of heading to the Dark Side. I'm in black. I have a glove. I see a trend here.'"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/03/mark-hamill-on-skywalker-disagreements-fear-of-starring-in-a-new-star-wars-film/|title=Mark Hamill on Skywalker disagreements, fear of starring in a new Star Wars film|work=Ars Technica|date=2018-03-12|first=Sam|last=Machkovech|accessdate=2018-03-13}}</ref>

====Luke's childhood====
[[Star Wars (LINE Webtoon)|A Korean web comic]] features a short story of a young Luke Skywalker. According to the comic, when Skywalker was just 12 years old, he and his friend, Windy went off on their own through the Tatooine desert and wandered away from the moisture farms riding a dewback. The two encountered a sandstorm during their time outside and both lost consciousness. A [[krayt dragon]] was nearby when Skywalker woke up, but they were saved by the Jedi-in-exile, Obi-Wan Kenobi, meeting him for the first time after his adoption to Lars family. Skywalker asked him who he was, and Kenobi revealed that his name was Ben Kenobi and an old friend of his father. Soon after, Skywalker exhausted and with Windy, he returned safely to their homes, carried on a dewback.<ref name="SBTFA">[[Star Wars (LINE Webtoon)]]</ref>
