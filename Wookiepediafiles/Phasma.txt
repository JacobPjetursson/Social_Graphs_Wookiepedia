{{Quote|You really are a First Order commander through and through, Phasma. You threaten, and whine, and wail, but you never ''do'' anything.|First Order Agent Terex|Poe Dameron 11: The Gathering Storm, Part IV}}
'''Phasma''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|female]] [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtrooper]] [[captain]] of the [[First Order]]. She served as part of the unofficial commanding triumvirate for the First Order and their [[Starkiller Base]] operation, taking charge of the command of the First Order's stormtrooper [[soldier]]s. During the [[cold war]], which took place thirty [[Standard year|years]] after the [[Battle of Endor]], Phasma served alongside the [[Dark side of the Force|dark]] enforcer [[Kylo Ren]] and [[General]] [[Armitage Hux]] in their efforts against the [[Resistance]].

Under orders from the [[Supreme Leader]] of the First Order, [[Snoke]], the triumvirate searched for a [[galaxy]] map that would lead to the last of the [[Jedi]], [[Luke Skywalker]], on the [[planet]] [[Jakku]]. After the [[Attack on Tuanul|sacking]] of the village [[Tuanul]], Phasma and her stormtroopers [[death|killed]] the survivors under orders from Ren. Afterward, [[Finn|FN-2187]], one of her division's stormtroopers, had an awakening that led to him betraying the First Order, despite Phasma's efforts at reconditioning him. The First Order eventually decided on unleashing their Starkiller [[superweapon]], an [[Hosnian Cataclysm|event]] which led to the destruction of the [[Hosnian system]], where the [[New Republic]]'s capital was located, for which Phasma was present.

Before the First Order could fire the Starkiller again and destroy the Resistance, FN-2187, now with the Resistance as Finn, alongside the [[smuggler]]s [[Han Solo]] and [[Chewbacca]], infiltrated the base and took Phasma captive. Under the threat of death, the trio managed to have Phasma lower the Starkiller's [[planetary shield]] for the Resistance's [[Battle of Starkiller Base|assault effort]] on the superweapon. Although Phasma believed the Resistance would be destroyed by her stormtrooper [[legion]]s, the Resistance was ultimately successful in destroying the Starkiller Base. Phasma was left in the base's [[Garbage compactor|trash compactor]], though she managed to escape just before the base's destruction.

Phasma later ordered the death of Resistance members Finn and [[Rose Tico]], when they were caught after being betrayed by their [[slicer]] [[DJ]] while attempting to infiltrate the ''[[Supremacy]]'' to disable a tracker. Before the execution could be carried out, however, the ''Supremacy'' was left bisected after being rammed by the ''[[Raddus (MC85 Star Cruiser)|Raddus]]''. Though all three were left alive, Phasma found herself at a severe disadvantage without the support of the majority of her stormtroopers. Defeated in single combat, she cursed Finn before falling into the [[fire]] that was consuming the ''Supremacy''.

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Quote|We were attacked. By the Scyre. Mother and Father and all the rest&hellip;are gone.''"<br />"''But you stabbed me. My leg.''"<br />"''No, Keldo. The Scyre did that. They caught you on watch, and I threw you into the Nautilus. I saved your life. We are lucky that they've invited us to stay here, to live among them. All we have to do is fight for them and contribute. And then we can stay here, in the Nautilus. It will still be ours. What say you?|Phasma and Keldo|Phasma (novel)}}
Prior to joining the [[Scyre]] clan, Phasma and [[Sexes|her]] brother [[Keldo]] were part of a small and weak [[Unidentified clan|clan]] that resided directly around the [[Nautilus]] on the desolate [[planet]] [[Parnassos]]. Phasma and Keldo grew up having to defend the clan's territory from raiders of rival clans such as the Scyre and the [[Claw (clan)|Claw]]. One [[Standard day|day]] Phasma orchestrated the [[death]]s of her clan including her [[Phasma's father|father]] and [[Phasma's mother|mother]] in order to ensure both herself and Keldo survived while still being able to live in the Nautilus. In order to do this, she stabbed Keldo in the foot with a [[knife]] and pushed him into a [[cave]], thus disabling him, claiming that the clan was under attack and that she had saved his life. Shortly after, Phasma along with Keldo both pledged their allegiances to the Scyre by painting themselves with [[oracle salve]] made by their family. Due to Parnassos' harsh environment and lack of technological advancements, Phasma spent her days wearing protective gear and scavenging crashed [[starship]]s for weapons and supplies. Eventually she led a group of Scyre clan warriors and believed herself to be the strongest warrior on Parnassos.<ref name="Phasma" />
====Encountering the First Order====
{{Quote|I am Phasma, and I am the greatest warrior of Parnassos.|Phasma, to Brendol Hux|Phasma (novel)}}
[[File:Young Phasma on Parnassos.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Phasma witnessed the First Order ship crash on Parnassos]]
Everything changed, however, when Phasma observed [[Palpatine's yacht|a]] [[First Order]] starship crashing in the neighboring Claw clan [[Claw territory|territory]]. Covertly leading her Scyre warriors over the border into Claw territory, Phasma was brought face to face with [[First Order officer|First Order]] [[officer]] [[Brendol Hux]], flanked by three [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtroopers]] and a [[Color|black]] [[droid]].<ref name="Phasma" />

Hux introduced himself as an officer for the First Order, who had been on a mission to recruit the strongest warriors in [[the galaxy]] to the [[First Order military|First Order's military]] when his ship had been shot down by [[Parnassos' automated defense system]].<ref name="Phasma" />

Seizing her opportunity to get offworld, Phasma stepped forward and unmasked herself, introducing herself and offering to help Hux find his crashed ship.<ref name="Phasma" />

===Service to the First Order===
{{Quote|The First Order is ''not'' the Empire. We are purer. We have been through the ''crucible'' and emerged ''stronger''.|Phasma to [[Agent]] [[Terex]]|Poe Dameron 2: Black Squadron, Part II}}
Phasma became a stormtrooper [[captain]] of the First Order,<ref name="Episode VII" /> though her true [[Military rank|rank]] was higher than her title suggested.<ref name="TFAVD">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> She was a member of the unofficial commanding triumvirate, alongside the [[Dark side of the Force|dark]] enforcer [[Kylo Ren]] and [[General]] [[Armitage Hux]].<ref name="DB" /> Phasma was assigned to [[Starkiller Base]], where she oversaw training of the First Order military and the stormtrooper ranks, in particular. Phasma sought to have only the best [[soldier]]s don the First Order's [[First Order stormtrooper armor|stormtrooper armor]], and endeavored to keep [[politics]] out of the ranks to guard against a lack of effectiveness.<ref name="TFAVD" /> Phasma also believed that a stormtrooper's loyalty was to be first and foremost to the First Order, not to any individual or comrade.<ref name="BTA">''[[Before the Awakening]]''</ref>

Shortly after the events of [[Operation: Sabre Strike]], which saw the capture of the First Order colluder [[Senator]] [[Erudo Ro-Kiintor]] by members of the [[Resistance]], Phasma contacted [[Agent]] [[Terex]] aboard his [[corvette]] ''[[Carrion Spike]]'', assigning him a mission to track down [[pilot]] [[Poe Dameron]] and retrieve Ro-Kiintor's information. Appearing to Terex via [[hologram]], Phasma expressed her exasperation at the agent's predilection for keeping [[Alien|nonhumans]] as his personal [[Slavery|slaves]], and discussed Terex's mission with him once he dismissed his servants. She complimented Terex's sources, surprised that he knew the term "Starkiller", and threatened him not to fail his mission to find Dameron.<ref name="PD2">''[[Poe Dameron 2: Black Squadron, Part II]]''</ref> Terex's search [[Mission to Megalox Beta|led]] him to [[Megalox Beta]], where Dameron slipped through his grasp after escaping the [[Megalox]] [[prison]]. Phasma contacted him after learning the ''Carrion Spike'' had left the [[Megalox system]] with significant damage, and ordered the agent to return to First Order space for debriefing. Despite Phasma's threat of extreme disciplinary measures, Terex switched off her hologram and refused to report in.<ref name="PD6">''[[Poe Dameron 6: Lockdown, Part III]]''</ref> Phasma continued attempting to contact the rogue agent, demanding an [[after-action report]], but still Terex refused to obey and disabled the ship's communications, [[engine]]s and weapons systems.<ref name="PD8">''[[Poe Dameron 8: The Gathering Storm, Part I]]''</ref>

After Terex and his [[Ranc gang]] associates took over the ''Carrion Spike'', Terex told the disapproving [[Unidentified First Order corporal|First Order corporal]] that Phasma, [[Supreme Leader]] [[Snoke]], and Kylo Ren regarded him as a criminal but that he would prove them wrong by destroying the entire Resistance.<ref name="PD10">''[[Poe Dameron 10: The Gathering Storm, Part III]]''</ref> After Terex contacted her, Phasma objected to his actions and objected to his unfamiliar attire. Terex responded that he was wearing the [[armor]] of the [[Lord]]-General of the Ranc gang and that she knew that when she recruited him. Phasma then reminded Terex that he had been ordered to report to First Order Space to report for his failure to obtain the information from [[Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi|Grakkus]] the [[Hutt]]. She warned Terex that Ren had taken an interest in his "missteps."<ref name="PD11">''[[Poe Dameron 11: The Gathering Storm, Part IV]]''</ref>

Terex was undaunted and responded that he had once met [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], whom he described as a "terrifying magical strongman". Terex then briefed Phasma about his plan to trick Dameron into delivering a droid that was purportedly carrying crucial First Order intelligence to the [[Resistance base]]. Terex planned to track Dameron and the droid there and destroy the Resistance with his [[fleet]]. Phasma immediately objected to Terex's plan on the grounds that the Supreme Leader had forbidden any [[Cold war|open hostility]] between the First Order and any forces aligned with the [[New Republic]]. Terex retorted that he was not solely a First Order officer and that the Ranc gang answered solely to him. He vowed to do what Phasma, Hux, and Ren could not do.<ref name="PD11" />

Phasma responded that this "errant action" was the reason why Terex had not been given the status in the First Order which he believed he deserved. She warned him that the consequences of pursuing this action would be dire. Terex mocked her for doing nothing but making threats and boasted that his plan would hand them the Resistance. Terex told Phasma to go and polish [[Phasma's armor|her armor]] before terminating the transmission. Phasma tried to protest but the transmission was severed.<ref name="PD11" /> The First Order subsequently dispatched forces under [[Commander]] [[Malarus]] who [[Battle over a desert planet|destroyed]] Terex's flagship ''Carrion Spike'' and the Ranc gang fleet. Terex was then handed by Dameron to Malarus.<ref name="PD13">''[[Poe Dameron 13: The Gathering Storm, Part VI]]''</ref> As a result of his failure, Phasma had the operative given cybernetic control implants.

Some time later, Terex and Malarus managed to secure [[Lor San Tekka]]. Terex, having grown tired of the implants controlling him, temporarily disabled them and contacted Phasma via hologram in order to bargain for their removal.<ref name="PD23">''[[Poe Dameron 23: Legend Found, Part IV]]''</ref>

At some stage shortly before the outbreak of [[First Order–Resistance war|war]] between the First Order and the Resistance, Phasma was dispatched aboard the [[Star Destroyer]] ''[[Silencer]]'' to patrol a [[hyperspace]] transit point between the [[Core Worlds]] and the [[Unknown Regions]]. Phasma and the forces under her command were assigned to search for Resistance [[Spy|spies]] trying to travel to the Unknown Regions to spy on the First Order. During the mission, the ''Silencer'' encountered a group of adventurers who had fled the planet [[Jakku]] aboard the ship ''[[Sunstrider]]'', and Phasma attempted to capture the adventurers.<ref name="TFA Beginner Game">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens Beginner Game]]''</ref>
====Interest in Colossus====
{{Quote|When Major Vonreg and Commander Pyre first proposed the idea of collaborating with pirates, I was skeptical. Since then, you have done little to prove me wrong.|Phasma, to Kragan|The Triple Dark}}
[[File:Phasma & Vonreg.jpeg|thumb|250px|Phasma working with Major Vonreg.]]
When the First Order took a interest in taking control of the [[Colossus]] refueling station on [[Castilon]], Phasma, along with Major [[Elrik Vonreg]], arranged for [[Kragan Gorr]] and [[Kragan Gorr's pirate gang|her pirates]] to [[Attack on the Colossus|attack]] Colossus. The attack would test Colossus' defenses. Following the attack, Phasma and Vonreg spoke with Gorr about the attack.<ref name="Triple Dark">{{Resistance|The Triple Dark}}</ref>
====Training the FN Corps====
{{Quote|While I am entirely in support of unit cohesion, General, a stormtrooper's loyalty must be higher, as you know. It must be to the First Order, not to one's comrades.|Captain Phasma to General Armitage Hux, regarding FN-2187|Before the Awakening}}
[[File:Phasma FN Corps training.png|thumb|left|250px|Phasma personally oversaw the stormtrooper training of the FN Corps, including FN-2187.]]
Phasma herself oversaw the training of the stormtrooper [[Finn|FN-2187]] and his [[FN Corps]] [[squad]]mates, [[FN-2000]], [[FN-2003]], and [[FN-2199]]. After a training simulation, Phasma noted to Hux that FN-2187 and his class had the potential at becoming the best stormtroopers the First Order had ever produced. However, she also noted that FN-2187 was potentially too empathetic, despite having trained him and his class since their induction into the First Order, after he strayed from his objective to save FN-2003 prior to completing the simulation. Phasma later expressed these concerns to FN-2187 himself, ordering him to leave those who could potentially weaken the First Order behind, speaking of FN-2003.<ref name="BTA" />

After the previous training session, Phasma accelerated FN-2187 and his fellow [[cadet]]s' training sessions, at [[time]]s praising FN-2187 in front of many members of the First Order for his successes. However, Phasma once again reprimanded FN-2187 after watching his performance in a [[melee weapon]]s exercise, during which the cadet once again expressed sympathy for FN-2003. Following this, Phasma sent FN-2187 and his squadmates on their first deployment to an [[asteroid field]] in the [[Pressylla system]], giving them a short briefing in which she explained the cadets were to restore order. At the [[asteroid]]'s [[mining]] [[Pressy's Tumble refinery complex|facility]], collectively known as [[Pressy's Tumble]], Phasma stationed the cadets on guard duty. In the meantime, she gathered a group of stormtroopers with her and awaited to negotiate with the mining facility's [[miner]]s that were on [[Strike at Pressy's Tumble|strike]], whom had allegedly been riled up by infiltrating New Republic agents and had caused delays to the First Order's mining operations.<ref name="BTA" />
[[File:Phasma FN-2187.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Phasma reprimanding FN-2187 for showing sympathy to FN-2003]]
Once ready, Phasma called FN-2187 and the cadets to her, informing them that they would be accompanying her for the negotiations. However, immediately in response to the miner's requests, Phasma ordered FN-2187 and the rest of the cadets to open fire on the miners. FN-2187 did not fire his weapon, but the rest of the squad did so, killing all of the miners. Despite his hesitation, FN-2187 and the cadets were officially promoted to full-fledged stormtroopers, but Phasma remained disappointed in FN-2187's lack of fulfillment. Phasma decided to give FN-2187 one last chance to show his worth by choosing him to be deployed on the First Order's next mission to the [[Western Reaches]] planet of Jakku, hoping a real battle would show him what it meant to be a stormtrooper.<ref name="BTA" />

====Assault on Jakku====
{{Quote|Sir, the villagers.''"<br />"''Kill them all.|Phasma and Kylo Ren, concluding the assault on Tuanul|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}
[[File:Phasma Jakku village.png|thumb|left|250px|Phasma executes the surviving villagers of Tuanul after sacking the settlement.]]
Under orders from Snoke, Phasma prepared an [[Attack on Tuanul|assault]] on Jakku to be led by Ren. The dark enforcer was on the hunt for a [[galaxy]] [[Map to Skywalker|map]] that would lead to the location of the last [[Jedi]], [[Luke Skywalker]]. Skywalker had led the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]] in their [[Galactic Civil War|efforts]] to take down the [[Galactic Empire]] 30 [[Standard year|years]] prior, and destroying Skywalker was the Supreme Leader's goal in the First Order's conflict with the Resistance and, by extension, the New Republic.<ref name="Episode VII" /> Phasma was accompanied by at least 80 stormtroopers,<ref name="Novel">[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)|''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' novelization]]</ref> including FN-2187 and FN-2003, to the Jakku [[Sacred Villages|village]] of [[Tuanul]]. There, the First Order sought to find an ally of the Resistance, [[Lor San Tekka]], whom they believed had found the map to Skywalker.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Immediately after her stormtrooper forces touched down on the planet, a battle broke out between the First Order stormtroopers and the villagers. FN-2003, whom Phasma had commended on his latest mission to the Pressylla mining colony,<ref name="BTA" /> was killed during the assault by Dameron, which was witnessed first-hand by FN-2187.<ref name="Episode VII" /> After the villagers were rounded up by Phasma's forces and Dameron's [[T-70 X-wing starfighter|X-wing starfighter]] was disabled, San Tekka was brought before Kylo Ren and interrogated. San Tekka, however, did not give up the location of the map and was executed by Ren, and Dameron was instead taken as [[prisoner]]. When Phasma inquired what to do with the surviving villagers, Ren ordered her to kill them all. Under Phasma's command, the surviving villagers were killed, although FN-2187 refused to fire his weapon and his conscience was awoken by the event.<ref name="Episode VII" />

[[File:Phasma and Finn Finalizer.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Phasma confronts FN-2187 and commanded him to submit his blaster for inspection.]]
Before returning to their command ship, the [[Resurgent-class Star Destroyer|''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Finalizer]]'', Phasma and her forces searched the entire village for anything that could lead to the map under Ren's orders.<ref name="Novel" /> When nothing was found, her stormtroopers destroyed Dameron's [[X-wing starfighter|X-wing]] and returned to the ''Finalizer''. Once there, Phasma confronted FN-2187 and demanded he turn his [[blaster rifle]] in for inspection, as well as to report to her division for evaluation.<ref name="Episode VII" /> She also reprimanded the [[trooper]] for removing his helmet, which he had done so in order to vomit after witnessing the events on Jakku.<ref name="Novel" /> Phasma determined that FN-2187 ultimately needed to be reconditioned.<ref name="Episode VII" />

In the meantime, Ren used [[the Force]] to [[Mind probe (Force power)|probe]] Dameron's mind and discovered that the map to Skywalker had been hidden in Dameron's [[astromech droid]], [[BB-8]], which was back on Jakku. However, before FN-2187 could be reconditioned and further action could be taken by the First Order on the droid, the stormtrooper betrayed the First Order and helped the Resistance pilot escape. On the [[Bridge (starship)|bridge]] of the [[battlecruiser]], after FN-2187 and Dameron [[Escape from the Finalizer|escaped]], Ren determined FN-2187 had been responsible for Dameron's rescue, and Phasma noted that it had been the stormtrooper's first offense against the Order. Despite the First Order's efforts to pursue the treacherous stormtrooper and locate the droid, he [[Escape from Jakku|escaped]] from Jakku with the aid of a [[scavenger]] named [[Rey]] on board the [[light freighter]] known as the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''.<ref name="Episode VII" />

====Battle of Starkiller Base====
{{Quote|You can't be so stupid as to think this will be easy. My troops will storm this block and kill you all. Whatever you're planning, it won't work.|Phasma, to Finn, after disabling Starkiller Base's shields|Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)}}
[[File:Phasma patrols Starkiller.png|thumb|left|300px|Phasma patrols Starkiller Base moments before she is taken captive and forced to bring down the superweapon's planetary shield.]]
Following the initial failure to retrieve the droid from Jakku, Snoke approved Hux's recommendation of putting the Starkiller [[superweapon]] to use against the New Republic. Phasma, along with the might of the military force stationed on Starkiller base, gathered for a speech to be delivered by Hux prior to the weapon's activation. Phasma stood at attention behind Hux during his speech, in which the impassioned general commended the First Order on their success in building such a massive superweapon. Phasma, along with the rest of the present First Order, then witnessed the activation of the Starkiller Base for the first time as it fired its [[dark energy]] [[quintessence]] beams through hyperspace and reached halfway across the galaxy, successfully [[Hosnian Cataclysm|destroying]] the entire [[Hosnian system]], including the New Republic's [[capital]], [[Hosnian Prime]], the [[Galactic Senate (New Republic)|senate]], and a majority of its [[New Republic Defense Fleet|fleet]].<ref name="Episode VII" />

Afterward, the First Order received word that BB-8 was on [[Takodana]], inside the [[Maz Kanata's castle|castle]] of the [[pirate]] [[Maz Kanata]]. Kylo Ren led an [[Battle of Takodana|attack]] that, although failed to capture the droid, led to the capture of Rey, who also had knowledge of the map to Skywalker. This led FN-2187, who had renounced his designation and now went by "Finn," to seek a way to return to Starkiller Base and free his friend. Along with the famed [[smuggler]] [[Han Solo]] and the [[Wookiee]] [[Chewbacca]], Finn successfully infiltrated Starkiller Base and sought out Phasma to bring down the base's [[planetary shield]]. In addition to rescuing Rey, Finn and Solo sought to make way for a resistance [[Battle of Starkiller Base|attack]] on the First Order superweapon.<ref name="Episode VII" /> While Phasma diligently patrolled the areas of Starkiller Base under her command,<ref name="TFAVD" /> Chewbacca tackled the stormtrooper captain and brought her before Finn and Solo.<ref name="Episode VII" />

[[File:Phasma captured by main heroes.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Phasma is captured by the base's infiltrators.]]
Finn taunted Phasma during her capture, expressly telling her that he was now in command.<ref name="Episode VII" /> When ordered to lead the group to the shield control room, Phasma initially refused, but she was convinced by having Chewbacca threaten to crush her within her armor and Finn threaten to shoot her at close range.<ref name="Novel" /> As Phasma and the group made their way to the control room, the captain realized that Starkiller's [[architect]]s had never considered being infiltrated and had little security.<ref name="Junior Novel">[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: A Junior Novel|''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' A Junior Novel]] {{C|'''Excerpt, Chapter 18:''' ''"When the shields were fully powered down and the consoles had been blasted beyond repair, they dumped Phasma down a chute into the base's sewage. Finn felt sorry only for her armor."''}}</ref> Once at the shield [[Computer|console]], Phasma attempted one last time to thwart Finn's efforts by stating she needed a second officer to bring down the shield, a bluff which Solo called her on. When that failed,<ref name="Novel" /> Phasma reluctantly took down the shields with blasters raised at her head. She believed the group to be completely delusional, assuring them that her stormtroopers would kill them all and put a stop to their plans,<ref name="Episode VII" /> to which the captain was still oblivious.<ref name="Novel" />

[[File:Phasma_trash_compactor.png|thumb|left|250px|Phasma is thrown into a garbage compactor by Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Finn.]]
However, instead of killing Phasma, Solo asked Finn&mdash;who had worked in sanitation on the base as a cadet<ref name="BTA" />&mdash;if the base had a [[Garbage compactor|trash compactor]], to which Finn replied that it did.<ref name="Episode VII" /> Once the trio blasted the consoles in the room beyond repair, they dumped Phasma down a chute into Starkiller Base's sewage system.<ref name="Junior Novel" /> Ultimately, what Phasma assumed was impossible proved to be true; bringing down the planetary shields allowed the [[Resistance military|Resistance forces]] to attack Starkiller Base and&mdash;with extra help from the saboteurs&mdash;destroy its [[thermal oscillator]], crippling the superweapon and causing the icy planet that hosted it to collapse upon itself.<ref name="Episode VII" />

====Finding a scapegoat====
=====Escaping Starkiller Base=====
{{Quote|Now we complete our mission. To hunt and kill the traitor that allowed Starkiller Base to be destroyed&hellip;Lieutenant Sol Rivas.|Captain Phasma, lying to TN-3465|Captain Phasma, Part I}}
However, Phasma did not stay in her prison for long. Having managed to set herself free by using an anti-armor [[Cyrothoric acid|acidic]] compound to dissolve the door of the compactor,<ref name="TLJVD">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> she returned to the console she had used to lower the shields to erase all traces of her treason. Upon realizing that [[Lieutenant]] [[Sol Rivas]] had accessed the very same computer mere [[Standard minute|minutes]] before her, Phasma decided to frame him for treason. Spotting her scapegoat on [[Level Two]], the captain attempted to shoot him at a distance, but missed due to the many explosions throughout Starkiller Base.<ref name="Captain Phasma 1">''[[Captain Phasma, Part I]]''</ref>

While [[Hunt for Rivas|pursuing]] her quarry, Captain Phasma started recording notes on the final moments of Starkiller Base, rewriting history in her own favor. During the pursuit, she narrowly avoided falling into a chasm created by the disintegrating planet. Phasma followed Rivas to an auxiliary hangar but was unable to stop the lieutenant from escaping in a [[TIE/fo space superiority fighter]]. At the auxiliary hangar, Phasma enlisted the [[First Order TIE Fighter Pilot|TIE fighter pilot]] [[TN-3465]] and the [[BB-series|BB unit]] [[BB-K8]] in the pursuit of Rivas. The three escaped Starkiller Base on a [[TIE/sf space superiority fighter]] moments before the planet exploded from the stored stellar energy.<ref name="Captain Phasma 1" />

=====Landing on Luprora=====
{{Quote|He was here. He headed out on foot, but there's evidence of a fight here. A creature of some kind, not human.|Captain Phasma, discovering that Rivas had been taken prisoner by the R'ora|Captain Phasma, Part II}}
While TN-3465 flew the fighter, Phasma manned the starfighter's [[laser cannon]]s but was unable to shoot Rivas' fighter down since BB-K8 had not yet finished repairing the ship's weaponry. After kicking BB-K8 in frustration, Phasma ordered TN-3465 to keep a distance from Rivas. Shortly later, Rivas' TIE/fo fighter ran out of fuel and landed on the remote rocky, oceanic world of [[Luprora]]. After landing their TIE/sf fighter, Phasma and her team tracked down Rivas' stolen fighter only to discover that he had been captured by some unknown lifeforms. As a precaution, Phasma also disabled Rivas' fighter's communications, navigation, and distress beacon to prevent him calling for help.<ref name="Captain Phasma 2">''[[Captain Phasma, Part II]]''</ref>

Phasma and TN-3465 discovered an abandoned dwelling where they changed into civilian clothes. While TN-3465 adopted the nickname "Pilot", Phasma donned a helmet and called herself "Captain." After spotting a [[Lupr'or Village|nearby village]] with her [[Phasma's blaster rifle|blaster rifle]] gunsight, the three waded through a lake. However, the group were attacked by a [[Tsw'ells]], a giant tentacled monster. The creature dragged Phasma underwater with its tentacles but the captain was able to kill it with a knife. The trio were then greeted by members of a [[humanoid]] [[species]] called the [[Lupr'or]].<ref name="Captain Phasma 2" />

Phasma was able to understand the locals, who spoke a variation of [[Lupre'en]]. The First Order visitors were brought before [[Jair'i]], the leader of the Lupr'or peoples, who was impressed by Phasma's valor against the Tsw'ells. Form Jair'i, Phasma learnt that the Lupr'or were the descendants of offworld migrants who shunned technology in favor of a primitive lifestyle based on farming and fishing. However, they had lost most of their lands due to rising sea levels and a deteriorating climate. The Lupr'or lived in terror from the Tsw'ells and an aquatic people known as the [[R'ora]].<ref name="Captain Phasma 2" />

Jair'i also told Phasma and her team that Rivas had been taken captive by the R'ora. However, Phasma was unwilling to abandon her mission of eliminating Rivas. In response, Jair'i sent his guide [[Dar'en]] to show Phasma and TN-3465 the [[R'ora stronghold]] in an attempt to convince them of the impossibility of their mission. While examining the site, Phasma discovered that the water in the lake was less salty and learnt from Dar'en that the Tsw'ells slept at dawn. Despite the odds against them, Phasma was determined to continue with her mission.<ref name="Captain Phasma 3">''[[Captain Phasma, Part III]]''</ref>

=====Mission impossible=====
{{Quote|I will lead you to victory. I have been sent here to lead you to this victory.''"<br>"''Ph'asma! Ph'asma! Ph'asma! Ph'asma!|Captain Phasma rallying the Lupr'or to attack the R'ora stronghold|Captain Phasma, Part III}}
Returning to the Lupr'or village, Phasma questioned a [[Ali'ane's great granddaughter|young Lupr'or girl]] about where she got her necklace. The girl brought Phasma, TN-3465, and Dar'en to her great-grandmother [[Ali'ane]], the oldest Lupr'or in the village. She told Phasma and her great granddaughter that the necklace came from an abandoned Lupr'or ship, which the Lupr'or regarded as forbidden and as a "soul killer." The girl agreed to show Phasma and her companions the way to the ship in return for not telling her great-grandmother.<ref name="Captain Phasma 3" />

Guided by the Lupr'or girl, Phasma along with TN-3465 and Dar'en climbed a high mountain to where a Lupr'or starship rested on the summit. In order to salvage the technology aboard, Phasma and her team returned to the village to recruit the villagers. Captain Phasma managed to impress the villagers by donning her armor and blaster rifle. She claimed that she had been sent to lead them to victory. Since the Lupr'or were facing extinction, she urged them to take up arms and use the technology their ancestors had built. Under her leadership, the villagers salvaged several generators from the abandoned ship.<ref name="Captain Phasma 3" />

While assembling the generators, Phasma briefed TN-3465 about her plan to kill the tsw'ells surrounding the R'ora stronghold by using generators to electrocute the water. Phasma told TN-3465 that the Lupr'or assault on the R'ora stronghold was a distraction that would allow them to hunt and eliminate Rivas. When TN-3465 complimented Phasma for her oratory skills, the captain responded that she was merely using them as cannon fodder.<ref name="Captain Phasma 3" />

=====Confronting Rivas=====
{{Quote|I can't confess! I didn't do anything... It was you. You lowered the shields. You're responsible for the destruction of Starkiller Base. Y-you can't pin this on me.|Sol Rivas confronting Captain Phasma for her malfeasance|Captain Phasma, Part IV}}
Three days later, Captain Phasma led the Lupr'or assault. After electrocuting the tsw'ells in the lake, Phasma, TN-3465 and the Lupr'or rowed across the lake. While climbing the cliffs beneath the R'ora stronghold, Phasma briefly experienced a flashback of climbing on Parnassos with [[Torben]], [[Frey]], and [[Siv]], causing her to mistakenly refer to TN-3465 as Siv. When TN-3465 asked who Siv was, Phasma said that she was someone who was no longer of concern to her and told TN-3465 to move faster.<ref name="Captain Phasma 3" />

At the top of the cliff, Phasma and TN-3465 looked down as the R'ora gathered to meet their assault. Phasma and TN-3465 plunged into battle with the R'ora but were quickly overwhelmed. Fortunately for them, the Lupr'or force joined the battle. While the two armies raged, Phasma and TN-3465 headed towards the tower at the middle of the R'ora stronghold. While Phasma went inside to confront Rivas, she told TN-3465 to keep watch over their exit. When TN-3465 asked about the battle, she reminded her that they were here for Rivas only.<ref name="Captain Phasma 3" />

Inside the tower, Phasma encountered a bruised Rivas, who had sustained a black eye and several scratches. He pretended to be overjoyed to see her and tried to get her to free him from his shackles. Phasma demanded that Rivas confess to having caused Starkiller Base's destruction. However, Rivas instead pointed out that she was the one who had lowered the shields, making her responsible for the superweapon's destruction. Rivas pleaded for Phasma to spare his life in return for keeping her secret. To cover up her malfeasance, Phasma instead executed Rivas with her blaster.<ref name="Captain Phasma 4">''[[Captain Phasma, Part IV]]''</ref>

However, Phasma's execution was witnessed by a horrified TN-3465. When Phasma resurfaced, TN-3465 claimed that she had been fighting a group of R'ora to keep their exit clear. When she tried to feign concern for the Lupr'or, Phasma dismissed her former allies as colonists who were trying to take Luprora from its indigenous population. She also argued that the Lupr'or were unsuitable to the planet's evolution and that their intervention had merely advanced the species' imminent extinction. With the sea levels rising, Phasma believed that the Lupr'or would be supplanted by the R'ora, who were more capable underwater.<ref name="Captain Phasma 4" />

=====Eliminating loose ends=====
{{Quote|All this time we've spent together, have you really learned nothing? I'm a survivor. No matter what the cost. Today the costs is loose ends.''"<br>"''What loose end? I'm not a loose end!|Phasma, before killing TN-3465|Captain Phasma, Part IV}}
Returning to their TIE/sf fighter, Phasma ordered TN-3465 to ready the ship. While watching the sea engulf the Lupr'or, she fired upon BB-K8 with her blaster, disintegrating the droid. Phasma then ordered a shocked TN-3465 to raise her hands and turn around. When TN-3465 feigned ignorance, Phasma countered that the younger woman had not realized that she was a survivor who was determined to eliminate all loose ends. TN-3465 said she no way of threatening her but Phasma was unconcerned and shot her through the chest with her blaster.<ref name="Captain Phasma 4" />

While laying TN-3465 down, Phasma reassured the dying pilot that she had given her a quick death but that one loose end was too many. Before traveling back to join the First Order fleet, Phasma filed a report claiming that she had delivered justice to Rivas for his alleged "[[treason]]". Phasma also alleged that TN-3465 and BB-K8 had perished during the course of the mission. Arriving aboard the ''Finalizer'', Phasma landed her TIE/sf fighter and reported to General Hux.<ref name="Captain Phasma 4" />

When Hux asked why she had ignored protocol, Phasma reassured him that her recorded notes from her journey were being downloaded from the fighter. Phasma then informed Hux that she had personally hunted down and eliminated the "traitor" Rivas for lowering Starkiller Base's shields. Satisfied, Hux allowed Phasma to return to her division following a full debrief. Unaware of Phasma's true loyalties and motivations, Hux remarked that even an exploding planet could not impede her devotion to the First Order. Phasma then observed the gathering [[First Order Navy]].<ref name="Captain Phasma 4" />

====Service aboard the ''Supremacy''====
{{Quote|You were always disobedient. Disrespectful. Your emotions make you weak.|Phasma, to Finn during their confrontation|Star Wars: The Last Jedi: Expanded Edition}}
[[File:Phasma's Eye.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Phasma stares hatefully at Finn seconds before her descent.]]
Phasma later commanded troopers aboard Snoke's [[command ship]], the ''[[Supremacy]]''. She stood in one of the [[hangar]]s as the ''Supremacy'' destroyed the Resistance [[Nebulon-C escort frigate|medical frigate]] ''[[Anodyne (Nebulon-C)|Anodyne]]'', during which she issued an order to her second in command, ordering him to maintain high alert.<ref name="Expanded Edition">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: Expanded Edition]]''</ref>

Later Phasma was notified by [[BB-9E]] that there was a suspicious group of individuals in a nearby section of the ship. She led a squad of stormtroopers and officers to the location of hacking, where Finn, [[Rose Tico]] and [[DJ]] were about to sabotage. She welcomed Finn back as she and the squad surrounded the rebels.<ref name="Episode VIII">[[Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VIII ''The Last Jedi'']]</ref>

Phasma held both Finn and Rose in the hangar bay of the ship, revealing to them that their accomplice DJ had traded information with the First Order that allowed the escaping [[shuttle]]s from the ''[[Raddus]]'' to be targeted and [[Attack on the Resistance fleet|destroyed]]. Phasma brought out [[First Order stormtrooper executioner|stormtrooper executioners]] believing that death by [[blaster]] was too painless. She was about to order their execution when the harbor bay suddenly exploded in light and fire, killing most of the personnel stationed in the hangar.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

During the aftermath of the ''Supremacy'' being split by [[Vice Admiral]] [[Amilyn Holdo]] sending the ''Raddus'' into hyperspace at the ship, Phasma recovered, marching through the flames with a squad of stormtroopers, blocking the two rebels' way to the [[Xi-class light shuttle|''Xi''-class light shuttle]]. But before they could open, suddenly, an [[First Order All Terrain Scout Transport|AT-ST]] piloted by BB-8 began opening fire on them. While her stormtroopers were preoccupied by the rogue walker, Phasma confronted Finn, calling him a "bug in the system". Finn attacked her with a [[Z6 riot control baton]], and after a short duel, Finn delivered a debilitating blow to Phasma's helmet, knocking her into a pit and rendering one of her [[eye]]s visible through the damaged helmet. Phasma glared at Finn and told him that he was "always scum", to which he proudly replied that he was "rebel scum", before the floor beneath her gave way, sending the captain plummeting into the burning remains of the ship's interior.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Phasma will do anything to survive.|[[Vi Moradi]], to Captain [[Cardinal]]|Phasma (novel)}}
[[File:Ruthless Tactics EaW.png|left|thumb|250px|Phasma was ruthless in executing her duties]]
Phasma was a [[human]] female<ref name="Phasma" /> who stood at 2.0 [[meter]]s tall.<ref name="DB" /> Phasma was outwardly fiercely loyal to the First Order and believed that a stormtrooper's loyalty was only to be given to the First Order as a whole, not to any group or individual. Phasma saw herself and her stormtrooper divisions as extensions of the will of Supreme Leader Snoke and looked down on sympathy in her ranks.<ref name="BTA" /> Phasma, privately, also believed that the meddling of politics ultimately led to ineffective ranks among the past [[stormtrooper]]s of the former Galactic Empire, and sought to ensure herself that only the best soldiers were worthy of joining the stormtrooper ranks.<ref name="TFAVD" /> She believed that the First Order was stronger than the Empire, and was proud of the crucible of tests she and her compatriots endured to achieve that strength. Phasma disapproved of Terex's indulgences, which included keeping alien slaves and drinking Wookiee-brewed [[brandy]] with [[Kessel]] [[spice]].<ref name="PD2" />

However, in spite of her outward loyalty to the First Order and to her unit, she in truth had zero loyalty to anyone except for herself, and her past was wrought with betraying anyone that placed trust in her, including her own family and clan.<ref name="Phasma" /> As such, she was perfectly willing to exploit her reputation as the "mother" of the Stormtrooper Corps of the First Order to ensure her own survival,<ref name="Captain Phasma 1" /> and she used her knowledge of memorizing all of the serial numbers of the stormtroopers under her direct command to know which ones she should eliminate in the future.<ref name="TFAVD" /><ref name="Phasma" />

Captain Cardinal even speculated before his disappearance that, once the First Order's aims differed from Phasma's own aims, she would not hesitate to betray the organization.<ref name="Phasma" /> This was best demonstrated with the destruction of Starkiller Base, where she proceeded to not only deactivate the Starkiller Base's shields before then&mdash;though she doubted the Resistance's chances of success<ref name="Episode VII" />&mdash;but also promptly proceeded to kill anyone who might have deduced her to be the one responsible,<ref name="Captain Phasma 4" /> and even framed another officer, Lieutenant Rivas, for the deed.<ref name="Captain Phasma 1" />

Captain Phasma was also a skilled orator who was able to manipulate the Lupr'or colonists on Luprora into attacking the aggressive indigenous R'ora species in order to fight for their survival as a species. In private, Phasma regarded her Lupr'or followers as cannon fodder who would enable her to distract the R'ora so that she could eliminate Rivas, whom the R'ora were holding captive.<ref name="Captain Phasma 3" /> Phasma also despised the Lupr'or as colonists who were trying to supplant the indigenous R'ora. She also believed that the Lupr'or were unsuitable to Luprora's evolution since they were unable to adapt to the rising sea levels unlike the aquatic R'ora.<ref name="Captain Phasma 4" />

Though Phasma tried to intimidate Lieutenant Rivas into making a false confession, Rivas was not intimidated and instead pointed out that she had lowered Starkiller Base's shields. He then goaded her into killing him by promising not to tell anyone. Caring only for herself, Phasma regarded the TIE fighter pilot TN-3465 and the BB unit BB-K8 as instruments during her campaign to hunt down and kill Rivas in order to hide her secret role in lowering Starkiller Base's defenses. After eliminating Rivas, Phasma eliminated TN-3465 and BB-K8 in order to eliminate any lose ends. By presenting herself as a diligent member of the First Order who had eliminated a traitor, Phasma was able to avoid arousing General Hux's suspicion. Unaware that Phasma was primarily a survivor, Hux wrongfully believed that Phasma was wholly committed to the First Order even in the midst of crises.<ref name="Captain Phasma 4" />

Kylo Ren noted that despite the fact Phasma usually sided with Hux, he was glad that she hadn't met her demise on Starkiller. He also noted that if the rumors about her being thrown into a trash compactor by [[saboteur]]s on Starkiller were true, a trash compactor would have never ended the career of a soldier of Phasma's stature.<ref name="TLJ Junior novel">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: A Junior Novel]]''</ref>

==Skills and abilities==
The captain considered herself a perfectionist and kept herself in peak physical shape. She routinely walked dozens of [[kilometer]]s while on patrol on Starkiller Base in any typical day and was an expert in combat, particularly with all First Order small arms. Phasma also always insisted on fighting alongside her stormtroopers on the forefront instead of remaining in the comfort that could have come with her elevated rank.<ref name="TFAVD" /> As well, Phasma took it upon herself to memorize all of the serial numbers of the stormtroopers under her direct command,<ref name="TFAVD" /> such as FN-2187.<ref name="Episode VII" /> Terex complimented her on always being accurate to a fault.<ref name="PD6" />

==Equipment==
{{Quote|Even a Wookiee can't crush First Order armor.|Phasma in response to threats from Chewbacca|Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)}}
[[File:CaptainPhasma.png|thumb|right|250px|Captain Phasma, in her chromium armor, carried a customized F-11D blaster rifle.]]
Phasma wore armor coated in [[chromium]] salvaged from [[Palpatine's yacht|a]] [[Naboo]] [[yacht]] once owned by the Galactic Empire's [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]]. Its polished finish helped reflect harmful [[radiation]] and was capable of deflecting weak blaster bolts but couldn't hold against a hit from a riot baton, although the chromium served primarily as a symbol of past power. Phasma also believed that stormtrooper armor provided anonymity to an individual's gender, paying little heed to the antiquated belief that female stormtroopers were something new.<ref name="TFAVD" />

Phasma also wore a traditional First Order command [[armorweave]] cape in black and red, the colors of the First Order. Her primary weapon, a [[Phasma's blaster rifle|personalised]] [[Sonn-Blas Corporation|Sonn-Blas]] [[F-11D blaster rifle|F-11D]] [[Phasma's blaster rifle|blaster rifle]], was also polished in chromium.<ref name="TFAVD" /> She was also known to wield a [[Phasma's baton|command staff]] and a [[SE-44C blaster pistol|sliver backup pistol]], again also with a chromium finish, which she used in her duel with Finn aboard the ''Supremacy''.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

For Phasma's role in ''The Last Jedi'', Christie and director [[Rian Johnson]] discussed the character, exchanging ideas.<ref name="Phasma's backstory">{{Cite web|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2017/07/29/star-wars-how-gwendoline-christie-and-rian-johnson-developed-captain-phasmas-backstory|title=STAR WARS: HOW GWENDOLINE CHRISTIE AND RIAN JOHNSON DEVELOPED CAPTAIN PHASMA'S BACKSTORY|first=Terri|last=Schwartz|work=IGN|date=August 12, 2015|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref> In fact, Phasma was originally meant to not be part of the film's story, as she was supposedly killed-off in ''The Force Awakens'', but [[Marvel Comics]]' comic book series ''[[Star Wars: Captain Phasma]]'' brought her back in order to use her in the film. Johnson originally wrote a line for Finn's battle with Phasma in which Phasma was to reveal that she spent three weeks in the Starkiller Base's trash bin, so Finn was to ask her how she ate, but the line was cut because it would have been impossible as the base exploded the same day in which Phasma was thrown into the garbage.<ref name="io9 Phasma">{{Cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/rian-johnson-almost-accidentally-killed-off-captain-pha-1821029761|title=Rian Johnson Almost Accidentally Killed Off Captain Phasma in ''The Last Jedi''|first=Germain|last=Lussier|work=i09|date=June 12, 2017}}</ref>

The duel between Phasma and Finn was to have ended differently: Finn ended up revealing in front of her surviving stormtrooper escort that Phasma "squealed like a [[whoop hog]]" about the base defenses for Starkiller Base, thus making her responsible for the base's destruction. The stormtroopers then tried to attack her when confronted with evidence of her treason, only for her to kill them, while Finn capitalized on the distraction by [[Dismemberment|cutting]] her hand off. Phasma would have met her end when Finn blasted her with one of the stormtroopers blasters after the "scum" exchange between the two.<ref name="Deleted Scene">{{SW|url=video/phasmas-end-deleted-scene-star-wars-the-last-jedi|text=Phasma's End - Deleted Scene <nowiki>|</nowiki> Star Wars: The Last Jedi|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6xy0ZdvSt}}</ref>

[[Daisy Ridley]] suggested the idea of Phasma's eye being exposed by her fight with Finn in the film, and Johnson agreed, feeling it would be disturbing to show that someone as cruel as Phasma was actually physically beautiful. Costume designer Michael Kaplan originally wanted to take off Phasma's entire helmet, but Johnson insisted to only show Phasma's eye, stating that Phasma's face was showing too much, needing to be mysterious.<ref name="Art Last Jedi">''[[The Art of Star Wars: The Last Jedi]]''</ref> In addition, Johnson, Kaplan, [[Mark Hamill]], and Christie implied the possibility that Phasma might have survived her duel with Finn and could return in [[Star Wars: Episode IX|''Star Wars'': Episode IX]], with Johnson jokingly adding that "Phasma is the Kenny from <em>South Park</em> of this series".<ref name="Phasma Survived?">{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/12/17/star-wars-last-jedi-spoilers-captain-phasma-killed-survive/2/|title=The Last Jedi spoiler talk: The filmmakers discuss Captain Phasma's ruthless battle|work=Entertainment Weekly|first=Anthony|last=Breznican|date=2017-12-17|accessdate=2017-12-18}}</ref> However, more recently, Christie has begun to worry about not being able to explore Phasma's backstory in the ninth installment given the strong possibility that Phasma will not return.<ref name="Phasma Cinemablend">{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2304111/one-star-wars-actor-is-worried-their-character-wont-return|title=One Star Wars Actor Is Worried Their Character Won't Return|work=Cinemablend|first=Nick|last=Evans|date=2018-01-30|accessdate=2018-01-30}}</ref> The casting list for Episode IX released on [[July 27]], [[2018]] doesn't report Christie as returning.<ref name="Phasma Out?">{{SW|url=news/https://star-wars-episode-ix-cast-announced|text=''Star Wars: Episode IX'' Cast Announced}}</ref>
