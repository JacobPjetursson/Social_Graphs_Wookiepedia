{{Quote|I'll take on any job... for the right price.|Cad Bane|Evil Plans}}
'''Cad Bane''' was a [[Duros]] [[Sexes|male]] [[bounty hunter]] in [[the galaxy]] during the [[Clone Wars]]. He was considered the leading bounty hunter in the galaxy due to the [[death]] of [[Jango Fett]] at the [[Battle of Geonosis]]. He specialized in fighting [[Jedi]].

==Biography==
===Early Life===
[[File:Maul meets Bane.jpg|thumb|Bane meets with Darth Maul|left|257x257px]]
At some point prior to the [[Battle of Naboo|Battle]] of [[Naboo]], Cad Bane met the [[Sith]] [[Sith Lord|Lord]], [[Maul|Darth Maul]] on [[Nar Shaddaa]]. [[Sexes|He]], along with fellow [[bounty hunter]]s, [[Aurra Sing]], [[Troo-tril-tek]] and [[Vorhdeilo]] then assisted Maul in acquiring [[Jedi]] [[Padawan]] [[Eldra Kaitis]] from [[Xev Xrexus]]'s [[Auction of Eldra Kaitis|auction]].<ref name="Darth Maul 2" /> During the auction, Bane and Vorhdeilo [[Death|killed]] several of [[Jee Kra]]'s crew aboard his [[Shekelesh-class freight gunship|''Shekelesh''-class freight gunship]]. Bane, along with Maul, Sing and Vorhdeilo then met up with Kra and Kaitis at Kra's [[gunship]]. Bane [[pilot]]ed Kra's [[Starship|ship]] after Maul subdued Kra's men. Bane and Sing then discussed about possibly killing Maul.<ref name="DM,P3">''[[Darth Maul, Part III]]''</ref>

However their ship was sabotaged<ref name="DM,P3" /> and they were forced to crash-land on the [[Moon of Drazkel]]. Bane along with Maul, Kaitis, Sing and Vorhdeilo survived the crash. Bane then saw that Xrexus was making a sport and profit out of them. As Maul took Kaitis with him, Bane, Sing and Vorhdeilo then prepared to fight Xrexus' clients. Bane fought several [[Trandoshan]]s along side Vorhdeilo and Sing.<ref name="DM, P4">''[[Darth Maul, Part IV]]''</ref> Bane, Sing, and Vorhdeilo then stole a ship from the [[Ohnaka Gang]] after he took the last of the Trandoshans. Bane and the others then picked up Maul and left him to take out Xrexus at her [[Xev's hideout|hideout]].<ref name="DM,P5">''[[Darth Maul, Part V]]''</ref>

===The Clone Wars===
{{Quote|Cad Bane, who needs no introduction.|Count Dooku, introducing Bane|The Box}}
Bane became one of the leading [[bounty]] hunters during the [[Clone Wars]] after the [[Battle of Geonosis|demise]] of [[Jango Fett]] on [[Geonosis]]. Subsequently, Bane was hired by many of [[the galaxy]]'s highest bidders, including the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]]<ref name="Deception" /> and [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the [[Hutt]].<ref name="Evil Plans">{{TCW|Evil Plans}}</ref> Bane also acquired the [[Techno-service droid]], [[Todo 360]].<ref name="Holocron Heist" />

====Heist at the Jedi Temple====
[[File:Cad Bade Holocron FF.png|thumb|243x243px|Bane holds the stolen holocron]]
During the War, Bane was hired by [[Darth Sidious]] to [[Mission to the Jedi Temple|steal]] a [[holocron]] from the [[Holocron Vault]] in the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]] on [[Coruscant]]. Sidious provided Bane with a map of the [[Jedi temple]] and a security chip containing the temple's security systems. Bane then installed the chip into Todo. Bane also hired fellow bounty hunter, the [[Clawdite]] [[Cato Parasitti]] to assist him from the inside of the temple by posing as the deceased Jedi [[Ord Enisence]]. Bane successfully executed the heist.<ref name="Holocron Heist" />

====Skirmish over Devaron====
[[File:Cad-Bane-clonetrooper-SWCT.png|thumb|left|391x391px|Bane, disguised as a clone trooper]]
{{Quote|Welcome, Jedi. We've been expecting you!|Cad Bane to Anakin Skywalker and his team|Cargo of Doom}}
Cad Bane managed to escape Coruscant with the stolen [[Jedi holocron|holocron]]. [[Darth]] Sidious had [[Viceroy]] [[Nute Gunray]] send a small [[fleet]] of [[Munificent-class star frigate|''Munificent''-class star frigates]] to help Bane carry out his next assignment; To kidnap [[Jedi Master]] [[Bolla Ropal]] and have him combine the holocron and the [[Kyber memory crystal]], which was held by Ropal. Bane led a ground attack on the surface of [[Devaron]] and captured Ropal and the [[Kyber crystal]].<ref name="Cargo of Doom">{{TCW|Cargo of Doom}}</ref>

However, a [[Republic Navy|fleet]] of [[Venator-class Star Destroyer|Republic ships]], led by [[Anakin Skywalker]], came to Devaron and in the ensuing [[Battle of Devaron|battle]] most [[frigate]]s were destroyed, leaving only the [[Cad Bane's Munificent-class star frigate|frigate]] with Bane and Ropal onboard. Skywalker had his fleet destroy the [[hyperdrive]] of Bane's frigate, preventing him from going into [[hyperspace]]. Bane then attempted to force Ropal to open it by [[Torture|torturing]] him. However, Bane killed him with torture. Bane then came up with a plan to force Skywalker and [[Ahsoka Tano|his apprentice]] to open the holocron. Bane then arranged a ambush on the gun deck for Skywalker, Tano, [[Rex]] and their [[501st Legion|troops]].<ref name="Cargo of Doom" />

At first Bane and his [[droid]]s had the upper hand in the ambush. Bane however almost lost the [[crystal]] to Skywalker. When the [[gravity]] came back on, Bane retrieved the crystal and was able to lure Skywalker's apprentice away from the gunfight. Bane was then able to subdue Tano, took a piece of her [[Padawan braid]], and place her in front of a [[airlock]]. Bane was then confronted by Skywalker, who demanded his surrender.<ref name="Cargo of Doom" />

However, Bane threatened to kill Tano if Skywalker refused to combine the holocron and memory crystal. Skywalker thus complied. Bane was succesful and made his escape when he opened the airlock. Bane was then contacted by Gunray, who wanted Bane to transmit the crystal's information in exchange for his rescue. However, Bane refused and planned his own escape. Bane was then confronted by two clone troopers, [[Denal]] and [[Koho]].<ref name="Cargo of Doom" />

At first, Skywalker and the others saw that Denal shot Bane dead, but did not have [[time]] to retrieve the holocron. However, Skywalker could sense Bane,<ref name="Cargo of Doom" /> who faked his death and took Denal's [[Clone trooper armor|armor]]. One of the [[trooper]]s and Tano discovered his ruse when he they found his [[blood]] and saw that he was not a clone. Bane then knocked Tano out and then took a [[V-19 Torrent starfighter]] to [[Black Stall Station]].<ref name="Children of the Force">{{TCW|Children of the Force}}</ref>

====Kidnapping Force-sensitive Children====
{{Quote|Kidnapping innocent children? Seems like a small-time crime for the likes of you.|Cad Bane to Darth Sidious|Children of the Force}}
After obtaining the Holocron from the Jedi Temple, Darth Sidious tasked Bane to kidnap four [[Force-sensitive]] [[Youngling|children]] for a secret project on [[Mustafar]]. After kidnapping the [[Rodian]] child [[Wee Dunn]] from [[Rodia]] and the [[Nautolan]] child [[Zinn Toa]] from [[Glee Anselm]], Skywalker and Tano managed to arrest Bane as he [[Mission to Naboo|attempted]] to kidnap [[Roo-Roo Page]] from [[Jan-gwa city]] on [[Naboo]]. The two Jedi, along with Master [[Mace Windu]] and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] attempted to interrogate Bane, with little success aboard the ''[[Resolute]]''. Bane then [[Mission to Black Stall Station|took]] Windu, Kenobi, and [[CC-2224|Cody]] to his [[space station]] where he claimed that both the children and the Holocron were there; only the Holocron was present. However, Bane was able to have the Jedi trigger his traps and was able to make his escape.<ref name="Children of the Force" />

====Senate Hostage Crisis====
{{Quote|I'm in control. I make the rules now.|Cad Bane to Supreme Chancellor Palpatine|Hostage Crisis}}
Bane was then able to have Todo 360 rebuilt. Bane was later hired by Jabba the Hutt<ref name="Evil Plans" /> to free [[Ziro Desilijic Tiure|Ziro]] from the [[Galactic Republic|Republic's]] [[Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center|high-security prison]] on Coruscant.<ref name="Hostage Crisis">{{TCW|Hostage Crisis}}</ref>. Bane then started by having Todo and [[HELIOS-3E]] kidnap [[Senator]] [[Padmé Amidala]]'s [[protocol droid]], [[C-3PO]] and Skywalker's [[Astromech droid|astromech]], [[R2-D2]] in order to get blueprints for the [[Senate Building]]. After retrieving the knowledge, Bane then had the two droids [[Memory wipe|memories erased]] and returned to ensure his plans would not be discovered.<ref name="Evil Plans" />

Bane then went to [[Tatooine]], where both Jabba and the [[Grand Hutt Council|Hutt Council]] agreed that Bane would free Ziro before he could expose the [[Hutt Council records]] to the [[Galactic Senate|Republic Senate]].<ref name="Evil Plans" /> Bane, along with a team of bounty hunters that included Aurra Sing, [[Shahan Alama]], [[Robonino]], [[HELIOS-3D]], HELIOS-3E, a pair of [[BX-series droid commando|droid commandos]] and another [[IG-86 sentinel droid]] then went to Senate. As Bane distracted the [[Senate Guard]]s, Sing and the rest of the team then took out the guards with Bane strangling the last one. As the the two [[commando]] droids posed as Senate Guards, Bane and his team then went inside. There, Bane was able to kill the remaining Senate Guards as they went to ''speak'' with the senators. Bane then left Robonino to turn the power off.<ref name="Hostage Crisis" />

Bane then found a group of senators that were discussing the [[Enhanced privacy invasion bill]]. At first, Senator [[Philo]] refused to cooperate with Bane and his team. Bane then shot the Senator in the back and had his team threatened the other senators. Bane then contacted [[Supreme Chancellor|Chancellor]] Palpatine and demanded a pardon disk for Ziro. After the power was shut down, Bane and his team searched the Senators for communication devices and weapons, Bane then saw Amidala looking at Skywalker on the balcony. Bane then sent Alama and the IG-86 droid after Skywalker.<ref name="Hostage Crisis" />

Bane then contacted Palpatine and told him that HELIOS-3D would come and take Senator [[Orn Free Taa]] to the [[prison]] where Ziro would be released with the pardon disk. Bane was then told by Alama that Skywalker did not have [[Skywalker's lightsaber|his]] [[lightsaber]] with him. Bane then sent Sing with Alama to find Skywalker. Bane then had HELIOS-3D take Taa to the prison where Ziro was freed and returned to the Senate building to pick Bane and his team.<ref name="Hostage Crisis" />

After Skywalker was subdued, Bane then set up laser web to ensure that the Senators would not make a move against him. As Bane and his team left, Bane warned Palpatine not to do anything else that [[Standard day|day]] against him. As his team left, Bane was the confronted by [[Clone Commander|Commander]] [[CC-1010|Fox]] and his detachment of the [[Coruscant Guard]]. Bane was then contacted by Palpatine, who demanded that Bane stand down. However, Bane threatened to kill the senators if he was allowed to leave. Thus, Palpatine and Fox stood as Bane and his team rendezvoused with Ziro and HELIOS-3D. As Bane left, Ziro congratulated him on his job,<ref name="Hostage Crisis" /> despite knowing that Hutt council wanted just for the council records.<ref name="Hunt for Ziro" /> Bane then offered Ziro a room filled with dead senators as payback. Bane then reminded Ziro that it was time to pay up since he did not work for free.<ref name="Hostage Crisis" />

====Hunt For Ziro====
{{Quote|I'm kind of tired of being paid for this job, too. But not that tired.|Cad Bane to Gardulla the Hutt|Hunt for Ziro}}
Bane was once again hired by the Hutt crime families after Ziro escaped his prison on [[Nal Hutta]] with the help of singer [[Sy Snootles]]. Unbeknownst to Bane, the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and [[Quinlan Vos]] were also after Ziro, hoping to recapture Ziro. Bane eventually managed to track down Ziro to the [[planet]] [[Teth]] only to find him already dead, murdered by Snootles who had used him to find a [[holodiary]], recording the dealings of the Hutt families. After a brief [[Showdown on Teth|battle]], Bane once again managed to escape capture by the Jedi.<ref name="Hunt for Ziro" />

====Prison break on Coruscant====
{{Quote|It's not the first time I've broken out of this stinkhole.|Cad Bane to [[Moralo Eval]] and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Rako Hardeen]]|Deception}}
At a certain point during the war Bane was apprehended by the Republic for his crimes and imprisoned in the Central Detention Centre. However, he merely allowed himself to be captured as part of his latest job. He had been hired by [[Moralo Eval]], a criminal mastermind working for [[Count]] [[Dooku]], to break him out of prison. Eval was highly involved in a Separatist plan to kidnap Supreme Chancellor Palpatine was also planning on recruiting Bane in his plan. Not long thereafter Eval became interested in recruiting [[Rako Hardeen]], a bounty hunter, who was imprisoned for killing Obi-Wan Kenobi, after watching him fight with some of the inmates. Eval had Hardeen brought to his own cell to talk with him and introduced him to Bane, who had a strong dislike of Hardeen and was definitely not in for breaking Hardeen out as well and Eval had Hardeen brought back to his cell. Both Bane and Eval did not know that Hardeen was in fact Kenobi in disguise only there to learn about Eval's plan.<ref name="Deception" />

[[File:TheGreatEscape-D.jpg|right|thumb|330x330px|Cad Bane, Rako Hardeen and [[Moralo Eval]] in the prison hallways]]
Bane had paid fellow bounty hunter [[Boba Fett]], who was in the prison as well, to start a [[Riot at the Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center|riot]] as a diversion for him and Eval to escape. Fett was successful and Eval and Bane escaped in the ensuing chaos. Hardeen followed them into the hallways and although Bane was not in for it, he reluctantly let Hardeen come along as Eval thought he might be of use. Bane's plan was to escape the facility via the mortuary, but the lock of the mortuary doors had been changed and Bane was unable to open them. Hardeen, actually Kenobi, told his comrades to stand guard while he would figure it out and secretly [[Telekinesis|used]] [[the Force]] to open the lock. The three quickly climbed into the coffins meant to send the victims of the riot to the cremation centre. The [[Cloning|clones]] in the cremation centre found out that the people in the coffins were still alive. The trio quickly climbed out of the coffins. One of the clones tried to shoot Bane, who used another clone to shield himself from the blast, before disarming and killing the clone that shot with his own gun. Hardeen disarmed the third clone, but hesitated to kill him. The clone triggered the alarm before Bane executed him. Bane angrily asked Hardeen why he didn't take the shot, but Hardeen claimed that his [[blaster]] jammed. The trio proceeded to make their way to a landing platform with Bane shooting more guards in the process. They stole a [[Panther police interceptor|police speeder]] and used it to fly to the docks, where they stole a cargo ship from a [[Quarren]] pilot which they used to escape Coruscant. Once in the air Bane hit Hardeen in the face for hesitating to shoot the clone in the cremation centre. Eval, however, was most pleased that Hardeen had come along and considered to involve him in his plan again.<ref name="Deception" />

====Trouble on Nal Hutta====
{{Quote|Relax. On this slime pool everybody's an outlaw.| Cad Bane to his comrades while on [[Nal Hutta]]|Friends and Enemies}}
Following their escape from Coruscant, Bane, Hardeen and Eval then crashed their ship in the [[swamp]]s of Nal Hutta. Bane and the others then went to the [[Bilbousa Bazaar]]. There, they went to [[Pablo]]'s [[Pablo's pawnshop|Pawnshop]] to purchase equipment and a new [[hat]] for himself. Bane then threatened Pablo with a toothpick to silence him. Bane then sent Hardeen to get a new ship while he and Eval got weapons and supplies. Bane then decided to turn Hardeen over to [[Gardulla Besadii the Elder|Gardulla]] and her guards due to his mistrust of him.<ref name="Friends & Enemies">{{TCW|Friends and Enemies}}</ref>

However, as Eval and Bane leave, they were shot down by the guards' [[HH-87 Starhopper]]s. They then left the ship only to find Hardeen having a drink at the [[Bilbousa saloon/Canon|saloon]]. There, Bane and Eval were surprised to learn that he got another ship for them.<ref name="Friends & Enemies" />

====Tournament on Serenno====
{{Quote|So, what kind of friendly little contest you think the count's got planned?''"<br />"''I'd be surprised if we all survive.|Rako Hardeen and Cad Bane about the tournament on Serenno|The Box}}
[[File:EnterIfYouDare-TB.jpg|thumb|left|308x308px|Cad Bane and the other contestants prepare to enter "The Box"]]
Eval, Hardeen and Bane made it to [[Serenno]], where they met Count Dooku. Both Bane and Hardeen demanded their payment, but instead Dooku asked them to take part in a special bounty hunter tournament that could gain them a much larger payment. The two reluctantly accepted with Bane suspecting that it would be a deadly contest and that not all participants would survive. Bane then spotted the hat of fellow contestant [[Bulduga]] and asked the bounty hunter how he got it. Bulduga responded by drawing his [[blaster pistol]], but Bane was faster and shot Bulduga in the chest, killing him in front of his brother [[Onca]]. He then mockingly took Bulduga's hat and dropped his old hat on Bulduga's body. Shortly thereafter Dooku gathered the contestants for a briefing on the tournament.<ref name="The Box">{{TCW|The Box}}</ref>

Dooku introduced the other candidates: [[Kiera Swan]], [[Derrown]], [[Sixtat]], [[Jakoli]], [[Embo]], [[Twazzi]], Onca, [[Sinrich]] and [[Mantu]]. He then showed them "The [[Box]]", a floating cube like station that served as the tournament arena. He explained that five most skilled among the survivors would participate in a job that would pay very well, while any remaining survivors would be eliminated to protect this job. Eval proceeded to explain that The Box was designed by him to simulate some situations that might happen on the job and the bounty hunters had to hand in their weapons. They were then escorted to an [[Turbolift|elevator]] that led into The Box and the tournament started.<ref name="The Box" />

[[File:EnterTheBox-TB.png|right|thumb|311x311px|Bane and the others await the first challenge]]
The contestants found themselves in a room and Eval appeared on a screen to mention that the only rule during the contest was that there were no rules. Thereafter a hole in the floor opened, releasing lethal [[Dioxis]] [[gas]]. Platforms started to rise from the ground to escape the gas. Bane kicked Mantu off a platform to get on it. When the platforms started to rise too much towards the ceiling the group found themselves between getting crushed by the ceiling and a layer of Dioxis below them. Hardeen deduced that the way out of the room wasn't in the ceiling but was somewhere in the floor. Hardeen found out that there was a hole in the floor that led to a tunnel below the gasline and to another room. Bane and the others followed Hardeen's example and survived the first test without casualties.<ref name="The Box" />

The tunnel led to a second room where Eval appeared on screen again and commented that the second test unlike the first would result in some casualties. Suddenly columns with electrified blades started to shove in and out the walls. Onca and Swan ended up impaled on the blades and Sinrich was killed by Embo. Hardeen discovered a pattern in the way the columns shoved in and out and noticed it led to a hole in the ceiling of the room. He showed Bane his discovery who told him to go to the hole. Bane and the others followed Hardeen in his climb and made it to the shaft in the ceiling that led to a third room.<ref name="The Box" />

[[File:Task3RayShields-TB.png|left|thumb|308x308px|The group during the third challenge]]
In the next room the group once again received instructions from Eval who told them to pass through his [[ray shield]] to switch it off with a button that was positioned behind the shield. Eval revealed a tube in the middle of the room. The tube contained a [[Electrolytic serum|serum]] that allowed the user to pass through the shield unharmed. It was however toxic to all but one of them. The ray shield appeared and started to close in on the group. After a while the floor became ray shielded as well, killing Jakoli and forcing the rest on a platform in the centre of the room. When Derrown wanted to take the serum Bane protested, but Hardeen told him to let Derrown take the serum as he was a [[Parwan]] and his blood could take the serum. When the ray shield closed in more and more the platform became smaller and smaller and Mantu was killed by the shield. Derrown was, however, able to inject the serum in his blood, pass through the shield and successfully deactivate the shield in time, allowing the remaining contestants to proceed to the fourth and final challenge.<ref name="The Box" />

In the fourth room the group was positioned on a platform above a [[fire]]y pit. Eval appeared and informed them that this test was about sharpshooter skills. One of them had to hit a target that moved very fast across the back wall with a [[sniper rifle]]. Sixtat volunteered and hit the target twice. He missed the third however and as a result he fell into the flames. Hardeen then took the [[sniper]] rifle and made an attempt as well, successfully hitting the target three times. Although Hardeen completed the task Eval moved the platform to separate Hardeen from the others. Dooku had noticed that Hardeen had been the cause of success on every test and planned on putting Hardeen in charge of the mission rather than Eval. Eval wanted Hardeen to hit some more targets. Hardeen hit another four, but then the rifle was empty and Eval saw his chance to get rid of him. When he tried drop Hardeen in the flames, Bane used on of his [[Whipcord thrower|wrist cables]] to prevent Hardeen from falling. Eval was angry with this, but Bane told him that if he wanted to kill Hardeen he should do it like a man in a [[Hand-to-hand combat|fair fight]]. Dooku agreed and dropped Eval in the room to fight Hardeen face to face. Eval didn't play fair and used his remote control to activate a few traps in the room and sent in some [[probe droid]]s to kill Hardeen. Nevertheless, Hardeen was able to defeat Eval eventually and Dooku ordered Hardeen to finish Eval off. Hardeen, being Kenobi in disguise and a Jedi, refused to kill Eval to Dooku's disappointment. Dooku however congratulated the remaining bounty hunters for surviving the box and announced that the job was in fact to kidnap Chancellor Palpatine during the [[Festival of Light]] on Naboo. He also announced that Bane would lead the [[Skirmish in Theed|mission]].<ref name="The Box" />

====Kidnapping the Supreme Chancellor====
Bane, along with Dooku, Eval, and the other bounty hunters then met up in a [[hangar]] in [[Theed]]. Bane then assigned the bounty hunter their individual parts in the Chancellor's kidnapping. Before he and the other bounty hunters, Bane was warned by Dooku to keep an [[eye]] on Hardeen.<ref name="Crisis on Naboo">{{TCW|Crisis on Naboo}}</ref>

Bane then infiltrated the crowd near the Chancellor by posing as a [[Neimoidian]]. After Derrown destroyed the [[Deflector shield generator|shield generator]], Bane and Eval then took the Chancellor to the rendezvous point to meet up with Dooku. However, Dooku was not there and Hardeen tried to take the Chancellor. Hardeen then overpowered Bane and Eval in a fight. Bane and Eval were then arrested by Skywalker, Windu and Hardeen, who was revealed to be Kenobi. Bane then swore vengeance against Kenobi.<ref name="Crisis on Naboo" />

====Bombing the Jedi Temple====
Near the end of the Clone Wars, Bane supplied [[General]]s [[Grievous]], [[Kleeve]], and [[Captain]] [[Rackham Sear]] with [[Lord]] Sidious's layouts of the Jedi Temple.<ref name="Kanan 8">''[[Kanan 8: First Blood, Part II: The Towers of the Temple]]''</ref>

Initial development of the ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' TV series focused on presenting the conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Separatists, leaving no room for third-party villains, but as the storyline progressed, the need for a bounty hunter character emerged. Supervising director [[Dave Filoni]] and writer [[Henry Gilroy]] initially considered reusing the [[Gen'Dai]] bountry hunter [[Durge]] from the [[2003]] ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars]]'' cartoon,<ref name="old-db-bts">{{DB|character|cadbane|Cad Bane}}</ref> which is now under the [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] brand and thus non-[[canon]]ical.<ref>{{SW|url=news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page|text=The Legendary Star Wars Expanded Universe Turns a New Page|archivedate=20170723213245}}</ref> This idea was eventually scrapped and Bane was reimagined as an in-universe equivalent of classical Western characters, based on Lee Van Cleef's "Angel Eyes" from ''The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly''. During this research, Filoni came across early concept art of a gun-toting spacer wearing a hat in drafts of the original ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy.<ref name="old-db-bts" />

According to Dave Filoni, supervising director for ''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'', Bane's iconic toothpick was originally intended to be a cigarette, but the idea was dropped due to its negative and commercial-like message.<ref name="Season 4">[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars The Complete Season Four|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'': The Complete Season Four]]</ref>

Cad Bane was voiced by [[Corey Burton]], who also voices Ziro the Hutt and Count Dooku.

Before the cancellation of ''The Clone Wars'' TV series, Cad Bane was set to make an appearance during a four-episode arc starring him and Boba Fett. The two were going to team up for a "rescue mission" on Tatooine where [[Tusken Raider]]s had kidnapped a child. It would emphasize Boba's and Cad's relation to one another as Cad had known Jango. Cad Bane would also get new [[Clothing|clothes]] and a new ship called the ''[[Justifier]]''.<ref name="Untold Clone Wars Panel">{{SWYoutube|7yKM6RExLlI|The Untold Clone Wars Panel - Star Wars Celebration Anaheim 2015}}</ref> In a clip revealed during the Animated Origins and Unexpected Fates panel at [[Celebration Orlando]] in 2017, Cad Bane and other Bounty Hunters had ended an insurrection by Fett.
