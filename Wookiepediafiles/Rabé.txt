'''Rabé''' was a [[Sexes|female]] [[human]] who served as one of [[King|Queen]] [[Padmé Amidala|Amidala's]] [[Naboo Royal Handmaidens|handmaidens]] during the last [[Standard year|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic]]. During the [[Invasion of Naboo]], she accompanied the Queen to [[Tatooine]] and then [[Coruscant]], along with her colleagues [[Sabé]] and [[Eirtaé]].

==Biography==
===Invasion of Naboo===
Rabé was a [[human]] [[Sexes|female]] who served the [[Royal House of Naboo]] as a [[Naboo Royal Handmaidens|handmaiden]] during the reign of [[Queen]] [[Padmé Amidala]]. In the [[Standard year|year]] [[32 BBY]], the [[Trade Federation]] [[Invasion of Naboo|invaded]] the [[planet]] [[Naboo]] and successfully captured its [[capital]] [[Theed]]. Rabé and four other handmaidens were taken prisoner along with the queen; however, prior to their capture, Amidala switched places with [[Sabé]], another of the handmaidens who acted as her decoy.<ref name="TPM" />

After the disguised Sabé was brought before the Federation's [[Viceroy]] [[Nute Gunray]], Rabé and Amidala were part of a group of prisoners that were sent to be processed in [[Camp Four]]. While being escorted to the camp through the streets of Theed by a [[squad]] of [[B1 battle droid]]s, the group was rescued by [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], a pair of [[Jedi]] [[ambassador]]s who had been sent by the [[Galactic Republic]] to negotiate with the federation.

===Escape from Theed===
The freed prisoners and the liberators then made their way to the hangar of the [[Theed Royal Palace]], where the Jedi attempted to persuade the [[battle droid]]s on guard to let them leave peacefully. When the droids tried to arrest them, Kenobi and Jinn attacked the guards, allowing Rabé and the other handmaidens to hurry aboard the [[Naboo Royal Starship]]. Once the Jedi and a group of [[pilot]]s they had freed were also onboard, the [[starship]] took off and managed to slip through the Federation [[blockade]] above the planet, although it sustained damage to its [[hyperdrive]] in the process.<ref name="TPM" />

Once the starship was safely away from the blockade, Rabé and fellow handmaiden [[Eirtaé]] stood by the decoy Sabé in the ship's throne room as the supposed queen congratulated the [[astromech droid]] [[R2-D2]] for repairing their [[deflector shield generator]] during the escape. With the aim of eventually reaching the Republic capital [[Coruscant]], the royal starship was forced to stop first on the [[desert]] world of [[Tatooine]] to locate a new hyperdrive. Upon landing, Jinn, R2-D2, the still disguised Amidala and the [[Gungan]] [[Jar Jar Binks]] left the ship to travel to the nearby [[spaceport]] of [[Mos Espa]] while Rabé and the others remained behind.<ref name="TPM" />

===To Coruscant===

[[File:Amidala arrives on Coruscant.png|thumb|right|Rabé accompanied Amidala to Corsucant.|250px]]
While those aboard the ship waited for the return of the group in Mos Espa, they received a transmission from [[Governor]] [[Sio Bibble]] back on Naboo. Sabé viewed the transmission&mdash;which begged the queen to return and give into the Federation's demands&mdash;in the throne room with Rabé and Eirtaé at her side, after which Kenobi warned them the plea was a trap and told them not the reply. After several [[Standard day|days]], the group returned with the hyperdrive the ship needed and the young [[Slavery|slave]] boy [[Anakin Skywalker]], who Jinn was bringing with him to train as a Jedi. The ship then left Tatooine and successfully reached Coruscant, docking on a landing platform where Valorum and [[Senator]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]] awaited them.<ref name="TPM" />

[[File:Anakin and Rabe.png|thumb|left|Anakin Skywalker spoke with Rabé on Coruscant.|250px]]
Rabé and the other handmaidens then accompanied Sabé as she disembarked the ship and greeted Valorum, after which they boarded a [[EasyRide passenger airspeeder]] with Palpatine and departed. Skywalker later visited the queen's quarters to see Amidala, who he knew only as Padmé the handmaiden, and was greeted by Rabé at the door. As Amidala was preparing to address the [[Galactic Senate]] in her royal regalia, Rabé informed Skywalker that Padmé was not present, but was interrupted by Amidala who wanted to know who was visiting. After learning that it was Skywalker, who did not recognise her under her makeup, Amidala informed him that Padmé was on an errand, but wished him luck in his Jedi training.<ref name="TPM" />

===Before the Senate===
Rabé and Eirtaé then joined Amidala and [[Captain]] [[Quarsh Panaka]] in Palpatine's pod at the [[Senate Building]] as the queen addressed the Senate concerning the invasion of Naboo. After the address, Amidala called for a [[Vote of No Confidence]] in Valorum, and Rabé was later present in Amidala's quarters when Panaka rushed in with the senator to inform Amidala that Palpatine had been nominated as a candidate for Supreme Chancellor. Amidala congratulated him and then declared she would be returning to Naboo, leaving the room with the two handmaidens and Panaka.<ref name="TPM" />

[[File:Amidala reveals identity.png|thumb|right|Rabé was present when Amidala reveled her true identity.|250px]]
Rabé, Eirtaé, Sabé and the queen then greeted Jinn, Kenobi, Binks and Skywalker on the landing platform where the Royal Naboo Starship was parked and the group boarded together and departed for Naboo. During the journey, Rabé and Sabé stood by Amidala in the throne room as she came up with a plan of action with Panaka, Jinn and Binks. After landing on Naboo, Binks led the queen and her allies to the [[Gungan Sacred Place]] where she and her followers were brought before [[Boss]] [[Rugor Nass]]. Sabé, who was again disguised as queen, began asking for the aid of the Gungan people, but Amidala stepped forward from beside Rabé and revealed her true identity, begging the boss for aid in defeating the Federation and dropping to her knees. Rabé and the other humans present followed suit, after which Nass declared he would work with the queen to defeat the Trade Federation.<ref name="TPM" />

===The Battle of Naboo===
As the [[Gungan Grand Army]] prepared to distract the Federation's forces in a large battle, Rabé and the other handmaidens joined a group led by Amidala that used secret passages to infiltrate Theed. Rabé then remained with Panaka and a portion of his [[Royal Naboo Security Forces|security forces]] to create another distraction in Theed's streets while Amidala infiltrated the Royal Palace with the Jedi, some guards and a group of pilots.<ref name="TPM" />

[[File:Naboo confronted by Maul.png|thumb|left|Darth Maul confronted Rabé and her colleagues in the palace hangar.|250px]]
Rabé and Panaka's group then reunited with Amidala in the palace's hangar, where the pilots of [[Bravo Flight]] had successfully launched their [[N-1 starfighter]]s in order to combat the Federation's blockade above the planet. As the group approached the hangar exit, the doors opened to reveal the [[Sith apprentice]] [[Maul|Darth Maul]], whom Kenobi and Jinn engaged while the rest of the group split off to take the long route to the throne room, where Gurnay would be located. Before they could get far, a trio of [[Droideka]]s opened fire on them, forcing them into cover; however, the droids were swiftly destroyed by Skywalker, who had hidden in one of the remaining [[starfighter]]s.<ref name="TPM" />

===Capturing the Viceroy===
When droids again attacked the group in one of the palace's corridors, Rabé was forced to take cover behind a pillar while firing on them. Amidala and Panaka then split off with a small group of guards and used [[grappling hook]]s to asail the side of the palace in order to reach the throne room. Rabé and the others then managed to fight their way to the throne room and upon reaching it discovered that Amidala and the others had been captured by Gunray.<ref name="TPM" />

Sabé shouted to the viceroy and claimed to be the true queen, fooling him and causing him to send the majority of his troops after Sabé, Rabé and the others, who retreated. This allowed Amidala and Panaka to defeat the few battle droids left behind and capture Gunray. After Skywalker destroyed the [[Lucrehulk-class Battleship|droid control ship]] ''[[Vuutun Palaa]]'' above Naboo, the droid army fighting the Gungans were deactivated and so the Trade Federation was defeated across Naboo.<ref name="TPM" />

===Victory celebrations===
Some time after the end of the fighting, Rabé and the other handmaidens stood with Amidala and her allies as they watched Gunray escorted by Panaka and his security forces onto a [[CSS-1 Corellian Star Shuttle|Republic shuttle]] to be taken away to answer for his crimes. Palpatine, now Supreme Chancellor of the Senate, then disembarked the [[shuttle]] and congratulated Amidala.<ref name="TPM" />

[[File:Globe of Peace handover.png|thumb|right|Rabé attended the victory parade after the Battle of Naboo.|250px]]
Rabé was present in the [[Funeral Temple]] for the [[Funeral of Qui-Gon Jinn]], who had perished while fighting Darth Maul. Following the Jedi's cremation, the handmaiden participated in a huge parade through the streets of Theed to celebrate the victory against the Trade Federation. She stood on the steps of the palace with the queen, awaiting the arrival of a march of Gungans led by Nass. The queen the presented Nass with the [[Globe of Peace]] as recognition for the Gungan's part in defeating the Federation.<ref name="TPM" />

==Personality and traits==
Rabé had brown [[hair]], brown [[eye]]s and tan skin.<ref name="TPM" /> As a haidmaiden, she developed considerable patience and was responsible for working on the Queen's elaborate hairstyles, which could take many hours to complete. During such lengthy sessions, Rabé provided the Queen with counsel.<ref name="Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary, New Edition">''[[Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary, New Edition]]''</ref>
