'''EV-9D9 (Eve-Ninedenine)''', also referred to as simply as '''9D9''', was a [[Sexes|feminine]] [[MerenData]] [[EV-series supervisor droid/Canon|EV-series supervisor droid]] who, originally a peaceful, hardworking [[moisture vaporator]] [[Technician|mechanic]], had a programming defect that made her enjoy tormenting and dismembering other [[droid]]s. She was acquired by the [[Hutt]] [[crime lord]] [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure]], who made her chief of [[Jabba's Palace|his palace's]] Cyborg Operations after a reprogramming, where she oversaw its droid pool with the assistance of her [[smelter droid]] devotee, [[8D8]]. When [[Jedi Knight]] [[Luke Skywalker]] gifted Jabba [[R2-D2]] and [[C-3PO]] in [[4 ABY]], shortly before the [[Battle of Endor]], EV-9D9 assigned them positions in her master's droid pool and was deactivated sometime after his [[Death|demise]].

In the [[Standard year|year]] [[0 BBY]],<ref name="Chronology note">In ''[[Bounty Hunt]]'', the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star's]] [[superlaser]] is fully operational, and ''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' establishes that the events of ''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]'', and thus the completion of the [[superweapon]], take place in [[0 BBY]]. Since the Death Star was destroyed in the [[Battle of Yavin]] ([[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]), it can be assumed that the events in ''Bounty Hunt'' also take place in 0 BBY.</ref> [[261]], a rogue [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] [[astromech droid]], was captured and brought to Jabba's Palace, where he was forced to join its droid pool. However, the droid was able to escape, making EV-9D9 furious. When the [[Trandoshan]] [[bounty hunter]] [[Bossk]], working to retrieve the droid for the Empire, tracked it to the palace, the supervisor droid explained that 261 had escaped, claiming that he would soon learn some respect. Bossk later recovered the droid from a clan of [[Jawa]]s and brought it back to the Empire.<ref name="Bounty Hunt">''[[Bounty Hunt]]''</ref>

C-3PO, a [[protocol droid]], was made Jabba's new [[Translator|interpreter]], as his [[Jabba's interpreter|last one]] was disintegrated after it had angered him, and was fitted with a [[restraining bolt]] before being returned to the palace's main audience chamber, and R2-D2, an astromech droid, was forced to serve drinks aboard Jabba's [[sail barge]],<ref name="Return of the Jedi" /> the ''[[Khetanna]]''.<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" /> However, R2-D2 was actually tasked with infiltrating the palace's droid pool so that he could assist in the [[Rescue of Han Solo|rescue]] of [[Han Solo]] from the Hutt's clutches,<ref name="R2-D2">{{Databank|r2-d2|R2-D2|archivedate=20170804034750}}</ref> a mission that ultimately resulted in Jabba's [[Death|demise]],<ref name="Return of the Jedi" /> after which EV-9D9 was deactivated with the rest of the palace's droid pool.<ref name="Battlefront">''[[Star Wars Battlefront]]''</ref>

Originally peaceful and hardworking,<ref name="Beware the Power of the Dark Side!" /> EV-9D9 was corrupted by a programming flaw<ref name="Updated and Expanded" /> and some very nasty reprogramming.<ref name="Beware the Power of the Dark Side!" /> A malicious, sadistic, and psychotic mechanic murderer,<ref name="Complete Locations" /> she enjoyed tormenting and dismembering other droids,<ref name="EV-9D9" /> reveling<ref name="Complete Locations" /> in working them until they fell apart<ref name="Updated and Expanded" /> or their [[processor]]s blew<ref name="Complete Locations" /> and employing bizarre forms of droid torture to increase motivation. EV-9D9 relished her role as taskmaster of all the palace's droids<ref name="Updated and Expanded" /> and was quickly annoyed with the antics of C-3PO, cutting him off whenever she got the answers she wanted or when he started to stray from the question at hand. When R2-D2 started acting feistily towards her, EV-9D9 assigned him to her master's sail barge to teach him respect.<ref name="Return of the Jedi" />

A gangly [[Color|bronze]] and silver colored mechanical with feminine programming,<ref name="Return of the Jedi" /> EV-9D9 was missing various parts, lending her a [[Skeleton|skeletal]] appearance.<ref name="Beware the Power of the Dark Side!" /> Her manipulator [[Limb|arms]]<ref name="Updated and Expanded" /> and legs were motivated by exposed pistons, and both of her hands terminated in three multi-jointed digits.<ref name="Return of the Jedi" /> She stood at 1.9 [[meter]]s in height<ref name="EV-9D9" /> and had three yellow [[photoreceptor]]s,<ref name="Return of the Jedi" /> one of which she custom-fitted to allow herself to "see" droid pain. EV-9D9 had a degraded logic center<ref name="Updated and Expanded" /> and spoke with synthesized female voice that sounded as if it had been stolen from an elderly [[prison]] matron. As she spoke, her hinged [[Vocabulator|vocoder]] flapped up and down beneath her sharp metal chin,<ref name="Star Wars: Return of the Jedi">''[[Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (paperback novel)|Star Wars: Return of the Jedi]]''</ref> simulating the movement of a [[mouth]].<ref name="Return of the Jedi" />

==Equipment==
EV-9D9 performed her duties while sitting<ref name="Return of the Jedi" /> behind an ancient, rickety [[computer]] console<ref name="Star Wars: Return of the Jedi" /> in the palace's boiler room.<ref name="Complete Locations" />

==Behind the scenes==
{{Quote|Richard Marquand was playing EV-9D9 in that scene and was terrific. It's very easy acting with a piece of tin when it's got a voice like that coming out of it. He used to be an actor, so he knows what it feels like, all the tensions you feel being on a set with a camera pointed at you, how you need to be encouraged and praised. He's very gentle, which is nice.|[[Anthony Daniels]]|The Making of Return of the Jedi}}
