{{Quote|You've been a great apprentice, Obi-Wan, and you're a much wiser man than I am. I foresee you will become a great Jedi Knight.|Qui-Gon Jinn|Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace}}
'''Obi-Wan Kenobi''', later known as '''Ben Kenobi ''' during his exile, was a [[Force-sensitive]] [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] [[Jedi Master]] who served the [[Galactic Republic]]. He was a mentor and close friend to both [[Anakin Skywalker]] and his son, [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]], training them in the ways of [[the Force]].

Born on the [[planet]] [[Stewjon]], Kenobi became the [[Padawan]] learner of [[Jedi Master]] [[Qui-Gon Jinn]]. Kenobi then became the first [[Jedi]] in a [[millennium]] to defeat a [[Sith Lord]] when he defeated [[Maul|Darth Maul]] during the [[Battle of Naboo]]. During the battle, Jinn was mortally wounded by Maul, and perished in Kenobi's arms. At Jinn's behest, Kenobi took Anakin Skywalker to be his own Padawan, training him during the decade leading up to the [[Clone Wars]].

During the Clone Wars, Skywalker was made a [[Jedi Knight]] while Kenobi (as a result of his military successes in the Outer Rim) was granted the title of Master and named to the Jedi Council. The two Jedi fought alongside each other as [[Jedi General|generals]] many times. In the last days of the Clone Wars, Skywalker turned to the [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]], betraying the Jedi. Skywalker's new [[Sith Master]], [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]], used [[Order 66]] to [[Jedi Purge|destroy]] the [[Jedi Order]], though Kenobi survived and reunited with another survivor, [[Grand Master]] [[Yoda]]. Kenobi confronted Skywalker, who had now taken the name Darth Vader, on [[Mustafar]], and the two [[Duel on Mustafar|dueled]]. Kenobi emerged the victor, gravely wounding Vader and remorsefully leaving him for dead. However, as Palpatine established the [[Galactic Empire]] in place of the Galactic Republic, Vader was rehabilitated, though he was forced to rely on a [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] [[Vader's armor|suit]] for life support. Kenobi went into exile on [[Tatooine]], where he would watch over Vader's newborn son, Luke Skywalker, who he took to live with his aunt and uncle, [[Beru Whitesun Lars|Beru]] and [[Owen Lars]].

[[2 BBY|Seventeen years later]], he eventually confronted his old enemy Maul, who he again defeated in a [[Mission to Tatooine (Imperial Era)|brief duel]]. As the former Sith lay dying in Kenobi's arms, the two finally made peace, and Maul stated that Luke would avenge them both.

[[0 BBY|Two years after]] the death of Maul, Kenobi received a message via [[R2-D2]] from [[Leia Organa]] asking for help in the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance's]] [[Galactic Civil War|fight]] against the Empire. The [[droid]] contained the [[Death Star plans|plans]] to the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]], a [[battle station]] created by the Empire capable of destroying planets, and the plans needed to be taken to [[Bail Organa]] on [[Alderaan]]. After Luke Skywalker's aunt and uncle were killed by [[Imperial Military|Imperial forces]] searching for the plans, Skywalker agreed to join Kenobi on this mission and be trained as a Jedi. The pair were taken to Alderaan by [[Han Solo]], only for them to discover that the planet had been destroyed by the Death Star. Their ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', was captured by the Death Star's tractor beam, and Kenobi was confronted by Darth Vader. Vader and Kenobi dueled again, and Kenobi allowed Vader to kill him so that Luke and his companions could escape the Death Star.

In the following years, as Luke continued fighting for the Rebel Alliance, Kenobi continued to give him guidance as a [[Force spirit]], including directing Luke to the planet [[Dagobah]], where Luke received training from one of Obi-Wan's Masters, Yoda.

====Prior to the Invasion of Naboo====
{{Quote|You and Satine have a history.''"<br />"''An extended mission when I was younger. Master Qui-Gon and I spent a year on Mandalore protecting the duchess from insurgents who had threatened her world. They sent Bounty hunters after us. We were always on the run, living hand-to-mouth, never sure what the next day would bring.|Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi|The Mandalore Plot}}
[[File:DuchessSatine-SWE.jpg|thumb|200px|thumb|right|Satine Kryze.]]
Prior to the [[Invasion of Naboo]], Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon spent a year on the planet [[Mandalore]] protecting [[Duke|Duchess]] [[Satine Kryze]] from insurgents who were [[Mandalorian Civil War|threatening]] her world. [[Bounty hunter]]s were sent after them, forcing them to always be on the run and live hand to mouth, never knowing what the next day would bring them. During that time, they had an [[Skirmish on Draboon|incident]] with a swarm of [[venom-mite]]s on [[Draboon]], where Kenobi carried Kryze to safety, only to fall and drop the Duchess, who then acquired a scar. Obi-Wan fell in love with Satine during his stay on Mandalore, but despite his feelings toward her, he continued with his training and was reassigned. Kenobi regretted leaving her, but ultimately followed the [[Jedi Code]] he had sworn to live by.<ref name="Voyage of Temptation">{{TCW|Voyage of Temptation}}</ref>

At some point prior to [[32 BBY]], Jinn and Kenobi were operating in the vicinity of [[Flesh Mongers planet|a planet]] that served as a base of the [[Flesh Mongers]] pirate group, flying a pair of [[Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor| Delta-7 ''Aethersprite''-class light interceptors]]. The two received a message from the surface of the planet from Jedi Master Yoda, who was asking for assistance. Landing on the planet, Jinn and Kenobi discovered that Yoda had taken out the entire pirate gang in order to rescue a young Force-sensitive child, known as [[Lo (child)|Lo]], as the pirate had planned to sell him due to his abilities in the Force.<ref name="Star Wars 26">''[[Star Wars 26: Yoda's Secret War, Part I]]''</ref>

===Invasion of Naboo===
{{Quote|I have a bad feeling about this.''"<br />"''I don't sense anything.''"<br />"''It's not about the mission, Master. It's something elsewhere&hellip;elusive.|Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn|audio=BadFeelingAboutThis-TPM.ogg|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace}}
[[File:Padawan Kenobi.png|thumb|180px|thumb|left|Kenobi during the invasion of Naboo.]]
By the time Jinn considered Kenobi to be ready for his [[Jedi Trials|trials]], they were sent by [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Finis Valorum]] to negotiate with the [[Trade Federation]], who had set up a blockade around the planet of [[Naboo]]. However, negotiations did not take place as [[Viceroy]] [[Nute Gunray]] instead sent [[B1 battle droid]]s and [[droideka]]s to kill the two Jedi, but they escaped to Naboo's surface by stowing away on separate landing craft.

On Naboo, Kenobi found Jinn in the company of [[Gungan]] [[Jar Jar Binks]], who reluctantly led the two Jedi to [[Otoh Gunga]], where they met with the Gungan leader [[Boss]] [[Rugor Nass|Nass]]. Though unable to convince the Gungans to help the humans of Naboo, Jinn [[Mind trick|influenced]] Nass to give them a [[Gungan bongo submarine|transport]] to allow them to reach [[Theed]]. Piloting the transport through the planet's core, Kenobi, Jinn and Binks reached Theed only to discover that the Trade Federation had already taken control of the city. After rescuing [[Monarch of Naboo|Queen]] [[Padmé Amidala|Amidala]] and several others, the Jedi took Amidala off of Naboo in her [[Naboo Royal Starship|starship]] in an attempt to reach Coruscant with news of the invasion. During the escape, the [[Starship|ship's]] [[hyperdrive]] was damaged, which prevented them from going straight to Coruscant and forced them to land on [[Tatooine]] for repairs.<ref name="Episode I" />

[[File:NiceToMeetYouFutureMassMurderer-TPM.png|thumb|220px|thumb|right|Kenobi meets Anakin Skywalker.]]
After landing, Kenobi stayed behind on the ship, while Jinn, Amidala (disguised as a [[Naboo Royal Handmaidens|handmaiden]]), Binks and [[R2-D2]] went to look for a new hyperdrive unit. While looking for it, Jinn discovered [[Anakin Skywalker]], from whom he retrieved a blood sample and had the data sent to Kenobi on the ship. The Padawan, then, found that the boy's [[Midi-chlorian|midichlorian]] count was the highest of any Jedi. When Jinn arrived, accompanied by Skywalker, [[Darth]] [[Maul]]'s attack prompted them to escape to Coruscant at once.<ref name="Episode I" />

Upon their arrival on the planet, Jinn and Kenobi went directly to the [[Jedi High Council|Jedi Council]] to report on the mysterious attacker, whom Jinn believed to be a [[Sith Lord]]. After being briefed on what to do about their mysterious attacker, Jinn discussed about Skywalker with the Council, believing him to be the [[Chosen One]]. Nevertheless, the Council was determined that the boy not be trained. However, Jinn persevered, telling them that he would take the boy as his padawan, despite the Jedi Code's restrictions, but Kenobi insisted he was ready to take the trials, and his master agreed. Instead of discussing the matter further, [[Mace Windu]] sent the pair back to Naboo to protect the Queen and also as an attempt to lure out the mysterious assailant.<ref name="Episode I" />

[[File:Kenobi Maul clash.png|thumb|300px|left|Obi-Wan Kenobi fighting Darth Maul after his Master was impaled.]]
After returning to Naboo, Binks located the Gungans and Amidala, revealing herself to the true Queen, begged Boss Nass to provide assistance in fighting the droid armies of the Trade Federation. Boss Nass agreed to [[Battle of Naboo|fight]] the droids as a diversion, while the Queen's forces slipped into Theed and captured Gunray. However, they soon encountered Maul once again and engaged in a duel with him biding time for Amidala to reach the throne room. During the duel with Maul, Kenobi was separated from his master and forced to watch as Maul impaled Jinn with [[Darth Maul's double-bladed lightsaber|his]] [[double-bladed lightsaber]] so, when the opportunity arose, Kenobi retaliated in rage against the Sith. However, the [[Dathomirian]] gained the upper hand, knocking Kenobi into a nearby shaft where he was just barely able to grab onto a knob jutting out from the side before falling to his death. Maul used this opportunity to kick [[Obi-Wan Kenobi's first lightsaber|his]] lightsaber into the shaft. Despite his predicament, Kenobi was able to use his master's [[Qui-Gon Jinn's lightsaber|lightsaber]] to cut the Sith in half, whose severed body fell down the shaft, presumably [[Death|dead]]. Kenobi then ran to his master's side and promised a dying Jinn that he would train Skywalker.<ref name="Episode I" />

===Master of the Chosen One===
====The first years====
{{Dialogue|Yoda|Confer on you the level of Jedi Knight, the Council does. But agree with your taking this boy as your Padawan learner, I do not.|Kenobi|Qui-Gon believed in him.|Yoda|The Chosen One, the boy may be. Nevertheless, grave danger, I fear, in his training.|attr=Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi|audio=ObiWanKnighted-TPM.ogg|src=Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace}}
[[File:You will be a Jedi.png|thumb|300px|right|Kenobi and Skywalker at Jinn's funeral.]]
Following the end of the Battle of Naboo, Kenobi was promoted to the rank of [[Jedi Knight]] by the Council, with Yoda reluctantly accepting his decision to train Skywalker. Kenobi was later present during Jinn's [[Jedi funeral|funeral]], where he informed the boy that he would become a Jedi. Later on, Kenobi, alongside his new Padawan and several members of the Jedi Council, took part in a victory celebration in Theed.<ref name="Episode I" />

Sometime after that, Kenobi and Skywalker traveled to the planet [[Ilum]] so that Skywalker could build [[Anakin Skywalker's first lightsaber|his first lightsaber]];<ref name="AEYNTK">''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know]]''</ref> after its construction, Kenobi said to him "''Anakin, this weapon is your life.''"<ref name="Hostage Crisis">{{TCW|Hostage Crisis}}</ref><ref name="The Big Bang">{{TCW|The Big Bang}}</ref>

During one of their many adventures, Kenobi fell into a nest of [[gundark]]s, prompting Skywalker to rescue him.<ref name="Episode II">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]</ref>

Three years after the Battle of Naboo, Skywalker sought to impress his peers at the Jedi Temple. During a training session, he defeated a [[Jedi training droid|training droid]], which he had programmed to mimic the appearance of the Sith of Naboo. All the while Mace Windu, Kenobi and Supreme Chancellor [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]] watched—the latter of which was impressed.<ref name="OW&A 1">''[[Obi-Wan & Anakin, Part I]]''</ref> Sometime later, Skywalker struggled to learn the [[Taming beasts|skill of taming creatures]] when Kenobi told him that the Chancellor wanted to see him. The two arrived at [[Emperor's office|his office]], where Palpatine requested that Skywalker accompany him on an errand, declining Kenobi's company.<ref name="OW&A 2">''[[Obi-Wan & Anakin, Part II]]''</ref>

Upon Skywalker's return to the Jedi Temple, he confided in Kenobi that he wished to leave the Order, feeling uncomfortable at the prospect of his entire life being decided when he was only nine years old, and surrendered his [[lightsaber]] to his master. Though Kenobi took the weapon, he pleaded Skywalker to reconsider.<ref name="OW&A 4">''[[Obi-Wan & Anakin, Part IV]]''</ref>

====Mission to Carnelion IV====
{{Quote|The road lies before you, Anakin Skywalker. Will you walk it alone?''"<br />"''No, Master. As a Jedi. If you'll show me the way.|Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker|Obi-Wan & Anakin, Part V}}
[[File:Carnelion IV.jpg|thumb|left|236x236px|Obi-Wan traveled to Carnelion IV with his padawan Anakin Skywalker.]]
Before Skywalker could give his definite answer, at Yoda's behest, both student and master [[Mission to Carnelion IV|responded]] to a mysterious distress signal from the supposedly-dead world of [[Carnelion IV]] that specifically called for Jedi intercession. They began their journey to the coordinates, but their shuttle was damaged due to the planet's [[Atmosphere|atmospheric]] debris field and the two had to eject from the doomed vessel, landing below the [[Celadon Sea]]. Not too long afterwards, they came to be aware of there being life on the planet as a sky battle raged over them, and Kenobi returned his lightsaber to him so that he could defend himself. As one of the combatant airships began to fall, Skywalker and Kenobi saved its two-person crew by delaying the crash.<ref name="OW&A 1" />

The survivors, [[Kolara]] and Mother [[Pran]], were unaware of the distress signal and who the Jedi were.<ref name="OW&A 1" /> Kenobi was then able to use a mind trick on Pran to lower her weapons. However, they came under attack by the other airship. Kenobi then used his lightsaber to destroy the airship. Kenobi then stopped the pilot, [[Grecker]] from shooting at Skywalker, Pran and Kolara. After Skywalker destroyed their blasters, Kenobi then pulled their knives away. Kenobi reasoned with Greckeker, Kolara and Pran that they need to get to safety. As they made their way, they came across [[Corpse-leech]]es. Kenobi and Skywalker then drew their lightsabers and tried to use the force to connect with them to no avail. Kenobi and the others then boarded an airship.<ref name="OW&A 2" />

[[File:Corpse-leeches.png|thumb|280x280px|War on the planet Carnelion IV.]]
Kenobi then refused to accept to give them the location of the distress signal. He also told Grecker that Skywalker was not his son, but his Padawan at the dying request of his master. Kenobi and Grecker then defended the airship against the corpse-leeches. However, Pran and Kolara took Skywalker with them and abandoned the airship. Kenobi was then left behind on the airship as Pran destroyed it.<ref name="OW&A 3">''[[Obi-Wan & Anakin, Part III]]''</ref>

Kenobi and Grecker were then able to jump off the airship before it crashed. Kenobi was then able to use the force to make the creatures understand him. Kenobi then asked Grecker to tell him where Skywalker was taken to. Grecker told him that he did not know where the open were. Kenobi then decided to go after him with Grecker after getting air masks on. Kenobi and Grecker then found the location of the distress signal. They then came under attack by a creature. Grecker then fired a flare. Kenobi and Grecker then fought until a masked man came out and let them in. Kenobi was able to get inside before Grecker closed the door. The man, [[Sera (Carnelion IV)|Sera]], then showed Kenobi his collection of his world's remnants. Kenobi was then told that Sera was the one who sent the distress signal. He then told Kenobi about his collection of relics and how both the open and closed wanted him dead.<ref name="OW&A 4" />

Kenobi then learned about how Sera sent the signal and learned about both the Jedi and Sith. Kenobi and Sera then went to the roof to watch as Grecker's forces attacked his fortress. Despite Sera's pleas for Kenobi to kill them, Kenobi told her that the Jedi spare everyone. Kenobi then spoke with Grecker and convinced him to stop their attack. However, Mother Pran attacked with her machines. Kenobi was then saved by Skywalker. Kenobi then took Skywalker to the Sera's communication unit. There, Skywalker was able to send out a signal off-planet. Republic and Jedi forces arrived where they ended the conflict.<ref name="OW&A 5">''[[Obi-Wan & Anakin, Part V]]''</ref>

===Separatist Crisis===
====Protecting Senator Amidala====
{{Quote|You know, I don't like it when you do that!"<br />"Sorry Master. I forgot you don't like flying."<br />"I don't mind flying, but what you're doing is suicide!|Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker|Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones}}
[[File:Anakin Padme Reunite.png|thumb|left|335x335px|Kenobi and his Padawan are reunited with Padme Amidala.]]
Following an [[assassin]]ation [[Plot to assassinate Padmé Amidala|attempt]] on [[Senator]] Amidala on Coruscant and their return from [[Border dispute on Ansion|a border dispute]] on [[Ansion]], the Jedi Council sent—at the behest of Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine—Kenobi and Skywalker to protect the Senator from future attacks. Kenobi sensed his apprentice's anxiety and warned Skywalker of over-stepping their duties, only to be told later of Amidala's plan to use herself as a bait.<ref name="Episode II" />

That night, [[Zam Wesell]] attempted to kill the Senator with venomous [[Indoumodo kouhun|kouhun]], but her plot was foiled and Kenobi used her probe droid to go through the express ways and find Wesell. Assisted by Skywalker's arrival in a speeder, they pursued the bounty hunter together through Coruscant until her speeder crashed outside a nightclub. The Jedi followed her in, realizing she was a [[Clawdite|changeling]]; however, Kenobi soon found Wesell and cut her arm off with [[Obi-Wan Kenobi's second lightsaber|his]] lightsaber before she could shoot him. Before she could tell the Jedi who she was working for, Wesell was shot and killed by a toxic dart fired by [[Jango Fett]].<ref name="Episode II" />

[[File:Obiwanarchives.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Kenobi in the archives.]]
Subsequently, Kenobi and Skywalker were sent on separate missions by the Council—while Kenobi continued an investigation on Amidala's aggressors, Skywalker would protect her on Naboo. Despite thinking his [[Padawan/Canon|Padawan]] was not prepared for his first solo mission, he abided by Council's request. Kenobi, then, took the toxic dart to his friend [[Dexter Jettster]], who told him that it was a [[Kamino saberdart]]. Using Dex's information about [[Kamino]], Kenobi visited the [[Jedi Archives|Archives]], but he was unable to locate the system. When he asked [[Jocasta Nu]] about it, she surmised that the system must not exist since it was not in the archives. Unconvinced, Kenobi visited Master Yoda, who was teaching younglings, and the two agreed that someone had erased the files on Kamino from the Archives, and that Kenobi needed to visit the location of the lost planet.<ref name="Episode II" />

====Discovery of the Clone Army====
{{Quote|I have successfully made contact with the Prime Minister of Kamino. They are using a bounty hunter named Jango Fett to create a clone army.|Obi-Wan Kenobi to Mace Windu and Yoda, via [[hologram]]|Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones}}
[[File:Obi-Wan on Kamino.png|thumb|267x267px|left|Kenobi meeting with the Kaminoans.]]
Upon arriving on Kamino, Kenobi was greeted by the [[Kaminoan]] [[Taun We]] who told the Jedi that they had been expecting him. She took Obi-Wan to Prime Minister [[Lama Su]], who said [[Sifo-Dyas]] would have been proud of the army they had created in accordance with his request—to create a [[Grand Army of the Republic|clone army]] for the Republic. Kenobi was then shown the clones' prowess and growth, and was told that the original template was Jango Fett. After asking to meet Fett, Taun We took Kenobi to Fett's quarters, where the Jedi Knight asked the bounty hunter questions concerning any recent visits to Coruscant.<ref name="Episode II" />

[[File:Fight on Kamino.png|thumb|276x276px|right|Kenobi engaging Jango Fett on Kamino.]]
After their meeting, Jango and his clone son, [[Boba Fett]], attempted to flee Kamino in the bounty hunter's ship, ''[[Slave I]]''. Obi-Wan confronted Jango, and the two fought on the landing platform. At the end of the battle, Obi-Wan fell off the platform, and Jango believed he had fallen into the sea. However, Obi-Wan managed to catch hold of a bridge, and he returned to the platform to see ''Slave I'' taking off with just enough time for Obi-Wan to attach a homing beacon to Jango's hull.<ref name="Episode II" />

====Capture on Geonosis====
{{Quote|You must join me, Obi-Wan. And together, we will destroy the Sith!''"<br />"''I will never join you, Dooku.<br>"It may be difficult to secure your release.|Count Dooku and Obi-Wan Kenobi|Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones}}
[[File:Geonosian_containment_field.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Kenobi as prisoner on Geonosis.]]
Kenobi pursued the ''Slave I'' in his starfighter all the way to [[Geonosis]] and managed to survive Fett's attacks with [[seismic charge]]s. Tricking him into believing he had died, Kenobi managed to land on the planet, where he discovered a multitude of Trade Federation ships. Furthermore, he infiltrated and overheard [[Dooku|Count Dooku]] addressing the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist]] [[Separatist Council|Council]] and mentioning the attempts on Senator Amidala's life were at the request of Nute Gunray. Realizing the importance of his discoveries, Kenobi sent a message to Skywalker in Tatooine as his signal could not reach Coruscant on its own. Before he could end his message, however, Kenobi was captured by the Separatists and imprisoned. There, Dooku visited him; he revealed that the Republic was under the influence of a Sith Lord named Darth Sidious, and tried to convince Kenobi into join him to destroy the Sith together, but Kenobi refused.<ref name="Episode II" />

===The Clone Wars===
{{Quote|So it's General Kenobi who is leading this assault. He is known for his deceptive maneuvers.|Separatist commander TX-20, on the reputation of Obi-Wan|Innocents of Ryloth}}
====First Battle of Geonosis====
{{Quote|As you see, my Jedi powers are far beyond yours. Now, back down."<br>"I don't think so.|Obi-Wan Kenobi confronts Count Dooku in the hangar|Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones}}
Sentenced to execution in the [[Petranaki arena]], Kenobi was joined in the arena by Skywalker and Amidala who, in their attempt to rescue him, were also captured. Although they managed to mostly control the three creatures deployed to kill them—a [[Reek]], an [[Acklay]], and a [[Nexu]]—, they were saved by the arrival of a Jedi task force led by Windu to rescue the prisoners. The Jedi fought back against the overwhelming droid armies, but soon only a few survivors were left in the center of the arena, surrounded by droids. Just as they were about to be executed, the clone army arrived, led by Master Yoda. The clones fought back against the droids and rescued the Jedi and Amidala. Kenobi, then, boarded the same Republic [[Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry|LAAT/i]] transport as Skywalker and Amidala.

[[File:Sai.jpg|thumb|300x300px|right|Kenobi fighting Dooku on Geonosis.]]
Soon enough, they caught sight of Dooku, who was fleeing on his speeder. Despite Amidala's fall from the vehicle and Skywalker's pleas that they rescue her, Kenobi and Skywalker caught up with Dooku and dueled him, until they were both taken out of commission—Dooku wounded Kenobi and severed Skywalker's right arm at the elbow. Even though Yoda arrived to fight Dooku, the Count used the Force to cause the ceiling to cave in on Kenobi and Skywalker, forcing the Grand Master to focus on protecting them from the collapsing ceiling instead of stopping his old apprentice, giving Dooku the distraction he needed to escape.<ref name="Episode II" />

After the Jedi returned to Coruscant, Kenobi met with Mace Windu and Yoda in the Jedi Council room to discuss the [[Battle of Geonosis|confrontation]] that had just taken place. Although Kenobi noted that it would not have been a victory without the clones, Yoda did not think of it as victory, as it meant the beginning of the [[Clone Wars]].<ref name="Episode II" />

====Capturing a thief====
While visiting Dex's Diner, the [[Pa'lowick]] thief [[Tri Tellon]] stole an object from Kenobi. She escaped through [[CoCo Town]] and to her den, which she shared with the old rogue [[Magreda]]. Expecting to find Magreda, she instead found Kenobi who explained that the object she had stolen was just a tracking device wrapped in some paper. In came Dexter, who had asked Kenobi to trick Tellon as she had stolen a lot of goods from his customers. Dexter thanked him and told Kenobi he owed him one.<ref name="Stop, Thief">{{IDWAdventuresCite|1|[[Tales from Wild Space: Stop, Thief!]]}}</ref>

====Further progress before Christophsis====
{{Quote|So, it's General Kenobi who is leading this assault. He is known for his deceptive maneuvers.|Separatist commander TX-20, on the reputation of Obi-Wan|Innocents of Ryloth}}
Kenobi became a [[Jedi General]] in the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars as he led the [[Galactic Republic|Republic]] to many famed victories, and came to be known as "[[The Negotiator]]".<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" /> His apprentice, Anakin Skywalker, was risen to the rank of Jedi Knight for the war,<ref name="Rogue One Visual Guide">''[[Star Wars: Rogue One: The Ultimate Visual Guide]]''</ref> and the [[212th Attack Battalion]] was placed under Kenobi's command during the war effort.<ref name="Innocents of Ryloth">{{TCW|Innocents of Ryloth}}</ref><ref name="Legacy of Terror">{{TCW|Legacy of Terror}}</ref><ref name="The Citadel">{{TCW|The Citadel}}</ref><ref name="Landing at Point Rain">{{TCW|Landing at Point Rain}}</ref><ref name="Episode III" /> Early into the Clone Wars, Kenobi met the [[Supreme Commander of the Droid Army]], [[General]] [[Grievous]]. The two developed a rivalry and fought each other numerous times during the war, with Grievous considering Kenobi to be a Jedi he needed to kill "face to face."<ref name="Grievous Intrigue">{{TCW|Grievous Intrigue}}</ref>

He also built [[Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber (Jedi Master)|a new lightsaber]] -- one that he would use throughout the remainder of his life.<ref name="Episode III" /><ref name="Episode IV" />

At some point, Kenobi gave a lecture in the [[Jedi Temple central security station]] for younglings to learn about the Jedi recall signal, when [[Kanan Jarrus|Caleb Dume]] inadvertently gave him the idea to use the warning beacon to warn Jedi away from the temple instead of calling them back,<ref name="A New Dawn">''[[A New Dawn]]''</ref> an idea that would prove essential when Kenobi used it during the fall of the Republic.<ref name="Episode III" />

====Christophsis and Teth====
{{Quote|Just teach her everything I taught you and she'll turn out fine.''"<br />"''You know, something makes me think this was your idea from the start.|Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, on Ahsoka Tano|Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)}}
Kenobi and Skywalker were sent on a [[Battle of Christophsis|mission]] to bring relief supplies to Senator [[Bail Organa]] and the Republic forces that were trapped on [[Christophsis]] because of a Separatist blockade. Kenobi, who arrived later than his former apprentice, brought with him a [[stealth ship]] provided by the Republic, and gave orders to Skywalker to sneak past the blockade and deliver the supplies in secret, particularly so after Organa's command center was bombarded. However, Skywalker used the ship to attack the flagship of [[Admiral]] [[Trench]], and broke the blockade with his successful attack, prompting Kenobi to issue Skywalker his congratulations.<ref name="Cat and Mouse">{{TCW|Cat and Mouse}}</ref>

[[File:SlickApprehended.png|thumb|left|305x305px|Kenobi and Skywalker tending to the traitorous clone.]]
Following the skirmish in space, the two Jedi Generals and their clone troopers were sent to the planet's surface to fight off the droid army taking control of the planet. When Kenobi's position was compromised and his forces ambushed, he and Skywalker were forced to abort their mission and retreat, but not before [[Captain]] [[Rex]] took the severed head of a [[T-series tactical droid]] with them. Upon surmising of a security breach, the Jedi Generals went behind enemy lines to investigate while Rex and [[Commander]] [[CC-2224|Cody]] investigated their spy's identity. Upon arriving on the Separatist headquarters, Kenobi and Skywalker dueled [[Asajj Ventress]] and pursued her only to discover an enormous Separatist army ready to take over Christophsis. When the two Jedi returned to the command center, they found the traitor clone [[Slick]] apprehended by Rex and Cody, and the weapons depot, and many of the gunships and [[All Terrain Tactical Enforcer|AT-TEs]] destroyed.<ref name="The Hidden Enemy">{{TCW|The Hidden Enemy}}</ref>

Some time afterwards, Kenobi and Skywalker sent a ship for supplies, but Kenobi regretted the decision when a second wave of Separatist forces attacked them. During the fierce battle that ensued, the Republic forces managed to force the Separatist on a temporary retreat, but the need for reinforcements was evident. It was then that Kenobi met [[Ahsoka Tano]], who relayed Master Yoda's message to return to Coruscant for a new [[Mission to Jabba's Palace (Clone Wars)|mission]], but the impending Separatist threat made it impossible for them to leave their post. Awaiting reinforcements and under attack, Kenobi allowed Skywalker and Tano to go behind enemy lines to destroy their enemy's [[deflector shield]] generator with him stalling for time by holding a fake surrender negotiation with General [[Whorm Loathsom|Loathsom]].<ref name="TCWFilm">[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|''Star Wars: The Clone Wars'' (film)]]</ref>

[[File:Obi-Wan Jabba negotiations.png|thumb|right|272x272px|Kenobi negotiating with Jabba the Hutt.]]
With Skywalker and Tano's timely destruction of the generator, Kenobi captured Loathsom and met up with Yoda, who arrived with reinforcements. The small General then assigned Kenobi to negotiate with [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba]] the use of their trading routes for safe passage within the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]]. Kenobi, then flew to Tatooine and assured the [[Hutt]] that [[Rotta]] would be returned safely and to secure a promise from the [[crime lord]]. Afterwards, he went to [[Teth]] to support Skywalker and participate in the [[Battle of Teth]], only to duel Ventress once again on his own before her escape. Along with Yoda, Kenobi later reunited with his former apprentice and Tano after they successfully returned Rotta to his father.<ref name="TCWFilm" />

====Jedi council meeting====
At some point prior the destruction of Jedi Master [[Plo Koon]]'s fleet by the secret Separatist [[warship]], ''[[Malevolence]]'', Kenobi was of the representatives of the Jedi council that asked senator Bail Organa, to travel to nearby [[Toydaria]] and ask [[King]] [[Katuunko]] to use the planet as a staging base.<ref name="Supply Lines">{{TCW|Supply Lines}}</ref>

====The ''Malevolence''====
{{Quote|That's your plan? Just fly there, land, hope they don't spot us, and walk in the door?''"<br />"''Basically.''"<br />"''Oh. Brilliant. Let's get going.|Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker|Destroy Malevolence}}
When Master Plo Koon's fleet was destroyed by the secret Separatist superweapon, the ''Malevolence'' during the [[Battle of Abregado]], and Skywalker reported Plo Koon's interrupted message, Kenobi took part―along with Chancellor Palpatine, Windu and Yoda―in the meeting that decided Skywalker was to reinforce Kenobi's fleet to mount a taskforce and not send a rescue for the attack's possible survivors from the [[Abregado system]]. Waiting for Skywalker to join him with his fleet, he prompted the wayward Jedi to meet them as fast as he could. Though his fleet did join him, however, its General did not, as Skywalker and Tano were rescuing Plo Koon and some of his men. Kenobi, then, told the Council of his disobedience but also reported that Skywalker's fleet had reunited with his own. Fortunately, they managed to retrieve important information about the ''Malevolence''.<ref name="Rising Malevolence">{{TCW|Rising Malevolence|Rising ''Malevolence''}}</ref>

[[File:Obi-Wan reports to Nala Se.png|thumb|left|284x284px|Kenobi and Yularen reporting to Nala Se.]]
Upon learning of the ''Malevolences''’s next target―a clone medical station in the Outer Rim―, Kenobi and Skywalker formulated a daring plan to engage and destroy the ''Malevolence''’s [[ion cannon]]s with the [[Shadow Squadron]], only for Kenobi to enter the system and destroy the massive warship using the combined fire power of his fleet. Along with [[Wullf Yularen]], Kenobi helped organize the evacuation of the medical center, dispatching medical frigates. While Skywalker's task force proved successful in destroying its cannons, the ''Malevolence'' was so large that it could withstand the fire of Kenobi's fleet.<ref name="Shadow of Malevolence">{{TCW|Shadow of Malevolence|Shadow of ''Malevolence''}}</ref>

[[File:Kenobi vs Grievous Malevolence.png|296x296px|right|thumb|Kenobi clashing with Grievous onboard the ''Malevolence''.]]
However, when Senator Amidala appeared during the [[Battle of the Kaliida Nebula|battle]] due to false information regarding a diplomatic mission to the system and her ship was pulled aboard the ''Malevolence'' by a [[tractor beam]], the pair quickly mounted a mission to rescue her. It ultimately proved successful, even though Kenobi was forced to engage in a brief duel with General [[Grievous]] while attempting to sabotage the warship's hyperdrive. Combined with Skywalker and Amidala's rigging of the [[Navigation computer|navcomputer]] to pilot it into a nearby [[moon]], they escaped and destroyed the ''Malevolence''.<ref name="Destroy Malevolence">{{TCW|Destroy Malevolence|Destroy ''Malevolence''}}</ref>

====The Rishi Moon====
Some weeks later, while searching for General Grievous and his fleet, Kenobi and Skywalker came to the aid of Commander Cody and Captain Rex, after the pair of clones [[Battle of the Rishi moon|engaged]] Separatist forces on the [[Rishi moon]]. The Jedi's fleet arrived just in time to force Grievous' ships out of the system, foiling the cyborg's plot to launch a surprise attack on Kamino.<ref name="Rookies">{{TCW|Rookies}}</ref>

====Grievous's attacks====

When he heard of Grievous's [[Conquest of the Outer Rim|ambushing]] Republic fleets following the Republic's [[Battle of Falleen|defeat]] at [[Falleen (planet)|Falleen]], Kenobi advised Skywalker to retreat, but Skywalker managed to [[Battle of Bothawui|destroy]] the cyborg's flotilla at the cost of losing R2-D2 at [[Bothawui]].<ref name="Downfall of a Droid">{{TCW|Downfall of a Droid}}</ref> Exasperated, Kenobi grudgingly accepted Skywalker's [[Mission to Skytop Station|mission]] to retrieve the [[Astromech droid|droid]] without severely rebuking him despite his reckless behavior.<ref name="Duel of Droids">{{TCW|Duel of the Droids}}</ref>

====Dooku captured====
{{Quote|They are devious and deceitful and, most importantly, stupid.''"<br />"''It's a wonder you don't get along with them, Dooku. You have so much in common.|Dooku and Obi-Wan Kenobi|Dooku Captured}}
Kenobi and Skywalker later spearheaded an [[Skirmish at Vanqor|attempt]] to capture the head of the Confederacy, Count Dooku himself. While the Jedi's attempts to capture the Count aboard his flagship proved unsuccessful, Tano's forces successfully made Dooku crash land on [[Vanqor]] during his escape from the doomed vessel. While Kenobi and Skywalker searched for the Count in a cave nearby to the wreckage of his personal craft, Dooku used the Force to cause a roof collapse, trapping the Jedi and securing his escape.<ref name="Dooku Captured">{{TCW|Dooku Captured}}</ref>

[[File:Epguide11.png|thumb|left|290x290px|Dooku's incarceration confirmed by Kenobi and Skywalker.]]
After Dooku was captured by the [[Ohnaka Gang|pirates]] who hoped to trade him for a hefty ransom from the Republic, Kenobi and Skywalker were sent to the pirates' stronghold to ensure they had indeed captured Dooku. When the two Jedi confirmed so, Chancellor Palpatine had Representative Binks and Senator [[Kharrus]] lead a diplomatic [[Mission to Florrum|mission]] to trade a ransom for the Count.<ref name="Dooku Captured" /> Captain [[Hondo Ohnaka]], the leader of the [[pirate]]s, however, proved treacherous and captured Skywalker and Kenobi, hoping to gain an additional ransom for them. Fortunately, Representative Binks was able to rescue them, though the mission did come at the cost of Senator Kharrus' life and Dooku's escape.<ref name="The Gungan General">{{TCW|The Gungan General}}</ref>

====Orto Plutonia====
{{Quote|Now that you have created peace between your people and the Talz, remember one crucial thing...''"<br />"''Yes, Master Kenobi?''"<br />"''Make it last, senator. Make it last.|Obi-Wan Kenobi and Riyo Chuchi|Trespass}}
[[File:ObiWanHugged-Trespass.png|thumb|right|296x296px|Kenobi surprised by a hug given by Thi-Sen in lieu of a handshake.]]
Called to [[Orto Plutonia]] to ascertain why the Republic had lost contact with a clone outpost, Kenobi and Skywalker, along with [[Chairman]] [[Chi Cho]] and Senator [[Riyo Chuchi]], found the Republic base to be devoid of life, all clones stationed there having been killed, much like a nearby Separatist base. Following clues to a canyon, Skywalker and Kenobi met the [[Talz|Talz.]] They learned the droids attacked the Talz and the clones simply were caught in the middle of the conflict. The Jedi, now knowing the Talz only wanted to be left in peace, arranged a diplomatic meeting between the [[Pantoran]]s and the Talz.<ref name="Trespass">{{TCW|Trespass}}</ref>

However, Chi Cho's arrogance would provoke a war between him and [[Thi-Sen]]'s people, with him proclaiming it was an internal affair of [[Pantora]] so as to remove the Jedi from the equation. Skywalker and Kenobi appealed to Chuchi to find a way to resolve the political matter diplomatically, and she contacted the Speaker of the [[Pantoran Assembly]] near [[Glid Station]], who granted her the authority to negotiate peace and declared the Chairman out of order. However, the solution came too late as Chi Cho was [[Battle of Orto Plutonia|attacked]] before Kenobi, Skywalker, and Chuchi landed halted the Talz's attack. To settle the conflict between the Pantorans and the Talz, Chuchi met with Thi-Sen, establishing an agreement that allowed the Talz to live in peace on the planet. As the Senator and the Jedi boarded a gunship offworld, Kenobi congratulated the Senator in creating peace and urged her to make it last and act as an example to others.<ref name="Trespass" />

====Blue Shadow Virus====
{{Quote|A great leap forward often requires taking two steps back.|Obi-Wan Kenobi|Mystery of a Thousand Moons}}
The Jedi Council later sent Kenobi, Skywalker and Tano, to Naboo in response to intel that suggested that a Separatist bio-lab had been set up on the planet. Senator Amidala and Representative Binks set off to search for the lab, but contact was lost, and Skywalker sent Tano along with the Gungan native [[Peppi Bow]] to locate them. Meanwhile, Skywalker and Kenobi learned from new information discovered by Captain [[Gregar Typho]] that Separatist scientist [[Nuvo Vindi]] was using the lab to perfect the deadly [[Blue Shadow Virus]] so as to release it into key Republic star systems. After being contacted by Tano, Kenobi and Skywalker [[Raid on Nuvo Vindi's laboratory|entered]] and aided Tano, before beginning a search for Vindi's [[viral bomb]]s. Though Vindi attempted to release the virus, the Jedi were able to apprehend him and rescue Amidala and Binks.<ref name="Blue Shadow Virus">{{TCW|Blue Shadow Virus (episode)|Blue Shadow Virus}}</ref>

[[File:Angel2.png|thumb|left|279x279px|Kenobi talking to an Angel.]]
As Kenobi and Skywalker prepared to transfer Vindi for trial, Tano, Amidala and several clones discovered that a vial of the virus was missing. Though they were able to sound the alarm, it was not in time, and Vindi's servant droid was able to detonate a bomb, releasing the virus throughout the lab. The Jedi were then forced to make their way to the planet of [[Iego]] to [[Mission to Iego|search]] for the antidote to the virus, so as to save Amidala and Tano. While on Iego, the Jedi were able to free the people there from an insidious Separatist security system designed to prevent the inhabitants from leaving the planet, with the help of young [[Jaybo Hood]]. They were also able to locate the antidote and returned in time to save Tano, Amidala and most of the clones.<ref name="Mystery of a Thousand Moons">{{TCW|Mystery of a Thousand Moons}}</ref>

====Ryloth====
{{Quote|We need to remember why we're here. We came to aid the Twi'leks, not destroy their home.|Kenobi to [[Ghost Company]] aboard the ''[[Crumb Bomber]]''|audio=AidTheTwi'leks-IoR.ogg|Innocents of Ryloth}}
After [[Techno Union]] leader [[Wat Tambor]] seized control of [[Ryloth]] and its [[Twi'lek|inhabitants]], the Jedi Council devised a plan for Kenobi and Mace Windu to lead a ground assault to [[Battle of Ryloth|invade and liberate]] the planet, while Skywalker and Tano were dispatched to destroy the Separatist blockade surrounding the planet. Once Skywalker and Tano's forces were successful, Kenobi arrived with the rest of the invasion forces.<ref name="Storm Over Ryloth">{{TCW|Storm Over Ryloth}}</ref>

[[File:Obi-Wan distracts gutkurrs.jpg|230px|right|thumb|Kenobi distracting gutkurrs.]]
Unable to use [[Acclamator-class transgalactic military assault ship|''Acclamator''-class transgalactic military assault ships]] and other gunships from ''[[Crumb Bomber]]'', Kenobi and [[Ghost Company]] landed on Ryloth, and Windu tasked the Jedi General with destroying the Separatist [[Proton cannon|cannons]] to allow the transports to land. After taking out droids in a bunker on the outskirts of the village, Kenobi and the clones entered the city and set up a temporary camp. Then, Kenobi sent Cody, [[Wooley]], [[Waxer]] and [[Boil]] to scout ahead. Cody and Wooley came back and reported that the droids had taken the Twi'leks as hostages. Following a conference with Windu, Kenobi and his troops entered the village where they encountered starved [[gutkurr]]s that began to attack them. The Jedi lured the creatures into an alley so that the clones could trap them by collapsing a bridge between them.<ref name="Innocents of Ryloth" />

When Waxer and Boil then emerged out of an underground tunnel with the young [[Numa]], Kenobi talked to the girl in [[Twi'leki]] and learned that she could lead them to the prisoners. Tasking Cody with creating a diversion for the droids, Kenobi went with Waxer, Boil and Numa to the underground passages and freed the Twi'lek hostages, who fled into the tunnels. Then, Kenobi took control of a proton cannon, and with the help of Waxer and Boil, he managed to take out other cannons until a [[TX-20]] blasted the three aside.<ref name="Innocents of Ryloth" />

[[File:TX-20 targets Obi-Wan and Numa.png|230px|left|thumb|TX-20's tank targets Kenobi and Numa.]]
Fortunately, the Twi'leks protected them, with Kenobi attempting to shield Numa's eyes from the violence. As the ''Acclamator'' transports landed, Windu commended Kenobi on his victory, but they continued with their next mission. As the Republic forces departed for [[Lessu]], Waxer and Boil inquired Kenobi about the meaning of "Nerra", which the Jedi General translated as "brother."<ref name="Innocents of Ryloth" /> After Windu and and his forces reached Lessu, Kenobi led his contingent to capture the southern hemisphere of Ryloth and was able to successfully take the [[Jixuan desert]]. With Windu taking Lessu and capturing Wat Tambor, the two Jedi Generals freed the planet from Separatist rule.<ref name="Liberty on Ryloth">{{TCW|Liberty on Ryloth}}</ref>

====The stolen holocron====
{{Quote|There are thousands of children on that list. Which will he go after first?|Obi-Wan Kenobi|Children of the Force}}
[[File:BattleOfFelucia-HH.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Kenobi and Skywalker during the first battle of Felucia.]]
During the [[First battle of Felucia|First Battle of Felucia]], Master Kenobi was sent along with Skywalker and Tano to [[Felucia]] which had been invaded by the Separatists. While Obi-Wan, Skywalker, Commander Cody and Captain Rex stayed with the main body of troops to defend their clearing-based emplacement of AT-TE walkers, Tano led two AT-TE walkers and a [[Juggernaut]] tank on a patrol of the dense jungle. Kenobi realized that they were losing and ordered the retreat as soon as Master Plo Koon arrived to help them. Kenobi contacted Tano who refused to retreat. Even though Skywalker and Kenobi arrived to pick her up, she refused to pull back until Skywalker convinced her that the battle was lost. Kenobi later reported to the rest of the Jedi Council about Tano's actions during the battle back at the Jedi Temple.<ref name="Holocron Heist">{{TCW|Holocron Heist}}</ref>

[[File:KenobiBlackStallStation-CotF.jpg|thumb|left|210px|Kenobi defending against Bane's automated laser defense system on Black Stall Station.]]
On Yoda's warning of an intrusion in the Temple, Kenobi and Skywalker surmised that the intruders might want to take hold of Jedi transmitter codes from their communications tower center, but [[Cad Bane]] managed to trick them and [[Mission to the Jedi Temple|steal]] a [[holocron]] from the [[Holocron Vault|vault]].<ref name="Holocron Heist" /> Once the Jedi was warned of the objective, Force-sensitive children, Kenobi was sent to [[Rodia]] in hopes of finding [[Wee Dunn]] only for Bane to take the infant before Kenobi could capture him.<ref name="Children of the Force">{{TCW|Children of the Force}}</ref>

After Bane was captured by Skywalker and Tano on Naboo, Kenobi, Windu and Skywalker all used a mind trick on him at the same time to make him talk. Bane resisted but the Jedi's combined efforts forced him to agree to take them to the children and the holocron. Later, Kenobi and Windu went on a [[Mission to Black Stall Station|mission]] with the bounty hunter to his [[Black Stall Station|hideout]]. Bane took them to the holocron but then Windu accidentally triggered the intruder-alert system, causing lasers to fire on the two Jedi Masters. While Kenobi and Windu were occupied, Bane fled. However Kenobi and Windu still managed to retrieve the holocron and escape the base just before it was destroyed while Skywalker and Tano [[Mission to Mustafar (Skywalker and Tano)|rescued]] the kidnapped children from [[Mustafar]].<ref name="Children of the Force" />

====Felucia====
[[File:Embo hurt.png|thumb|right|220px|Sugi, Kenobi and others coming to the aid of Embo.]]
Afterwards, the disappearance of a medical station orbiting over Felucia prompted the Jedi Council to send Kenobi, Skywalker and Tano to investigate the issue. Once in the system, they were shot down by Separatist [[Variable Geometry Self-Propelled Battle Droid, Mark I|vulture droids]] and forced to crash land on Felucia, where they came across a [[nysillin]] farm village raided by Hondo Ohnaka and his gang, whom they had met on Florrum.<ref name="The Gungan General" /> Despite Kenobi's reluctance to help them in case they attracted Grievous' attention, the three Jedi took part of a [[Skirmish on Felucia|skirmish]] between the village and pirates, and assisted the bounty hunters hired by the farmers to protect them—[[Sugi (bounty hunter)|Sugi]], [[Embo]], [[Rumi Paramita]] and [[Seripas]]. Following their victory and the gang's retreat, with Ohnaka claiming the land was no longer profitable, Sugi offered them a ride to a Republic outpost.<ref name="Bounty Hunters">{{TCW|Bounty Hunters (episode)|Bounty Hunters}}</ref>

====The Zillo Beast====
{{Quote|Why would the Chancellor want to bring the beast here? He thinks that by studying it, the knowledge could prove beneficial, but from what you reported, it hardly seems worth the effort.|Obi-Wan Kenobi|The Zillo Beast Strikes Back}}
Following the discovery of the [[Zillo Beast]] during the [[Battle of Malastare]]<ref name="The Zillo Beast">{{TCW|The Zillo Beast}}</ref> and its transference to Coruscant, Windu shared his concerns with Kenobi, who agreed with him and suggested to let Skywalker convince the Chancellor of sending back the beast. Kenobi, then, approached Senator Amidala to help him—who, in turn, helped him convince Skywalker—to reason with Palpatine. However, Palpatine had already ordered [[Doctor]] [[Sionver Boll]] to kill the beast to extract its scales, and the poison intended to kill it only caused the creature to become agitated and aggressive. Once it managed to break free of its bonds, smashed its way out of the laboratory and started [[Zillo Beast incident|rampaging]] across Coruscant to reach the [[Senate Building|Senate]] building and Palpatine in it.<ref name="The Zillo Beast Strikes Back">{{TCW|The Zillo Beast Strikes Back}}</ref>

Deployed to contain the beast, Kenobi and Windu managed to save the Chancellor [[Telekinesis|using]] the Force and, later, commanded gunships to distract the beast together with Yoda and [[Aayla Secura]] while the Chancellor escaped with Skywalker, Amidala, R2-D2 and C-3PO. As the gunships arrived and killed the creature by firing poison gas bombs into into its mouth, Kenobi and the others looked on in regret, as the Zillo Beast finally succumbed to the poison and fell from the roof of the Senate to its death below.<ref name="The Zillo Beast" />

====Separatist Spy====
Kenobi later participated in a meeting in which he and the council assigned Amidala to spy on [[Rush Clovis]] whom they believed was a Separatist spy.<ref name="Senate Spy">{{TCW|Senate Spy}}</ref>

====Second Battle of Geonosis====
{{Quote|I cannot believe we're back here again.|Obi-Wan Kenobi|Landing at Point Rain}}
[[File:GeonosisPlanning.png|thumb|left|220px|Kenobi, other Jedi and the Chancellor plan their invasion of Geonosis.]]
Assigned to capture Geonosis, alongside [[Ki-Adi-Mundi]], [[Luminara Unduli]], Skywalker and Tano, Kenobi participated in a conference to delineate the [[Second Battle of Geonosis|invasion]] plans to destroy [[Poggle the Lesser]]'s primary droid factory, which was being protected by a massive ray shield. With their primary target being the shield generator at the [[Ray Shield Fortress/Canon|Ray Shield Fortress]], the Jedi mounted a three-pronged attack on the Geonosian defenses. Kenobi and Cody commenced the central push while Mundi and Skywalker lead the northern and southern assaults, respectively. Though Kenobi's able to reach the landing, the Jedi General was injured and forced to await for Skywalker and Mundi's arrival who, despite their obstacles, managed to join Kenobi. In a combined effort, they managed to destroy the shield generator, and Kenobi and Mundi returned to the fleet with the rest of the wounded for treatment.<ref name="Landing at Point Rain" />

Following the factory's destruction by Skywalker, Tano, Unduli and [[Barriss Offee]]<ref>{{TCW|Weapons Factory}}</ref> and the Republic's hard-won victory, Kenobi returned to the planet and mounted an intense campaign to find Poggle, with Unduli spearheading the search only to follow Poggle to the [[Progate Temple]], where she was captured by the Archduke and taken to the lair of Geonosian Queen [[Karina the Great (Clone Wars)|Karina the Great]] in the catacombs below. Tracking Unduli's last known location, Kenobi and Skywalker set out with a clone platoon to rescue her, and entered the catacombs only to find themselves before the Queen and her "undead" servants. Soon enough, and thanks to Kenobi's plans, they freed Luminara, captured Poggle and escaped the temple, while destroying much of the Queen's lair during their escape, burying Karina the Great and her warriors beneath.<ref name="Legacy of Terror" /> Kenobi, Mundi, Unduli and Skywalker, then, took Poggle to Coruscant for interrogation, while Offee and Tano brought to supplies to Windu and [[Kit Fisto]] on [[Dantooine]].<ref name="Brain Invaders">{{TCW|Brain Invaders}}</ref>

====Saleucami====
{{Quote|The story of Obi-Wan Kenobi ends here.|General Grievous, about to finish Kenobi|Grievous Intrigue}}
Soon after Jedi Master and Council member [[Eeth Koth]] was captured by Grievous, Kenobi, Skywalker and [[Adi Gallia]] volunteered to [[Battle of Saleucami|engage]] the Confederacy at Saleucami, rescue Koth, and capture General Grievous.<ref name="Grievous Intrigue" />

[[File:Grievous vs. Kenobi Saleucami.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Kenobi engages Grievous in the docking tube.]]
Kenobi was the first of the Jedi to arrive at Saleucami and engaged Grievous's forces with a fleet under the command of Admiral Yularen. Early in the battle, Kenobi's light cruiser was caught in a tractor beam from Grievous's ship and boarded by the cyborg General himself. Once Skywalker and Gallia rescued Eeth Koth, Grievous dueled Kenobi until understanding that the Jedi Master had the upper hand. As the cyborg retreated to his destroyer, he ordered his ship to destroy Kenobi's—who managed to board Grievous' ship with Cody and two other clones before it was too late thanks to Gallia's help. Afterwards, they reunited with Skywalker on the hangar so that they could escape from Grievous' ship, whose General was forced to flee in an [[escape pod]] to land on the planet.<ref name="Grievous Intrigue" />

While his fellow Jedi generals continued the battle in orbit, Kenobi led a force of clone troopers to the planet's surface to hunt down Grievous. The cyborg General evaded and fled from the Republic forces, hoping to reach an escape pod with a functioning transmitter in order to call for an evacuation transport. When Kenobi caught up with and engaged Grievous, the cyborg fled the battle once a shuttle arrived to ferry him away. Seeing as the mission had failed, Kenobi contacted Rex and told him to meet them to leave the planet.<ref name="TD">{{TCW|The Deserter}}</ref>

====Mandalore's Death Watch====
{{Quote|We'll have to stand and fight. Or in your case, just stand.|Obi-Wan Kenobi to Satine Kryze|audio=StandAndFight-TMP.ogg|The Mandalore Plot}}
[[File:Memorial Shrine bombing.jpg|thumb|left|230px|The memorial shrine being bombed as Kenobi and Duchess Satine Kryze looked on.]]
When rumors spread that the new leader of the [[Council of Neutral Systems]], Duchess Satine Kryze, was secretly building her own army to fight for the Separatist cause, Kenobi was [[Mandalore Defense Resolution|sent]] to [[Sundari]] by the Jedi Council to investigate the matter. There, he met [[Prime Minister]] [[Almec]] and re-encountered his old friend, Kryze, who assured him that she was not behind an attack to a Republic cruiser. Angered at the accusations, she claimed the Senate was eager to intervene in the planet's affairs before being corrected by Kenobi, who claimed to be there on the Jedi Order's interest. Assuaged, the Duchess then took Kenobi for a walk on [[Peace Park]] and informed him of a renegade group of warriors known as [[Death Watch]] when a terrorist [[Bombing of the memorial shrine|blew up]] the memorial shrine where Kryze and Kenobi were walking. When Kenobi had the guards round up everyone at the scene, [[Death Watch bomber|a man]] fled with Kenobi after him and committed suicide instead of being captured. As the Duchess spoke to the dying man, she realized he came from [[Concordia]] and helped Kenobi reach the moon, where the Jedi Master met its [[Governor]], [[Pre Vizsla]].<ref name="The Mandalore Plot">{{TCW|The Mandalore Plot}}</ref>

[[File:Kenobi vs Vizsla.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Kenobi engaging Pre Vizsla in a duel.]]
Kenobi went out to investigate the [[Concordian mines|mines]] and discovered that the Death Watch was using one of the facilities as a base. Taken hostage by the Death Watch, he contacted Kryze, who freed him, and together, they tried to escape when they were attacked and the Commander of the Death Watch arrived. Revealing himself to be Viszla, he returned Kenobi's lightsaber and dueled him with the [[Darksaber]], until he ordered his warrior to kill him with missiles. Kenobi and Kryze managed to escape, barely surviving, and returned to Mandalore. The next day, Kenobi told the Duchess that he believed the Separatists were involved, which only angered her; the Jedi Master, then, was joined by Skywalker so as to bodyguard her during her and other senators' trip to Coruscant onboard the ''[[Coronet]]''.<ref name="The Mandalore Plot" />

On their way to the Republic's capital, Kenobi took part of a heated debate with the Duchess over what the best course of action was to deal with the conflict, until they took a little break. Then, Skywalker asked him Kenobi of their past, which Kenobi explained he and his master, Jinn, had been protecting her during a year-long, dangerous mission during a civil war on Mandalore. It was then that [[assassin droid]]s were activated, prompting Kenobi to defend Kryze. When the droids were stopped, Skywalker reported to Kenobi that one of the senators was a traitor, and Kenobi then devised a plan to uncover the traitor's identity by using the last active droid.<ref name="Voyage of Temptation" />

[[File:Obi-Wan Satine VoT.png|thumb|left|210px|Kryze safely arriving on Coruscant thanks to Kenobi's help.]]
It turned out to be [[Tal Merrik]], who took Kryze as a hostage and made his way to the cockpit to jump out of hyperspace, so that droid reinforcements could enter the ship. While Skywalker engaged the droids, Kenobi found and followed Merrik, who would blow up the ship, as he got near the escape pods, unable to make a move on the senator. Afraid she might not see Kenobi again, Kryze confessed her feelings for him, to which Kenobi replied he would have left the Order if she had told him earlier. Then, Kryze took the opportunity to escape a disgusted Merrik and take his blaster. However, neither Kenobi nor Kryze made a move to stop him, leaving Skywalker to sneak up from behind and stab him in the back, branding himself as a "cold-blooded killer." After arriving on Coruscant, Kenobi and Kryze reflected upon the situation, and the Duchess flirted with him, saying his beard hid too much of his "handsome face."<ref name="Voyage of Temptation" />

When Kryze's pleas to the Senate to not interfere with Mandalore's internal affairs went unheard, Kenobi reunited with the Duchess, advising her not to be rash, angering her. Soon enough, she was victim to another terrorist attack and barely survived, prompting the Senate to accelerate the vote—with the Republic deciding to occupate Mandalore. Despite Kenobi's plea to help her, Kryze took matters in her own hands, only to framed with murder by the Death Watch.<ref name="Duchess of Mandalore">{{TCW|Duchess of Mandalore}}</ref>

[[File:SKASOWKPAPMA-DoM.png|thumb|right|210px|Chancellor Palpatine apologizing to Duchess Satine Kryze.]]
Asking for his help, Kenobi met her and accepted to give Senator Amidala the disc she had obtained from his contact. Despite an attack by a Death Watch assassin and Kryze turning herself in, Kenobi got the disc through to Amidala, who then played the complete recording from Deputy Prime Minister [[Jerec (Deputy Minister)|Jerec]] in front of the Senate—prompting the Senate to vote against Mandalore's occupation. When the Duchess received the apologies and thanks from the Chancellor and [[Mas Amedda]], Kenobi received her thanks, though the two reflected about not knowing who tried to drag Mandalore into war and have the Duchess framed for murder.<ref name="Duchess of Mandalore" />

====Kamino under attack====
{{Quote|All too easy.''"<br />"''Define 'easy,' General.|Grievous and Kenobi|ARC Troopers}}
After the destruction of the Rishi moon tracking station, Kenobi and Skywalker intercepted a coded message between Ventress and Grievous. Generals Kenobi and Skywalker, Commander Cody, Captain Rex and troopers of the [[501st Legion|501st]] went to Kamino to aid in its defense. As Skywalker fought in the space above Kamino, Kenobi took a submarine and discovered Ventress's forces readying their assault crafts under water. [[Aqua droid]]s attacked his submarine, but he escaped thanks to a passing [[aiwha]]. The Jedi General managed to get back and recalled Skywalker to the city as the Separatists commanders Grievous and Ventress attacked; while Kenobi faced off against Grievous, Skywalker engaged Ventress in combat. The two generals dueled until an assault craft destroyed the platform they were dueling on. Grievous thought he had defeated Kenobi, but an aiwha saved the Jedi again. Unfortunately, Grievous and Ventress were able to escape once again.<ref name="ARC Troopers">{{TCW|ARC Troopers}}</ref>

====Ziro hunted====
{{Quote|I never did enjoy hanging out with you.|Kenobi to Quinlan Vos, hanging off the side of a cliff|Hunt for Ziro}}
[[File:BaneKenobi-Showdown.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Kenobi dueling Bane on Teth.]]
Later during the war, after the [[Senate hostage crisis]], Kenobi was assigned to track down [[Ziro Desilijic Tiure/Canon|Ziro]] the Hutt and Cad Bane with his old friend, Jedi Master [[Quinlan Vos]]. The two of them headed to [[Nal Hutta]], where they informed [[Gardulla Besadii the Elder|Gardulla]] the Hutt and the rest of the [[Grand Hutt Council|Hutt council]] of Ziro's escape and of Bane's help in this act. Though the Hutt Council denied involvement in this, Vos was able to psychometrically scan a cup, telling him and Kenobi that Ziro had been there. When they got to the prison level, however, Ziro had already escaped due to help from his lover, [[Sy Snootles]]. Kenobi and Vos then tracked Ziro down in the swamp, where they saw Bane following Ziro as well, and found [[Mama|Ziro's mother]] who told them that his son had gone to Teth, where he would secretly recover the [[Hutt Council records]].<ref name="Hunt for Ziro">{{TCW|Hunt for Ziro}}</ref>

Kenobi and Vos then proceeded to Teth, where they found Ziro shot and dead at his [[Ziro's father|Father's]] grave, and were then confronted by Bane. Though Bane tried to leave, Kenobi attempted to arrest Bane for taking the Senate hostage and engaged in a [[Showdown on Teth|duel]] with the bounty hunter. Despite the Jedi's best efforts, Bane used his flamethrowers to throw them off the cliff, leaving the two to hang on a cliff, and escaped.<ref name="Hunt for Ziro" />

====Dathomirian threat====
{{Quote|Warrior-like men, witches—this place has all kinds of fun.|Anakin Skywalker to Kenobi, on Dathomir|Witches of the Mist}}
During the [[Battle of Sullust]], Kenobi was chased by Asajj Ventress in her [[Ginivex-class fanblade starfighter|''Ginivex''-class fanblade starfighter]]. Skywalker managed to dispatch the [[Droid tri-fighter|tri-fighter]] that the assassin had sent for him and came to the aid of his former master. He then crippled Ventress's vessel, but not before she managed to shoot down the Jedi Master. The two opposing commanders crash-landed in the hangar of the Separatist command ship, Kenobi and Skywalker quickly engaged Ventress in lightsaber combat. Count Dooku, upon orders from his own master, interrupted the duel by ordering the destruction of the Separatist command ship to ensure Ventress's death. The two Jedi fled in their interceptors, presuming Ventress to be doomed but she escaped and Dooku retreated, thinking she was dead.<ref name="Nightsisters">{{TCW|Nightsisters (episode)|Nightsisters}}</ref>

[[File:ShowdownOnToydaria-WOTM.png|right|thumb|210px|Kenobi facing Savage Opress on Toydaria]]
After the [[Devaron massacre|massacre]] on [[Devaron]],<ref>{{TCW|Monster}}</ref> Kenobi and Skywalker were sent to [[Dathomir]], as footage had shown the Council of a [[Savage Opress|Dathomirian's]] role during the attack on Devaron. Once on Dathomir, they made their way to [[Nightbrother village|a village]], where they were ambushed by the [[Nightbrothers]] until Skywalker took [[Viscus|their leader]] hostage; the [[Zabrak]] then told the Jedi that a [[Nightsisters|Nightsister]] had taken one of their [[Nightsister lair|fortress]], prompting the Jedi to go there. Kenobi and Skywalker questioned [[Mother (title)|Mother]] [[Talzin]] who told them his name—Savage Opress—and whereabouts. The two Jedi then headed to Toydaria where they confronted Opress, but failed to stop him from killing Katuunko. Using the king's ship as their was destroyed, Kenobi and Skywalker caught up with their target on Dooku's Separatist flagship; however, Opress managed to overpower them, forcing the two to retreat and leave the ship.<ref name="Witches of the Mist">{{TCW|Witches of the Mist}}</ref>

====Mortis====
{{Quote|Obi-Wan, have you done as I asked? Have you trained the boy?|Qui-Gon Jinn to Obi-Wan Kenobi|Overlords}}
[[File:ObiWanQuiGon-Overlords.png|thumb|left|220px|Kenobi converses with the Force ghost of his master, Jinn.]]
When the Jedi Council received a 2,000 year old Jedi distress code, Kenobi along with Skywalker and Tano were [[Mission to Mortis|sent]] to the [[Chrelythiumn system|Chrelythium system]], where they were supposed to meet up with Captain Rex and an armed cruiser. Though they both made to the rendezvous point, neither Rex's nor the Jedi's ship could see each other. In fact, the Jedi's ship was guided to a [[Mortis|mysterious planet]], where they were met by a [[Force wielder|mysterious figure]] called the [[Daughter]] who wanted to lead them to [[Father (Mortis)|The Father]]. Shortly after, Skywalker and the Daughter were separated from Kenobi and Tano.<ref name="Overlords">{{TCW|Overlords}}</ref>

Trying to return to the [[Jedi shuttle 634|ship]], Kenobi and Tano met the [[Son]], who suggested them to take shelter from the oncoming storm. In a cave, when Tano was asleep, his late master, Qui-Gon Jinn, [[Force spirit|appeared]] before him, explaining the purpose of the planet they were on and that the three figures they encountered, like Jinn, believed Skywalker was the Chosen One. As Jinn disappeared, Kenobi woke Tano up and they resolved to find Skywalker together, only for the Daughter and the Son to capture them for Skywalker's test. In danger of being killed by the Daughter, Kenobi was saved when Skywalker subdued their captors, proving himself to be the Chosen One, and the three Jedi tried to leave the planet.<ref name="Overlords" />

[[File:KenobiMortisDagger-AOM.png|thumb|230px|right|Kenobi trying to hand Skywalker the Dagger.]]
However, Tano was abducted by the Son, which prompted Kenobi and Skywalker to go their separate ways. While Kenobi went to ask the Father - whom he thought would know what to do - for help, Skywalker went after the Son, fearing he would kill Tano. When he reached the [[Mortis monastery|monastery]], he witnessed as the Son mortally wounded his Father, and asked the Daughter for help. She then showed him the [[Altar of Mortis|Altar]], where he obtained a [[Dagger of Mortis|dagger]] that would allow them to kill the Son, and together they faced the Son on his [[Son's cathedral|cathedral]], only for the darksider to tell him of Skywalker and corrupted Tano's duel. Kenobi then helped Skywalker subdue Tano, until the Father's appearance interrupted them.<ref name="Altar of Mortis">{{TCW|Altar of Mortis (episode)|Altar of Mortis}}</ref>

As the Son was about to kill the Father, Kenobi tried to hand Skywalker the dagger, but Tano grabbed it and gave it to the Son, who killed her as her usefulness came to an end. The darksider then killed his sister as she stepped in to save her Father. Then, Kenobi witnessed as the Daughter used Skywalker as a conduit to channel the last of her life force into Tano, resurrecting her. The Father then commanded Kenobi, Skywalker, and Tano to leave the planet before the Son used their ship to do so;<ref name="Altar of Mortis" /> however, their ship's repairs forced them to stay a bit longer, so Kenobi let Skywalker go to the Father for guidance.<ref name="Ghosts of Mortis">{{TCW|Ghosts of Mortis}}</ref>

[[File:ObiWanWell-GOM.png|thumb|left|230px|Kenobi trying to climb himself out of the Well of the Dark Side.]]
The Father then, appeared before Kenobi and told him Skywalker had gone to the [[Well of the Dark Side]] to confront the Son, only to be shown his future and be corrupted by the [[dark side of the Force]]. Kenobi, who had gone to the well, was left stranded in there by Skywalker. Concerned, Kenobi contacted Tano and ordered her to disable the ship, fetch him on the well and meet with Skywalker—whose memories had been erased—and the Father on his Monastery. There, they confronted a newly arrived Son with the Dagger, but only the Father's sacrifice could stop the Son, with Skywalker finally killing the depowered darksider. As Mortis' conflict came to an end, Kenobi, Tano and Skywalker woke up in the ship, as if nothing had happened, and reunited with Captain Rex at the rendezvous point.<ref name="Ghosts of Mortis" />

====The Citadel====
{{Quote|Obi-Wan, what took you guys so long?|Even Piell, on his rescue|The Citadel}}
Following the [[Capture of Even Piell|capture]] of Jedi Master [[Even Piell]] and his imprisonment in the [[Citadel|the Citadel]], Kenobi, Skywalker, Commander Cody, Captain Rex, and other troopers from the 501st were sent to rescue the imprisoned Jedi. Joined by a rebellious Tano, Kenobi and the rest [[Carbon-freezing|froze]] themselves in [[carbonite]] to prevent the prison's [[Lifeform scanner/Canon|life scanners]] from detecting them, and infiltrated the prison. During their free climbing to the entry point, surrounded by [[electromine]]s, Tano sneaked through a ventilation duct to disable their entrance's [[ray shield]]. However, one trooper fell, alerting the prison of their arrival. Even then, the team made their way to Piell and freed him.<ref name="The Citadel" />

[[File:PiellRescued-TC.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker after freeing Master Piell.]]
Piell, then, revealed when the ship crashed, he and one of his Captains, [[Wilhuff Tarkin]], each memorized half of the intel on the [[Nexus Route]] so that, if one person broke, the information would be useless without the other half. Changing the plans, the team managed to rescue the other officers, where Piell presented Tarkin to Kenobi and Skywalker. Then, Kenobi suggested for them to split up—Tarkin accompanied Skywalker and Tano, while Kenobi and Piell would create a diversion to allow R2-D2 and his droids to take them off planet.<ref name="The Citadel" /> Kenobi and his team, however, were captured before making it to the rendezvous point and met the prison's commander, [[Osi Sobeck]], until R2-D2 and his squad freed them, to meet with Skywalker's team back at the shuttle, which was destroyed during the [[Battle of Lola Sayu|battle]] that ensued, taking [[CT-1409|Echo's]] live with it. Forced to escaped, Kenobi and Skywalker contacted the Jedi Council to send a rescue force to pick them up, and continued their escape through tunnels surrounding the tower.<ref name="Counter Attack">{{TCW|Counterattack}}</ref>

After Piell contacted the Council to know the exact point of their pick-up and Sobeck sent [[anooba]]s to track them down, Kenobi, Skywalker and R2-D2 posed as bait so that the rest of the team could ambush them. Despite being successful, Piell died during the confrontation, after telling Tano the Intel. She, then, reunited with the rest of the team and they all took a moment to honor his death, as Kenobi and Skywalker lowered his body into a river of lava with the Force. Nevertheless, they managed to get to the extraction point on time, even with Sobeck's intervention, and flee on Plo Koon's rescue shuttle, with [[Saesee Tiin]] doing cover fire to allow their escape back to Coruscant.<ref name="Citadel Rescue">{{TCW|Citadel Rescue}}</ref>

====Umbara====
{{Quote|Congratulations on your capture of the Umbaran airbase, general.|Obi-Wan Kenobi, to Pong Krell|The General}}
[[File:CloneBriefing-Umbara.png|left|thumb|250px|Kenobi during the briefing prior to the invasion of Umbara]]
Kenobi, along with fellow Jedi Tiin, Skywalker, and [[Pong Krell]], was deployed to [[Battle of Umbara|retake]] the [[Umbara]]. Kenobi's battalion's mission was to take the [[Umbara capital city|capital]] and met fierce resistance from the [[Umbaran]] [[Umbaran militia|militia]].<ref name="Darkness on Umbara">{{TCW|Darkness on Umbara}}</ref> Kenobi then contacted Krell and the 501st, to order them to secure a [[Unidentified Umbaran airbase|Umbaran airbase]] that was resupplying the capital.<ref name="The General">{{TCW|The General}}</ref>

After his battalion had been pushed away from the capital due to the Umbaran's long-rage missiles, Kenobi congratulated on his success on taking the airbase and informed him that the capital still receiving supplies, this time from a [[DH-Omni Support Vessel|Separatist supply ship|enemy supply ship]] in the atmosphere. He also informed Krell of oncoming, but delayed reinforcements, only for the [[Besalisk]] to tell him he would take his battalion to the city regardless of the capital's defenses. Kenobi's transmission was then jammed by the Umbarans.<ref name="Plan of Dissent">{{TCW|Plan of Dissent}}</ref> Despite Krell's efforts to sabotage the Republic effort by tricking the 501st and the 212th battalions into attacking each other, Kenobi was successful in taking the capital and routing the remaining Umbaran forces, securing all sectors of the planet for the Republic.<ref name="Carnage of Krell">{{TCW|Carnage of Krell}}</ref>

====Zygerria====
{{Quote|If such Jedi as Skywalker and Kenobi can fall, how many other will follow? Imagine an army of Jedi in your service.|Miraj Scintel, to Count Dooku|Escape from Kadavo}}
[[File:DNarPummelsKenobi-Kidnapped.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Kenobi getting pummelled by Zygerrian commander Darts D'Nar]]
Ten rotations after Master Yoda's last contact with the [[Togruta]] colony of [[Kiros]], Kenobi, Skywalker, Tano, Captain Rex, and Commander Cody landed on the colony, where they found no inhabitants and [[Battle of Kiros|fought]] their way through droid contingents on [[BARC speeder]]s to the [[governor's tower]]. Once they had the Separatist headquarters surrounded inside the governor's tower, Cody showed Kenobi a message from the Separatist commander, [[Darts D'Nar]], asking him to come to the tower to negotiate terms of "surrender." When Skywalker became angry at recognizing D'Nar as a [[Zygerrian]] [[Slavery|slaver]], Kenobi told his old apprentice to look for the colonists while he negotiated with D'Nar and explained Skywalker's history with slavery to Tano, who assured Kenobi she would keep an eye on him.<ref name="Kidnapped">{{TCW|Kidnapped}}</ref>

Kenobi then went into the tower and interrupted D'Nar's meeting with Dooku and Zygerrian Prime Minister [[Atai Molec]] to negotiate terms of surrender—the Republic's surrender. Kenobi then turned his [[comlink]] on so that Skywalker and Ahsoka could hear the fact that the Zygerrian had several [[Thermal annihilator bomb/Legends|bombs]] planted throughout the city. Kenobi then surrendered, but challenged D'Nar to a duel in the Zygerrian way (with no weapons) to distract him while Skywalker and Tano disarmed the bombs. Though he received a good beating from D'Nar, Kenobi successfully beguiled the Zygerrian, who set off his last bomb located on his tactical droid and escaped from the Jedi Master. Unable to pursue him, he told Skywalker and Tano of his departure. After Skywalker captured D'Nar and his ship, Kenobi, Skywalker and Ahsoka then contacted the Jedi Council, informing them of the Zygerrians' abduction of the colonists.<ref name="Kidnapped" />

[[File:BrezakEscape-SOTR.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Kenobi, Rex and Governor Roshti trying to escape.]]
Using D'Nar's ship, Kenobi, along with Skywalker, Tano, Captain Rex and R2-D2, [[Mission to Zygerria|traveled]] to Zygerria. Upon arrival they formed two teams; Skywalker and Tano went to talk to [[Queen]] [[Miraj Scintel]] disguised as master and slave, respectively, while Kenobi and Rex, disguised as Zygerrian traders, tried to locate the kidnapped colonists from Kiros. The two proceeded to the [[Royal Palace of Zygerria|Royal palace's]] slave pits where they found the Togrutan Governor of Kiros, [[Roshti]], weak and broken from his ordeal. With Rex, Kenobi decided to take him to safety on a [[brezak]], only for Kenobi to be shot in the shoulder and captured along with Roshti, with Rex safely escaping. Chained to a wall and tortured for information, Kenobi was recognized as a Jedi by Prime Minister Atai Molec, and prepared to sell him at that night's auction block.<ref name="Slaves of the Republic">{{TCW|Slaves of the Republic}}</ref>

At the auction, Roshti and Kenobi were the first slaves to be put on offer, and Queen Scintel ordered Skywalker to torture Kenobi with a shock whip before the eyes of the assembled bidders. Once Skywalker entered the arena however, he signaled to R2-D2, who launched Kenobi's, Skywalker's, and Tano's lightsabers to their owners, while Rex aided them with a blaster. Despite their efforts, however, the whole team was soon captured and separated. While Skywalker and Tano were kept in Zygerria, Kenobi, Rex and Roshti were taken to [[Kadavo]], where the rest of the Kiros colonist were kept. There, the Jedi General was forced into submission by the center’s warden, [[Agruss]], who emphasized his point by dropping several Togrutan prisoners to their deaths and threatening to do worse to the others, should Obi-Wan ever think of rebellion.<ref name="Slaves of the Republic" />

[[File:RexTogrutasKadavo.png|thumb|right|220px|Kenobi and Rex during their enslavement on Kadavo.]]
On Kadavo, Kenobi and Rex was soon forced into working in the mines, where he had a hard time scrounging up any spark of hope for himself or the unfortunate prisoners, since every time he did so, one of the Togrutans was punished in his place in order to heighten his despair. Following the Queen's death at the hands of Dooku and her last words telling Skywalker where Kenobi was, Kenobi was part of a conference with Count Dooku in the facility control room. Despite Dooku's wish to execute Kenobi, Skywalker arrived to Kadavo with Jedi reinforcements. During the [[Battle of Kadavo|battle]] that ensued, Kenobi and Rex fought in the room, killed Agruss and escaped the facility, while Tano and troopers rescued the Togruta prisoners before the Republic forces destroyed the labor facility.<ref name="Escape from Kadavo">{{TCW|Escape from Kadavo}}</ref>

====Palpatine kidnapped====
{{Quote|How do I look?''"<br />"''Like a criminal. Should buy you all the credibility you need in prison.|Obi-Wan Kenobi and Mace Windu|Deception}}
Following [[Moralo Eval]]'s capture by the Republic and his imprisonment in the [[Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center]], Kenobi became part of a plot with Yoda and Mace Windu to stop Eval's machinations to kidnap Chancellor Palpatine. To do so, he allowed himself to be shot by a [[sniper]], [[Rako Hardeen]], in front of Skywalker and Tano, who then believed him to be dead.<ref name="Deception">{{TCW|Deception}}</ref>

[[File:TheGreatEscape-D.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Kenobi, disguised as Rako Hardeen, escaping with Moralo Eval and Cad Bane.]]
Following his [[Funeral of Obi-Wan Kenobi|funeral]], Kenobi assumed the identity of his apparent killer and had his physical appearance [[Facial transformation program|altered]]. In addition, once Kenobi and Windu recorded a sample of Hardeen's voice in [[Trueping's]], Kenobi swallowed a [[vocal emulator]] to perfectly disguise his voice as Hardeen's. Kenobi would operate under the alias "Ben" for the duration of the mission. Kenobi was then sent to the detention center, where he formed a partnership with Eval, who trusted Kenobi and thought he could be useful, and Cad Bane, who did not. When a [[Riot at the Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center|prison riot]] started, the trio was able to break out and leave Coruscant for Nal Hutta.<ref name="Deception" />

When they arrived at Nal Hutta, Kenobi crashed their ship in order to cover their trail. The trio then proceeded to try to find supplies and a new ship in [[Bilbousa]], and Bane grew even more distrustful of Kenobi after Kenobi's kind treatment of [[Pablo]], the owner of the [[Pablo's pawnshop|pawnshop]] that the trio went to. Kenobi, suspecting betrayal, planted a tracking device on the new ship he bought, so that when Bane left Kenobi to be arrested by the local authorities, the Jedi turned the frequency of the tracking device over to his captors, who shot Bane and Eval's ship down. Kenobi, meanwhile, escaped from captivity and purchased another ship, and when Bane and Eval found him smugly waiting for them, they agreed to make him a partner in their scheme. When the trio reached [[Orondia]], Skywalker and Tano caught up with them. During a small [[Showdown on Orondia|confrontation]], Kenobi wrestled with Skywalker, whispering "Anakin, don't follow me." just before knocking him unconscious and escaping with Bane and Eval.<ref name="Friends and Enemies">{{TCW|Friends and Enemies}}</ref>

[[File:Task4Sharpshooting-TB.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Kenobi demonstrates his shooting skills in the fourth task.]]
Eval, Bane, and Kenobi then traveled to [[Serenno]] to meet with Count Dooku, and Bane and Kenobi accepted an invitation to participate along with eleven other notorious bounty hunters in a [[Tournament on Serenno|test of skill]] designed by Eval called the [[Box]]. "Hardeen" surpassed Eval's tests, the [[Phindian]] grew angrier with him for his continued success. In the fourth and final test, their shooting skills would be tested, with the bounty hunters's target being a moving spot on the wall. If they missed, they would fall into a floor of flame emitters. After [[Sixtat]] failed, Kenobi stepped in to shoot the target. However, Eval had laid a trap for Kenobi, as his rifle ran out of shots before he could he could hit the last moving spot. However, when the platform dropped beneath him, Bane, disliking Eval's unfair tactics, shot Kenobi a rope and pulled him up. Dooku decided that Eval should not be exempted from the contest and dropped him to the now extinguished floor to fight with Kenobi. Though the Count wanted him to kill Eval, Kenobi refrained, disappointing the Sith lord, who then chose to put Bane in charge of the operation to kidnap the Chancellor.<ref name="The Box">{{TCW|The Box}}</ref>

[[File:Dooku and his team of BHs.jpg|thumb|left|230px|"Hardeen" as part of Dooku's team of bounty hunters.]]
Planning to abduct Palpatine during the [[Festival of Light]] on Naboo, the team commandeered a warehouse in Theed and each member of the team was assigned a role, with Kenobi being given the job of the sniper who would fire [[stun]] blasts at the Chancellor. When he was in position, Kenobi contacted Windu to tell him what he knew of the plan. Later that night, despite Skywalker and Windu's efforts during the [[Skirmish in Theed|skirmish]], the Chancellor was kidnapped by Bane and Eval. Kenobi followed them with Windu and Skywalker close behind, and the criminal pair was arrested and the Chancellor recovered when they stopped at the rendezvous point.<ref name="Crisis on Naboo">{{TCW|Crisis on Naboo}}</ref>

However, he agreed on Skywalker's doubts about knowing the full truth, and returned to the apartment where he had had his position as a sniper, and discovered an activated comlink in his rifle case. Realizing Dooku's hand in it, Kenobi rushed back to the Royal Palace, where he discovered Skywalker dueling with Dooku, while Palpatine was held by a [[IG-100 MagnaGuard|MagnaGuard]]. Kenobi rescued the Chancellor and Dooku fled, and Palpatine thanked the Jedi for their bravery.<ref name="Crisis on Naboo" />

====Maul's return====
{{Quote|You know, when I cut you in half, I should have aimed for your neck instead.|Obi-Wan Kenobi to Maul|Revenge (episode)}}
Like Master Yoda and Skywalker, Kenobi sensed a [[disturbance in the Force]]<ref name="Brothers">{{TCW|Brothers}}</ref>, one that signaled the return of his old enemy, Darth Maul, whom he believed to have killed on Naboo, only to have survived and make his way to a dump in [[Lotho Minor]]. Rescued by Savage Oppress and his sanity restored by Mother Talzin, Maul sent a message to the Jedi Council and lured Kenobi to [[Raydonia]].<ref name="Revenge">{{TCW|Revenge (episode)|Revenge}}</ref>

[[File:MaulVsKenobi-Revenge.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Kenobi facing a vengeful Darth Maul.]]
Though the Jedi Master was unsure if Maul was who he claimed to be, the Dathomirian proved it by telling him about their shared experience at the Battle of Naboo. The two engaged in a [[Skirmish above Raydonia|fight]] where Opress helped Maul knock the Jedi Master out. Kenobi was then brought aboard the [[Goji-DF|brother's ship]], who intended to have the Jedi awake so that his death would be as painful as the last ten years of his life had been. However, Kenobi was rescued by Asajj Ventress, who was trying to collect the bounty on Savage Opress' head. Though he almost gave in to rage, Kenobi gained the upper hand with the help of Ventress and together, they managed to trap Maul and Opress in the back of the ship, leaving the brothers stranded, but alive, in space.<ref name="Revenge" />

====Onderon====
{{Quote|Now, to be clear, we are not here to fight your war; rather, to show you how to conduct it in the most efficient and successful way possible.|Obi-Wan Kenobi|A War on Two Fronts}}
Kenobi attended a session of the Jedi Council when [[Onderon rebels|rebels]] [[Saw Gerrera]] and [[Lux Bonteri]] contacted them with a request for assistance in their [[Onderonian Civil War|struggle]] against the Separatist forces on [[Onderon]], led by King [[Sanjay Rash]]. Kenobi pointed out that at the beginning of the war, Onderon made their intentions to join the Separatists, but Gerrera said that their [[Ramsis Dendup|true king]] was silenced by the fake. The Council refused to help, but did consent to send advisers to train and advise them. Kenobi went there with Skywalker, Tano and Rex.<ref name="A War on Two Fronts">{{TCW|A War on Two Fronts}}</ref>

On Onderon, Kenobi met the rebels and their charismatic leader [[Steela Gerrera]] – alongside his friends and together, they began to train the rebels in combat. When the Separatists discovered their outpost and attacked, Kenobi and his fellow Jedi assisted in battle, though cautious not to be in the thick of the battle. When the skirmish concluded, a strategy was devised to get into the capital city of [[Iziz]].<ref name="A War on Two Fronts" /> Once in there, Kenobi, Skywalker and Rex decided to leave for Coruscant to report to the Council, leaving Tano as a liaison to the rebels. However, they decided to ensure that Tano did not reveal her Jedi identity, though allowing her to accompany the rebels on strike.<ref name="Front Runners">{{TCW|Front Runners}}</ref> After that, they kept in frequent communication with her.<ref name="Front Runners" /><ref name="The Soft War">{{TCW|The Soft War}}</ref><ref name="Tipping Points">{{TCW|Tipping Points}}</ref> Kenobi attended the [[Funeral of Steela Gerrera|funeral]] service for Steela after the final battle after she had perished.<ref name="Tipping Points" />

====Younglings in trouble====
{{Quote|For now, be proud. You have survived an ordeal few your age could. Welcome home, young Jedi.|Obi-Wan Kenobi|A Necessary Bond}}
While Obi-Wan Kenobi was stationed aboard his flagship, the Star Destroyer ''Negotiator'', he was contacted by Jedi initiates aboard the [[transport]] ''[[Crucible]]'', who informed him that their guardian, Ahsoka Tano, had been kidnapped by Hondo Ohnaka's pirates. The younglings said they wanted to rescue Tano from the pirates, but Kenobi told them to stay on the ''Crucible'' for their safety.<ref name="Bound for Rescue">{{TCW|Bound for Rescue}}</ref>

[[File:YoullRegretThat-BFR.png|thumb|230px|left|Kenobi faces off with Grievous in the ''Negotiator'' hangar.]]
Kenobi was intending to send Commander Cody to rescue the stranded Jedi, but his plans were interrupted by an unforeseen [[Attack on Obi-Wan Kenobi's fleet|attack]] by General Grievous on his fleet. Grievous's ships quickly gained the upper hand on Kenobi's, destroying several of his vessels. Upon learning that Grievous had sent a boarding party to board his ship, Kenobi and the clone forces on the ship stationed themselves in the hanger in order to repel it. Grievous himself accompanied the boarding party, and Kenobi began dueling with him as the clone troopers and battle droids engaged each other. Soon, however, Kenobi realized that this was a battle that he could not win, and as he retreated through the passageways of the Star Destroyer he ordered the crew to abandon ship and initiated the ship's [[Self-destruct mechanism|self-destruct sequence]]. When Grievous arrived on the bridge, he found a hologram recording of Kenobi. Through it, Kenobi conceded the victory to Grievous but informed him that the ship was about to explode. Kenobi escaped the destruction on an escape pod, as did Grievous, who evacuated Kenobi's ship on a shuttle just before it exploded.<ref name="Bound for Rescue" />

Soon after, Kenobi joined Tano, the younglings, who had gone to [[Rescue on Florrum|rescue]] Tano despite Kenobi's orders,<ref name="Bound for Rescue" /> and members of the pirate gang, including Ohnaka himself. After Grievous's defeat of Kenobi, he had [[Battle on Florrum|attacked]] the pirates' stronghold, and the Jedi and pirates had joined forces against Grievous and barely escaped with their lives.<ref name="A Necessary Bond">{{TCW|A Necessary Bond}}</ref>

====Mission to Bray====
Kenobi, along with Master Galia, Commander Cody, and several troops went to Bray in response to a cry for help. Upon their arrival, the inhabitants told Kenobi about [[Dark Lord]] that was plaguing their village was desecrating the [[Citadel of Light]]. Kenobi was skeptical of the natives claims until the power went out and came under attack by several [[Mynock]]s. Kenobi and Galia decided to investigate the Citadel. They then discovered that the Mynock had affected trooper [[Peel]] and transformed into a [[Unidentified species (Ravna)|creature]]. Kenobi came under attack by Peel until Cody stunned him and locked him away.<ref name="Count Dooku: Prince of Darkness!">''[[Tales from Vader's Castle 2: Count Dooku: Prince of Darkness!]]''</ref>

Kenobi, along with Galia, entered the Citadel to find a cure. Inside, they found Dooku and the Dark Lord [[Ravna]]. Kenobi attempted to use his lightsaber on Ravna to no avail. Ravna was able to subdue Kenobi, while Dooku use his [[Force lightning|lightning]] to subdue Galia. Kenobi tried to convince Dooku not to use Ravna's powers. However, Ravna betrayed and affected Dooku. Kenobi, was able to break through to Dooku by making him give into his anger and make him attack Ravna. As Dooku used his lightning on Ravna, Kenobi and Galia were able to use the force to collapse the Citadel and entomb Ravna.<ref name="Count Dooku: Prince of Darkness!" />

====Mandalore's fall====
{{Quote|You can kill me, but you will never destroy me. It takes strength to resist the dark side. Only the weak embrace it.|Obi-Wan Kenobi, to Darth Maul|The Lawless}}
When the two brothers [[Raid on the Cybloc transfer station|attacked]] [[Cybloc transfer station]] in the [[Meridian sector]], the [[space station]] sent out a [[distress signal]], leading Kenobi and Adi Gallia there to investigate about the two brothers, who were now operating under [[Rule of Two|Maul's singular vision]]. The Jedi learned they were headed to [[Florrum]]. There, Kenobi contacted Hondo Ohnaka to inquire about the situation, who said that "two horned men" had showed up and threatened to attack his stronghold with pirates who had betrayed him. Kenobi told him he was unable help him with his men, but that he could help stop the [[Sith]].<ref name="Revival">{{TCW|Revival (episode)|Revival}}</ref>

[[File:TwoOnWan-Revival.png|thumb|230px|right|Obi-Wan Kenobi fights Darth Maul and Savage Opress]]
Kenobi and Gallia managed to engage Maul and Opress just as they began their [[Skirmish on Florrum|attack]] on Florrum. As the fight progressed, Gallia was slain by Opress and, after taking up his fallen comrade's lightsaber to help defend himself, Kenobi was forced to retreat and reunite with Onhaka. Inside a cave, Ohnaka decided to ambush the men while Kenobi decided to confront Maul and Opress. With great skill and Gallia's lightsaber, Kenobi violently fought the pair, changing to Ataru and demonstrating mastery of his former fighting style. Eventually, he injures Opress' knee and cuts his left arm off. However, before Kenobi could continue the fight, Maul Force-pushed him into another part of the cave, bringing the fight to an end. Realizing their plan had failed, the Dathomirans left and headed off-planet to try again another time. Their ship, however, was shot down and the two were forced to head for an escape pod. As the ship fell, Kenobi went with Hondo to see "what riches [had] fallen from the sky," but there were no signs of Maul nor Opress, leaving Kenobi to doubt their demise.<ref name="Revival" />

Following the confrontation, Kenobi returned to Coruscant where he explained to Chancellor Palpatine about the situation regarding Darth Maul, but Palpatine dismissed the Maul's threat, saying that the Jedi needed to focus on the Separatist threat, despite Kenobi's fears of the criminal underworld being a place where Maul could flourish.<ref name="Revival" />

Following Maul's [[Takeover of Mandalore|takeover]] of Mandalore, Kenobi was summoned to meet with Yoda and Ki-Adi-Mundi in the communications room. The two showed him a transmission that had been sent by Satine Kryze from Mandalore. In the message, she stated that her government had been overthrown by [[Shadow Collective|rogue criminals]], only for the transmission to be abruptly cut. Despite Yoda and Mundi's reluctance to take part in the internal affairs of Mandalore, Kenobi borrowed the ''[[Twilight]]'' from Skywalker and headed to Sundari. Once on the planet, he tricked a [[Mandalorian super commando|guard]] and took his [[Mandalorian armor|armor]].<ref name="The Lawless">{{TCW|The Lawless}}</ref>

[[File:HoldMeObiWanKenobi-TL.png|thumb|230px|left|Satine Kryze dying in the arms of Kenobi.]]
Disguised, he freed Kryze from the prison and managed to get all the way to the faulty ship. Realizing that he has arrived, Maul personally hunted down Kenobi and managed to ensure that the ''Twilight'' was shot down before it could leave. After the Jedi jumped from the doomed ship, Maul captured the now-dizzy Kenobi as Opress lifted an unconscious Kryze, and ordered them taken back to the [[Sundari Royal Palace|royal palace]].<ref name="The Lawless" />

Maul, realizing Kenobi's feelings for Satine, decided to execute her with Kenobi watching hoping that he would feel the same pain Maul did when he was forced to live in exile after being brutally injured by Kenobi on Naboo. Maul again attempted to sway Kenobi to the darkside, but the Jedi Master refused. Angered by the comment, as the commandos forced Kenobi to his knees, Maul let Satine go, but stabbed her with the darksaber. She ultimately died in Obi-Wan's arms saying with her last breath, that she always loved him and always would. Maul, then, had his guards escort Kenobi to a cell where he could "drown in his misery" and "rot."<ref name="The Lawless" />

[[File:BoKatanFreesKenobi-TL.png|thumb|right|261x261px|Kenobi freed by Bo-Katan.]]
[[Bo-Katan Kryze|Bo-Katan]] and her renegade [[Nite Owls]] team, however, intercepted Kenobi as he was being transferred to the prison area. Katan freed Kenobi, and had him help her find Maul and kill him. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to them, Darth Sidious appeared and engaged Maul and Opress in a duel, defeating the former and killing the latter. As the [[Mandalorian civil war (Clone Wars)|conflict]] escalated, Kenobi made his way to his ship and was told by Bo-Katan to warn the Republic of what had happened. Kenobi told her that it would lead to an invasion of Mandalore, but she said that Maul's death would be worth it, and that they would survive. Kenobi, before leaving, asked Bo-Katan if Satine was her sister, and apologized for her loss.<ref name="The Lawless" />

====A Jedi's trial====
{{Quote|Surely we cannot do what Tarkin suggests. We need to stand together with Ahsoka.|Obi-Wan Kenobi|The Wrong Jedi}}
Following the [[Bombing of the Jedi Temple hangar|bombing]] at the Jedi Temple, Kenobi took part of the Jedi Council meeting in which Yoda and Windu requested that Skywalker and Tano investigate the incident and find the culprit, telling to suspect even their fellow Jedi. When Tano and Skywalker told the Council of their progress―following a clue that led them to [[Jackar Bowmani]], Kenobi was present again as a [[hologram]].<ref name="Sabotage">{{TCW|Sabotage (episode)|Sabotage}}</ref> Kenobi also attended to the [[Funeral of the Jedi Temple bombing victims|funeral for the victims]] of the bombing.<ref name="TJWKTM">{{TCW|The Jedi Who Knew Too Much}}</ref>

[[File:ChamberOfJudgement-TWJ.png|thumb|left|310x310px|Kenobi as part of the Council of Judgement.]]
Later on, Kenobi was made aware of a Separatist attack on Saleucami. To alert his fellow Jedi in the Jedi Temple's war room, and held a conference where he was suggested for their fleets to move to the [[Anoat system]] and move across to Saleucami, when he was interrupted by Admiral Tarkin, who told the Council that Tano was requested by [[Letta Turmond]].<ref name="TJWKTM" />

Following Tano's [[Escape from the Republic military base|escape]] from authorities to prove her innocence, Kenobi along with the rest of the Jedi High Council, and Skywalker, held a emergency meeting with Tarkin declaring to them that Tano was now accused of [[Treason|sedition]]. With Skywalker and Plo Koon doubtful of her guilt, Grand Master Yoda sent the two to find her, but Windu attempted to have Skywalker left out of the matter, believing having him involved would only making things worse due to his emotional bond with Tano. However, Kenobi convinced the Council otherwise, stating Skywalker knew Tano best and that it would be foolish to take him off the mission.<ref name="To Catch a Jedi">{{TCW|To Catch a Jedi}}</ref>

After her [[Capture of Ahsoka Tano|capture]], Kenobi listened to Tarkin as he informed the Council that the Senate requested for Tano to be expelled from the Jedi Order and turned over to the Republic military so she could receive more "impartial" judgement. Kenobi tried to convince his fellow Council members that they should side with Tano, but they all refused to do so, as they feared that protecting Tano would damage their ties with the Senate. Despite his reluctance to hand Tano over to the Republic, Kenobi took part of Tano's trial in the [[Chamber of Judgment]], where the Council stripped the young Togruta of her rank and status as a Jedi.<ref name="The Wrong Jedi">{{TCW|The Wrong Jedi}}</ref>

Like other members of the Council, Kenobi was present during Tano's military [[Trial of Ahsoka Tano|trial]] as presided over by Chancellor Palpatine and during Barriss Offee's confession, which confirmed Tano's innocence. Along with the Council, Kenobi agreed that Tano should rejoin the Order and was present when Windu and Yoda proclaimed her to be a true Jedi, worthy of becoming a Jedi Knight, only for her to refuse readmission. When Skywalker ran after Tano, Kenobi started to follow, but Plo Koon placed a hand on his shoulder, silently advising him not to. Despite Skywalker's attempts to convince her to reconsider, Tano parted with the Jedi.<ref name="The Wrong Jedi" />

====Kaminoan conspiracy====
{{Quote|The clone in question is now dead, and the Jedi still suspect nothing.|Count Dooku, to Darth Sidious|Orders}}
After one of Skywalker's clone troopers, [[CT-5385|Tup]], murdered Jedi General [[Tiplar]] during a [[Battle of Ringo Vinda|battle]] on [[Ringo Vinda]] and had been sent to Kamino for examination<ref name="The Unknown">{{TCW|The Unknown}}</ref>, [[Shaak Ti]] held a meeting with the Jedi Council, of which Kenobi took part of. Between her wanting an atomic brain scan on Tup and Nala Se wanting to terminate the clone and do an autopsy, Kenobi asked what did the Kaminoan thought of her and advised her that Tup be brought back to the Jedi Temple where he would be examined through the Force.<ref name="Conspiracy">{{TCW|Conspiracy}}</ref> However, the full extent of the Kaminoans' plot was only revealed to [[CT-5555|Fives]], who died before he could warn the Jedi of [[Order 66]].<ref>{{TCW|Fugitive}}</ref><ref>{{TCW|Orders}}</ref>

====Clovis returns====
{{Quote|Anakin, I understand to a degree what is going on. You've met Satine. You know I once harbored feelings for her. It's not that we're not allowed to have these feelings.

As a Jedi, it is essential you make the right choice, Anakin, for the Order.|Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker|The Rise of Clovis}}
Following Senator Amidala's [[Mission to Scipio|mission]] to [[Scipio]] where she cooperated with Rush Clovis to expose the [[InterGalactic Banking Clan]]<ref>{{TCW|An Old Friend}}</ref> and Skywalker's continuous demonstrations of animosity towards Clovis, Kenobi visited Skywalker to discuss his and Yoda's concerns that his judgment regarding Clovis were "clouded" after the [[Mission to Cato Neimoidia|event]] on [[Cato Neimoidia]]. Kenobi told Skywalker that he could not let his feelings for Amidala get in the way of his judgement.<ref name="The Rise of Clovis">{{TCW|The Rise of Clovis}}</ref> Nevertheless, Skywalker was right to distrust Clovis, as his actions not only endangered Senator Amidala's life once again, but also put the Banking Clan under the direct control of Chancellor Palpatine, thus giving Darth Sidious more power in his quest to form a [[New Order]].<ref>{{TCW|Crisis at the Heart}}</ref>

====Sifo-Dyas' secret====
{{Quote|The creation of the clone army, kept secret from us Sifo-Dyas did. How this was done we know not, yet now a new piece of the puzzle we have. Perhaps clarity it will bring us, yes.|Yoda|The Lost One}}
After Jedi Master Plo Koon intercepted a distress call from a shuttle once thought to have been lost and discovered Sifo-Dyas's lightsaber, he took of the meeting in which Plo Koon informed the Jedi Council of his findings, and Kenobi reminded them that Sifo-Dyas had spearheaded the creation of the Clone Army. Relaunching the investigation of the Jedi Master's death, Kenobi and Skywalker were sent to Felucia to find out what happened to Sifo-Dyas, where they spoke to the tribal leaders. Kenobi was told that the Felucians had cremated his body and that a another Jedi had been with him when he was killed, and reported their findings to Master Yoda.<ref name="The Lost One">{{TCW|The Lost One}}</ref>

[[File:EpGuide610.png|thumb|220px|right|Kenobi and Skywalker's meeting with the leader of the Pyke Syndicate.]]
The two were then [[Mission to Oba Diah (Clone Wars)|sent]] to [[Oba Diah]] when former Chancellor, Finis Valorum told Yoda that Sifo-Dyas had been [[Mission to Oba Diah (pre–Naboo Crisis)|sent]] to negotiate with the [[Pyke Syndicate]] to stop an underground war. Valorum, however, said that there was no other Jedi sent alongside Syfo-Dyas, but rather his personal aide [[Silman]]. On Oba Diah, Kenobi and Skywalker met [[Lom Pyke]], who denied any involvement until Kenobi noticed that he was wearing the crest of Valorum and Skywalker grabbed the necklace and told the [[Pyke]] to "stop playing games." Lom finally complied with the Jedi, and told them that they had been paid by a man called Tyranus to shoot Sifo-Dyas's shuttle down. However, as they feared that anyone who paid for the death of a Jedi was dangerous, they kept Silman locked away for ten years as insurance.<ref name="The Lost One" />

However, once they met Silman, they realized he had gone mad after being locked up for so long, and were unable to learn much from him as Dooku arrived to kill him before Kenobi and Skywalker's eyes. After engaging Dooku in combat, they learned that the man called Tyranus was, in fact, the Count. After he managed to escape, they informed the Council of their findings, only for them to question why Dooku had been behind the creation of the clone army, and what the game of the yet-unidentified [[Dark Lord of the Sith]] was.<ref name="The Lost One" />

====Yoda's journey====
{{Quote|Yet, open to us, a path remains that unknown to the Sith is. Through this path, victory we may yet find. Not victory in the Clone Wars but victory for all time.|Yoda, to Mace Windu and Obi-Wan Kenobi|Sacrifice}}
[[File:EpGuide611.png|thumb|left|230px|Yoda conferring with the High Council, including Kenobi.]]
During a meeting with the High Council, Kenobi like the rest of his peers noticed Grand Master Yoda's absent-mindedness following his communion with Kenobi's late master, Qui-Gon Jinn. Later, Windu conferred in private with Kenobi that he was worried about Yoda's turmoil and asked him to keep an eye on the old Jedi Master. Soon, however, Yoda revealed to the Council in full that a voice spoke to him from beyond, prompting Kenobi and the entire Council to perform a joint [[meditation]] with him, but they heard nothing. Though Master Mundi surmised it could be a deception by the Sith, but Kenobi dismissed the idea, believing Yoda could not be susceptible to such manipulation, but Windu replied that, even as wise and old as he was, Yoda was not beyond the corruption of the dark side.<ref name="Voices">{{TCW|Voices}}</ref>

Submitting himself for medical examination, Kenobi, Windu and Mundi were told by [[Rig Nema]] that Yoda was in perfect mental health, even if he approached nine hundredth year of life. Though Mundi suggested the Dark Lord of the Sith could be using Yoda's connection to Dooku, Kenobi vehemently rejected the idea, saying they all had been apprenticed to Yoda at one point or another. Before the discussion could go on, Nema then suggested a [[deprivation ritual]] for Yoda to reach Jinn's voice. During the procedure, Kenobi, Skywalker, Mundi and Plo Koon watched over the small Jedi, Yoda managed to hear Jinn's instruction to go to the [[Dagobah system]] before Kenobi noticed his vital signs were dropping too low and stopped the test. When asked about the procedure by Windu, Kenobi told him Yoda was sure he had contacted the dead and, like most, he was in disbelief about the whole ordeal, only for Windu to place guards to keep an eye on Yoda and the small Jedi Master to escape with Skywalker's help and R2-D2's company, willing to go on a journey that would take him to [[Dagobah]], [[Wellspring of Life|a mysterious planet]] and [[Moraband]].<ref name="Voices" /><ref name="Destiny">{{TCW|Destiny (episode)|Destiny}}</ref><ref name="Sacrifice">{{TCW|Sacrifice}}</ref>

On Yoda's return to Coruscant, Kenobi and Windu greeted him, and Windu asked him if he had gained some insight on how to win the war, but the old Jedi Master told them that he no longer believed that the Jedi could win the Clone Wars but that, through hope and perseverance, the Jedi would ultimately triumph over the Sith.<ref name="Sacrifice" />

====Utapau's crystal crisis====
{{Quote|How well would you sleep, knowing that I failed you?''"<br />"''Not very well, I imagine. Luckily, that isn't true, and never will be.|Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi|In Search of the Crystal}}
During the last months of the war, Kenobi and Skywalker were sent to [[Utapau]] to [[Mission to Utapau|investigate]] the mysterious death of Jedi Master [[Tu-Anh]]. Once they landed on [[Pau City]], they met [[Inspector]] [[Jen June]] who immediately led the [[Pau City Morgue|morgue]] the Jedi's corpse was located. Immediately, the two Jedi examine her body. Soon enough, they went to the place where she had been found, only to determine she had been hit in the optic nerve with a [[Vilmarh's Revenge|precision laser dart]] by a sniper. As they found the sniper's position, they found slime on the floor and interrogated the building's owner, [[Garri]], from whom the two Jedi learned of the involvement of MagnaGuards. Later, they asked Inspector June to analyze the slimy substance; she told them it was the secretion of an [[Amani]]'s skin, and added that the Governor [[Torul Blom]] wanted to see them.<ref name="A Death on Utapau">{{TCW|A Death on Utapau}}</ref>

[[File:A Death on Utapau Ep.png|thumb|right|220px|Kenobi and Skywalker speaking to Inspector June.]]
Though the Governor asked them to leave Utapau, Kenobi and Skywalker persevered and rented two [[dactillion]]s to go to the city's lower levels and talk to the leader of an Amani tribe there. Told that an Amani outcast had been seen entering a cave not far from there, Kenobi thanked him, and he and Skywalker went to the cave, where they found the MagnaGuards, leading them to suspect of a Separatist conspiracy. Despite some resistance, they managed to get information from the droids that showed them the involvement of the [[Sugi]] and went to see Inspector June once again. After she identified the Amani as coming from the plain, Kenobi contacted the Council to inform them of their findings and later attended together with Skywalker, attended the [[Funeral of Tu-Anh|funeral]] of Tu-Anh.<ref name="A Death on Utapau" />

Soon after, they reached the Amani settlement they had been looking for, only for their dactillions to be killed and for the Amani to scatter in every direction during the ensuing confrontation, leaving Skywalker and Kenobi to follow the tracks of one that appeared to be their leader. During the hunt, Skywalker mentioned Tano for the first time since her departure, and Kenobi asked if he wanted to talk about it, yet Skywalker refused. Kenobi then suggested for them to set up a camp and rest. However, he insisted on the subject, prompting Skywalker to tell Kenobi he missed Tano and to voice his anger at the High Council for turning its back on her. In response, Kenobi asserted that it had been Tano's decision to leave, and that she had allowed her emotions to cloud her judgement, something against the Jedi way. Then, Kenobi suggested him to rest, but Skywalker declined so that he could keep the first watch. Finally, he questioned Kenobi on what would happen if he had turned out to be a "major disappointment," but Kenobi wanted to believe it would never happen.<ref name="In Search of the Crystal">{{TCW|In Search of the Crystal}}</ref>

[[File:Crystal Crisis Ep.png|thumb|left|230px|Kenobi and Skywalker defending a massive kyber crystal.]]
However, they both fell asleep and were captured by a group of Sugis led by [[Chong]], who brought them before [[Endente]] as Kenobi told Chong of their "intention" to buy weapons. However, they learned Endente was, in fact, selling a [[kyber crystal]] and Skywalker prompted him to show it before they made the deal. The two Jedi were then brought to the starship where the crystal was being kept and escaped from their captors. Once Skywalker took out all the Sugi and recovered their lightsabers from Chong, they were unable to capture Endente and discovered the massive kyber crystal inside the ship.<ref name="In Search of the Crystal" /> Despite being attacked, the two Jedi managed to transport the crystal through Utapau's plains until they reached Pau City, where Governor Blom showed them his true colors and had the two Jedi surrounded with his men and Grievous's droids. As the kyber crystal was loaded into a shuttle and sent to ship on orbit, Kenobi and Skywalker took June and Blom as hostages, so that their underlings stopped shooting at them, and stole a [[freighter]] to recover the crystal.<ref name="Crystal Crisis">{{TCW|Crystal Crisis}}</ref>

[[File:Big Bang Ep.png|thumb|right|220px|Kenobi and Skywalker planning to escape.]]
During the persecution, Kenobi contacted the High Council to inform them of their current course of action, and Grievous soon damaged their ship, forcing them to crash the ship to damage the hyperdrive and board the ship where the crystal was then held. However, they got separated, and Kenobi landed in a [[hangar]] full of droids, where he was soon confronted and captured by Grievous. Following Dooku's orders to execute him, Kenobi was being escorted to the execution room until Skywalker rescued him. Together, their made their way to the kyber crystal at the vault, where they were temporarily trapped until a squad discovered them. Using the crystal and the Force to knock them out, he managed to get to a hangar where Skywalker got a shuttle for them to escape. Meanwhile, Kenobi set several [[Armored Assault Tank|AATs]] to shoot and overload the crystal, destroying the crystal and the ship, and escaping from the explosion in the nick of time.<ref name="The Big Bang" />

Back on Coruscant, Kenobi and Skywalker reported to the Council about the outcome of their mission, when Yoda told them of the use of kyber crystals on weapons of unimaginable power in ancient times.<ref name="The Big Bang" />

====Anaxes====
{{Quote|From Anakin I expect this type for authority.|Obi-Wan Kenobi|A Distant Echo}}
With mounting losses on the Republic side in the [[Battle for Anaxes|battle for]] [[Anaxes]] and Captain Rex’s successful mission to a Separatist [[cyber center]] with the assistance of [[Clone Force 99]] to discover if General Trench was in possession of Rex's [[Rex's strategy algorithm|algorithm]]<ref name="The Bad Batch">{{TCW|The Bad Batch}}</ref>, Kenobi was present when Rex proposed a [[Mission to Skako Minor|rescue mission]] to [[Skako Minor]] to the Jedi Council and subsequently rejected. Sometime later, Kenobi suspected Skywalker of attempting to go forward with the mission, and confronted him, Echo and [[Hunter]]. To Kenobi's surprise, Rex revealed the mission to be his plan, and that it was more than a simple rescue mission for the Separatists had his algorithm. Seeing their determination, Kenobi allowed them to go, saying "[[May the Force be with you]]".<ref name="A Distant Echo">{{TCW|A Distant Echo}}</ref>

After their success, Kenobi took part on Windu's debriefing on the strategy to take the [[Anaxes assembly complex|Separatist assembly complex]] by air, when Echo posed his plan to be escorted by the Bad Batch into Trench's new comm vault on a [[Providence-class dreadnought|dreadnought]] on the planet's orbit and plug himself to feed the Separatist's strategic movements. Kenobi took part on the assault and the combined efforts managed to take the complex under their control and, with all other fronts falling to the Republic, Trench initiated a countdown for an explosion that could destroy most of Anaxes. While Windu deactivated the bomb, Kenobi assisted in the evacuation efforts; with Trench's death at the hands of Skywalker and his fleet's destruction, Windu, Kenobi and Skywalker handed medals to the heroes of the campaign: Captain Rex, Corporal Echo and the "Bad Batch".<ref name="Unfinished Business">{{TCW|Unfinished Business}}</ref>

====Vos and Ventress====
{{Quote|You were fighting [[Asajj Ventress|her]] and chatting at the same time?''"<br />"''It's... Banter.''"<br />"''You ''flirted'' with her?''"<br />"''Come now, Vos, you can't tell me you managed to go undercover in all sorts of shady places without flirting yourself.|Quinlan Vos and Obi-Wan Kenobi|Dark Disciple}}
Upon [[Mahranee]]'s [[Attack on Mahranee|fall]] and the destruction of General [[Chubor]]'s refugee-carrier [[Chubor's Republic frigate|Republic frigate]] by Dooku's decision, Kenobi participated in council meeting along with Skywalker, where it was decided to bring about the Count's assassination, for they had reached the conclusion that all that had transpired in the war had been because of Dooku. Though Kenobi was against the idea, he nevertheless suggested Quinlan Vos to be deployed for the mission.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

Once Vos returned to Coruscant from his covert mission in [[Otor's Hub]] after ending [[Sheb Valaad]]'s [[black market]] operation, Kenobi greeted him at the Jedi Temple and accompanied him to the [[Jedi Council Chamber]]. There, Vos was informed of his mission, and Ventress's role in it; Vos accepted. At the end of the session, Kenobi went to Vos' encounter at the dining hall and gave him more details about Ventress's character. Afterwards, Kenobi and Vos would prearrange to meet at a bar in [[Level 1313]] so that Vos would keep him appraised of his progress at regular intervals. Vos' absence in their third and fourth would-be encounters forced Kenobi to report to the Council.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

At one such meeting, Ventress was the one to appear at the bar, after her [[Mission to Serenno (Boba Fett's syndicate)|mission]] to rescue Vos from Serenno after he had been captured following their [[Mission to Raxus|failed attempt]] to kill Dooku, she told Kenobi that they had lost Vos to Dooku and the dark side; the two sat there, together, for a long time. Kenobi would later make mention of their encounter to his fellow Jedi, among them [[Akar-Deshu]].<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

====Maul's trail====
{{Quote|My emotions are under control, Master Tiplee. I will not fail you ''or'' this mission. |Obi-Wan Kenobi|Darth Maul—Son of Dathomir, Part Three}}
Following the [[Battle on Ord Mantell]], Kenobi was sent to [[Ord Mantell]] to investigate who the Separatist forces had been fighting, alongside Jedi Masters [[Tiplee]], Mace Windu and Aayla Secura. Though the Shadow Collective had managed to collect most traces of their presence in the [[Ord Mantell City|city]], [[CC-3636|Wolffe]] and his men uncovered a Mandalorian helmet outside the town, which led the four Jedi on the trail of Maul.<ref name="DM:SoD">''[[Darth Maul—Son of Dathomir, Part Three]]''</ref>

[[File:Assault on Mandalorian supply outpost.png|thumb|left|220px|Kenobi and Tiplee assaulting Maul's hideout.]]
Aware of the [[Black Sun]]'s presence on the system, and the location of [[Vizsla Keep 09]], a Mandalorian supply outpost suspected to be Maul's hideout, Kenobi and Tiplee led an [[Assault on Vizsla Keep 09|assault]] to lock the place down until reinforcements arrived. However, as they tried to reach the command center, Maul and Count Dooku appeared to duel the two Jedi, with Windu and Secura joining them soon afterwards. Despite their advantage over the Sith, Tiplee was killed by Dooku, and a Mandalorian assisted Maul by setting off an explosion that injured Windu and Secura. The Sith, then, managed to escape as Maul told Kenobi not to worry, as they would be seeing each other again soon; his alliance with Dooku leaving the Jedi perplexed as to what had just happened.<ref name="DM:SoD" />

====Vos' rescue====
{{Quote|Ventress is at fault, yes, and of course Dooku. But this, Masters...this one is ''our'' responsibility. We owe Vos the chance to choose again, and, with our help, wisely.|Obi-Wan Kenobi, to the Council|Dark Disciple}}
Upon Akar-Deshu's meeting with Asajj Ventress, Kenobi and Skywalker met with them and Kenobi promised her that she would come to no harm within the Temple, and brought her to the Council chambers. Despite Windu's open disapproval, Yoda allowed Kenobi and Skywalker to go with Ventress to rescue Vos. Soon enough, Kenobi, Skywalker and Ventress were on the cockpit of her ship, the ''[[Banshee (starship)|Banshee]]'', to [[Rescue of Quinlan Vos|infiltrate]] the Separatist dreadnought where Vos, or rather "Admiral Enigma", was issuing orders from.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

Stealthily, the three made their way to the bridge where Skywalker dueled Dooku, while Kenobi and Ventress discovered Vos was still being held captive by the Count. However, Ventress saw through his ruse and tried to relieve Vos from an existence consumed by hatred, but Kenobi convinced her to escape before taking such a drastic action. Barely escaping on the ''Banshee'', they made their way back to Coruscant, and Kenobi saw as the Council welcomed Vos and pardoned Ventress.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

====Fall and redemption====
{{Quote|You misunderstand, Master Windu. All of you. She didn't just save his life. She saved ''Quinlan''. And...I believe she may have saved us.|Obi-Wan Kenobi, on Asajj Ventress|Dark Disciple}}
A month later, Kenobi was sent alongside Skywalker, Vos and Akar-Deshu in a [[Destruction of the Separatist supply storage base|mission]] to take over a [[Separatist supply storage base]] and redistribute the supplies to worlds in need of them. However, their mission went awry when Vos, unbeknownst to them, arranged the base's destruction. Later on, Kenobi and Vos would be [[Destruction of the Vanqor listening post|deployed]] to a [[Vanqor listening post|listening post]] on Vanqor, but their second fruitless campaign in a row made Kenobi suspicious of a leak. He confided his feelings to Yoda and Windu, leading them to suspect Vos was the leak. Kenobi would later be summoned by Yoda to tell him that he had sensed concealed darkness in Vos' soul, and the Council arranged an emergency session, in which they entertained the option of executing Vos'. Kenobi, however, protested against the idea, and suggested sending Vos again to assassinate Dooku to test his allegiances.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

Afterwards, Vos had Ventress tell the Council of the Count and Grievous' [[Second battle of Christophsis|presence]] on Christophsis, and the two set out on their mission aboard the ''Banshee''. Kenobi and Skywalker followed suit and spied on Vos, who reunited with Dooku; they observed as the two dueled, when Vos gained the upper hand just as he let Dooku live as long as he told him about his Master's whereabouts. It was then that Kenobi and Skywalker intervened, taking the pair by surprised, and placed them under arrest. The two soon escaped from the ''[[Vigilance]]'', causing the death of Akar-Deshu and the [[Chagrian]] [[Kav Bayons]], and boarded the ''Banshee'', but Skywalker's quick thinking forced the renegades to crash land on the planet.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

The two Jedi pursued the three injured renegades to a [[Christophsis Separatist tower|Separatist tower]], where they surrounded them, where he and Skywalker witnessed Ventress' last moments. They transported Vos back to Coruscant where the fallen Jedi confessed all his crimes and Kenobi defended Ventress. After being placed under Yoda's supervision for some time, Vos was released to Kenobi's care to take Ventress' body back to Dathomir, where she would be finally reunited with her sisters.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

====Attack on the Jedi temple====
Kenobi was later present at the temple when it was [[Bombing at the Jedi Temple|attacked]] by Separatist general [[Rackham Sear]].

====Coruscant and Utapau====
{{Quote|So uncivilized.|Obi-Wan Kenobi after killing General Grievous with a blaster|Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith}}
[[File:Kenobi-EpIII.jpg|thumb|265x265px|Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi at the end of the Clone Wars.]]
Following Chancellor Palpatine's capture by General Grievous and his full-scale [[Battle of Coruscant|attack]] over the skies of Coruscant, Kenobi and Skywalker returned from the [[Outer Rim Sieges]], where he was with Skywalker at Mandalore, but was called back to Coruscant to lead a mission to rescue the Chancellor before Grievous and his fleet could flee the besieged capital. The two Jedi fought their way through a Separatist blockade and managed to board the ''[[Invisible Hand]]'', only to find the Chancellor being held prisoner at the top of the ship's observation spire. Not long after they arrived to the room, Count Dooku appeared before them and the two Jedi engaged him in a duel.<ref name="Episode III" />

Though Dooku managed to gain the upper hand and knocked Kenobi out cold, Skywalker was able to defeat the Sith Lord, and subsequently executed him at Palpatine's urging. He then rescued Kenobi, carrying him until he woke up when they were hanging in an elevator. As they got out of there and ran through hallway 328, Grievous had them trapped in a ray shield and brought to the ''Invisible Hand''’s control room. The cyborg General personally taunted them, giving R2-D2 enough time to free them and for Kenobi and Skywalker to confront Grievous. The General, however, escaped in an escape pod and forced the two Jedi to pilot the ship and land on Coruscant as safely as they could. Following the ordeal, they escorted the Chancellor to the Senate building, where they separated, with Kenobi going back to Jedi Temple to report to the Council.<ref name="Episode III" />

[[File:Council RotS.png|thumb|300px|left|Kenobi on the Jedi Council.]]
Later, Kenobi attended another meeting, concerning the reports on the Outer Rim sieges, including Saleucami's fall and the move of Quinlan Vos' troops to [[Boz Pity]]. At the end of the session, he met with Skywalker and told him to be careful with Palpatine, and that Palpatine had requested his presence for unknown reasons. Soon enough, Kenobi and the Council were made aware that the Chancellor had Skywalker appointed as his Personal Representative on the Jedi Council; though the Council approved of the appointment, they denied Skywalker the rank of Jedi Master. During the same meeting, Kenobi discussed the importance of [[Kashyyyk]], prompting Master Yoda to assist the [[Wookiee]]s himself.<ref name="Episode III" />

At the end of the meeting, Kenobi acknowledged to Skywalker that his appointment had been accepted so that, on behalf of the Council, Skywalker could spy on the Chancellor, an assignment that Anakin refused to partake in because he believed it to be an act of treason. He tried to convince Anakin that something out of place had to be happening for Palpatine to remain in office long after his two legitimate terms had expired and to have accumulated an unnatural amount of executive powers, but still, Anakin would have none of it. Later, before Yoda's departure to Kashyyyk, Kenobi conferred with Windu and Yoda of Skywalker's reluctant compliance on his task, when he heard of Windu's distrust of the Jedi Knight and Yoda's doubts about the prophecy of the "Chosen One."<ref name="Episode III" />

[[File:Obiwanshoots.png|thumb|right|300px|Kenobi shoots Grievous with his own blaster.]]
Following the Chancellor's disclosure of General Grievous' location on Utapau to Skywalker, who then passed it onto the Council, Kenobi was sent to capture the fugitive General. Before parting, though, Skywalker apologized to Kenobi, who told him that he needed patience and that he would soon become a master. The two exchanged goodbyes in what would be their last meeting as allies. (though neither of them were aware of this.)

Then, the Jedi Master departed for Utapau, where he managed to sneak up on the Separatists with help of a [[varactyl]], [[Boga]], and confront Grievous personally. The cyborg then challenged Kenobi in lightsaber combat, but the Jedi managed to cut two of Grievous' arms; the General gained the upper hand until Kenobi's battalion arrived and [[Battle of Utapau|engaged]] the droids protecting Grievous. As battle intensified, Grievous escaped, with Kenobi chasing him—at the cost of losing his lightsaber temporarily—to a landing platform where he finally killed Grievous by partially tearing open a hole in his armor and shooting at his insides with a [[E-5 blaster rifle|blaster]], igniting his organs and causing him to burn from the inside out. With his long-time rival slain at last, Kenobi headed off to rejoin his troops.<ref name="Episode III" />

====Order 66====
{{Quote|My clone troops turned on me. I need help.|Obi-Wan Kenobi to Bail Organa|Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith}}
Following Windu and other Council member's [[Duel in Palpatine's office|duel]] against Chancellor Palpatine, revealed to be Darth Sidious, and the issue of Order 66, Kenobi met up with Commander Cody and told him to contact the troops to move to the higher levels of the city. The clone then returned him his lightsaber, and Kenobi proceeded to climb with Boga, just as Cody received a direct message from Palpatine, telling him to execute the order. Before Kenobi went too far, Cody ordered his men to shoot at the Jedi Master, bringing his fall to the water below. However, unlike many others, he survived and managed to climb on his own while evading troops, only to discover the attack had been intentional.<ref name="Episode III" />

[[File:Obi-Wan Kenobi and Bail Organa Discuss The Situation.png|thumb|220x220px|left|Kenobi and Bail Organa discussing with Yoda.]]
Taking [[Soulless One|Grievous' starfighter]], he left Utapau and made contact with Senator Bail Organa, who had seen the [[attack on the Jedi Temple]] firsthand and was trying to locate other surviving Jedi. Reuniting on the ''[[Tantive III]]'', Kenobi met with the Senator and Master Yoda, who told him of the retreat message telling all Jedi to return to the Temple, saying that the war was over. Kenobi then suggested to dismantle the signal, so that others wouldn't fall into the trap, and Yoda agreed.<ref name="Episode III" />

On their way to Coruscant, Organa was contacted by [[Vice Chair|Vice Chancellor]] Amedda, who told him of an emergency session to held by the Senate. Kenobi and Yoda entered the Jedi Temple and witnessed with their own eyes the massacre that just taken place. During that, Chancellor Palpatine told the Senate of the Jedi's "sedition" against the Republic and [[Proclamation of the New Order|declared]] the birth of the [[Galactic Empire]].

===Age of the Empire===
====The fallen apprentice====
{{Quote|It can't be. It can't be.|Obi-Wan Kenobi learns that Anakin Skywalker has turned to the Dark Side|Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith}}
At the central security station of the Jedi Temple, Kenobi changed the Jedi recall signal into a holographic message of himself, warning any of the surviving Jedi to stay away from the Temple and the planet, persevere for the future and to trust in the Force.<ref name="Episode III" /><ref name="A New Dawn" /><ref name="Spark of Rebellion">''[[Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion]]''</ref><ref name="Kanan 2">''[[Kanan 2: The Last Padawan, Part II: Flight]]''</ref>

[[File:Shock.png|thumb|200px|right|Kenobi watches a Hologram of his once apprentice with Darth Sidious]]
Desperate for answers and despite Yoda's warning that he would only find pain, Kenobi checked the security recordings to find that Skywalker had led his battalion of clones to attack the Temple, where he fought the Jedi and kneeled to the newly-proclaimed [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]], who was proud of his [[Sith apprentice|apprentice]], now going by a new name—"Vader".<ref name="Episode III" /> Though Kenobi was horrified, Yoda determined that they had to destroy the Sith; Kenobi, however, refused to fight Vader and requested that he be sent to kill the Emperor instead, but Yoda vetoed the idea, claiming that Kenobi wasn't strong enough to go head-to-head with the Emperor on his own. Kenobi expressed that Skywalker was like a brother to him and that he did not have the heart to kill him, yet Yoda explained that the boy he had trained no longer existed and that he needed to be put out of his misery, and told Kenobi to use his instincts to find Vader.

After that, he visited Senator Amidala, thinking she might know of Vader's location. He revealed what he'd discovered about Skywalker's betrayal of the Jedi and how the Clone Wars had been a lie orchestrated by Palpatine. Amidala harshly denounced Kenobi's accusations, believing that he intended to kill him if she revealed where he'd gone. Correctly deducing that Anakin was the father of Amidala's child, he apologized for having to be the one to tell her of these events and left her apartment.<ref name="Episode III" />

====Duel on Mustafar====
{{Quote|You were the Chosen One! It was said that you would ''destroy'' the Sith, not ''join'' them! Bring balance to the Force, not leave it in darkness!"<br>"I HATE YOU!"<br>"You were my brother, Anakin. I ''loved'' you.|Obi-Wan to Anakin after the end of their duel.|Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith}}
Unbeknownst to Amidala, Kenobi stowed away in her star skiff, just as she and C-3PO departed for the [[Mustafar system]] to meet with Vader, who had already [[Mission to Mustafar|killed]] the Separatist leaders taking refuge there. Hiding in one of the compartments, Kenobi emerged from the ship, only for Vader to think she had brought Kenobi to kill him and [[Force choke|choked]] her in a paranoid rage. As Kenobi checked her vital signs, Vader accused him of trying to turn her against him, but the Jedi Master stated that his anger and lust for power had already done that, and that he had allowed Sidious to twist his mind until he became the very thing he had sworn to destroy.<ref name="Episode III" />

[[File:Anakin_vs_Obiwan.jpg|thumb|left|245px|Kenobi fights Vader on Mustafar.]]
Unaffected by the Jedi's "lies" and unafraid of the dark side, Vader claimed that he'd brought peace, freedom, justice, and security to "[his] new Empire", and told Kenobi that if he wasn't on his side, then, he was his enemy. Realizing that his former apprentice was already too far gone to be reasoned with, Kenobi vowed to stop him at all costs, prompting the two to engage in a ferocious [[Duel on Mustafar|duel]] that caused substantial damage to the facility, just as Yoda and the Emperor [[Duel in the Galactic Senate|dueled]] in the Senate. Ultimately, Kenobi and Vader were hovering over the lava sea, when the Jedi Master reflected on his failure while Vader stated that he should have known about the Jedi's lust for power and their evil.<ref name="Episode III" /> Kenobi tried again in vain to convince Vader that Sidious was the evil one, but Vader continued to denounced the Jedi as evil.

Eventually, Kenobi jumped to high ground on the embankment of the lava river, gaining advantage over Vader. Despite Kenobi's warning not to try the jump, the Sith apprentice ignored him and did so anyway, allowing Kenobi to sever his remaining natural arm and both legs in one strike. Heartbroken over his former pupil's fall to the dark side, Kenobi retrieved Vader's [[Skywalker's lightsaber|lightsaber]] and tearfully expressed his disgust and sadness over Vader's betrayal of the Jedi Order, shouting that his destiny was to restore balance to the Force and defeat the Sith, not join them and leave the Force in darkness. Vader responded by screaming that he hated his former master. This statement only further crushed Kenobi, who responded that he had loved him like a brother.

Vader's clothes then burst into flames from the lava, severely burning him. Unwilling to help his former friend or murder him in cold blood, Kenobi left him to his apparent fate and returned to Amidala's ship, where C-3PO had already brought her back on board. When she asked if Skywalker was all right, Kenobi did not respond and let her rest as they left the planet.<ref name="Episode III" />

====Birth of the Skywalker-Twins====
{{Dialogue|GH-7|"Medically, she is completely healthy. For reasons we can't explain, we are losing her."|Kenobi|She's dying?|GH-7|We don't know why. She has lost the will to live.

[[File:Midwife_droid_1.png|thumb|right|260px|Kenobi at the birth of the twins.]]
Just as the Emperor rescued Vader from the lava beach and gave him prosthetic limbs and a [[Vader's armor|life-support suit]], Kenobi, C-3PO and R2-D2 took Amidala to [[Polis Massa]]. There, he, along with Bail Organa and Yoda, were informed that the dying Amidala was carrying twins. Kenobi was in the birthing room with Amidala as she gave birth to her two children, [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]] and [[Leia Organa|Leia]]. As she took her final breath, Amidala told Kenobi she knew there was still good in Skywalker.<ref name="Episode III" />

After arriving on Naboo so that [[Funeral of Padmé Amidala|Amidala's funeral arrangements]] could be made, Yoda suggested that the children should be kept hidden and separated until the time was right: Organa would adopt Leia and take her to [[Alderaan]] as he and his wife, [[Breha Organa|Breha]], had always talked about adopting a baby girl and promised that Leia would be loved. Kenobi volunteered to take Luke to Tatooine where the boy would live with Skywalker's stepfamily, [[Owen Lars|Owen]] and [[Beru Whitesun Lars|Beru Lars]], and added that he would watch over him. As the trio prepared to go their separate ways, Yoda asked Kenobi for a moment of his time and revealed that he had training for him during his solitude on Tatooine, and that Qui-Gon Jinn had reached the path to [[immortality]], having returned from the [[Netherworld of the Force]]. Yoda told Kenobi he would teach him on how to communicate with Jinn.<ref name="Episode III" />

====Exile on Tatooine====
=====The beginning=====
{{Quote|And what of the boy?"<br />"To Tatooine. To his family, send him."<br />"I will take the child and watch over him.|Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda discuss the future of Luke Skywalker|Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith}}
[[File:DeliveringLuke-ROTS.png|thumb|left|200px|Kenobi giving Luke to Beru Lars.]]
While the twin suns set on Tatooine, Kenobi arrived at the [[Lars moisture farm]] and left Luke to his uncle and aunt, before leaving on an [[eopie]], heading to his exile in the [[Jundland Wastes]],<ref name="Episode III" /> in a [[Ben Kenobi's home|home]] surrounded by [[Western Dune Sea]].<ref name="Episode IV" /><ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" /> Within the first year of the [[Imperial Era|Age of the Empire]], Kenobi visited the grave of [[Shmi Skywalker Lars]], mother of Anakin and spoke of how he was sad for what had happened to her once innocent and promising young son. During the early years of his exile, Kenobi began to meditate deeply on the force. On one of these occasions he began to experience visions of the past causing the [[Force spirit]] of Qui-Gon Jinn to counsel him to let go of his attachments.<ref name="Ahsoka">''[[Ahsoka (novel)|Ahsoka]]''</ref>

To conceal his identity, he would once again use the alias of "Ben Kenobi", as he had done during the Clone Wars,<ref name="Deception" /> and forfeited the use of his lightsaber for years; however, he struggled to repress his sense of duty as a Jedi, he spent years battling monotony and inactivity,<ref name="SW7" /> and gained the reputation of being somewhat of an old hermit. At some point, Kenobi would be forbidden from seeing or training Luke, as Lars feared the boy would end up following his father's footsteps; nevertheless, Kenobi heard that the young Skywalker had become quite the pilot.<ref name="Episode IV" />

=====The Journals of Ben Kenobi=====
[[File:Ben Kenobi saves young Luke.png|thumb|right|200px|Kenobi saves 8-year-old Luke]]
In preparation of Luke's future training, Kenobi wrote [[The Journals of Ben Kenobi|a set of journals]] and placed them in a box labeled "For Luke."<ref name="Star Wars 6">''[[Star Wars 6: Skywalker Strikes, Part VI]]''</ref> In one of his journals, Kenobi wrote about how he stopped Jabba the Hutt's men from collecting their "[[water tax]]" on the local [[Moisture farmer|farmers]] during the [[Great Drought]],<ref name="SW7" /> eight years into his exile.<ref name="White-tweet">{{Twitter|cracksh0t|status/626888339249991680|[[Jordan D. White]]|quote=@TMBGeeks @DorkSideOForce he looks like 8ish to me.}}</ref> He kept Jabba's thugs from extorting the Lars family into paying their water tax; following his subtle use of the Force to cause the thugs' firearms to misfire so that wouldn't harm townspeople, he decided not to go into town anymore.<ref name="SW7" />

That same night, he sensed Skywalker to be in danger, for the boy had gone to take the water back from Jabba's men and give it back to the farmers. Kenobi went to their encounter, but blew their vehicle's lights with the Force to hide his identity and proceeded to disable all of Jabba's henchmen with the Force. One of them became startled and pushed Skywalker to the ground, causing him to hit his head and pass out. Once Kenobi handled all the thugs, he carried Skywalker to the Lars' homestead and left before he woke up. Luke's courage assured Kenobi that it wasn't the end of the Jedi and renewed his up-until-then waning hope.<ref name="SW7" />

[[File:Star Wars 15.jpg|thumb|left|283x283px|Obi-Wan in exile]]
A year later the Great Drought had ended, and Kenobi found himself observing a young Luke piloting a [[T-16 skyhopper]] through [[Beggar's Canyon]]. Kenobi noted how similar Luke was to his father Anakin, and expressed worry at the prospect. While attempting to impress his friends with an ostentatious maneuver through the canyon, Luke badly damaged the Skyhopper and was subsequently grounded from flying by his uncle. Kenobi, feeling sympathy for the boy, took a job protecting a [[Jawa]] [[sandcrawler]] that had been experiencing troublesome raids by [[Tusken Raider]]s. That night, Kenobi meditated outside of the sandcrawler, communing with Qui-Gon and expressing his hope in Luke's abilities. Soon the Tusken Raiders arrived and Kenobi able to easily dispatch the party with a disarmed raider's [[Gaderffii stick]]. He used whatever payment he earned from the job to hire the Jawa's to deliver the necessary parts to fix the Skyhopper. At a droid auction at an unidentified outpost, Luke received the the parts Kenobi had provided for him. Luke believed the parts had been a gift from his uncle and thanked Owen, as he eagerly rushed back home. Deriving pleasure from the boys enthusiasm, Kenobi grinned fondly as he observed from behind a nearby tent.<ref name="SW15">''[[Star Wars 15: From the Journals of Old Ben Kenobi]]''</ref>

[[File:Star Wars 20 textless cover.png|right|thumb|250px|Black Krrsantan vs Obi-Wan Kenobi]]
Later that day in his hut, Kenobi was cooking dinner when he was interrupted by a visit from Owen. Owen had put two and two together, and sternly demanded that Kenobi have no part in his family's life. He had brought back the box of tools that he presumably confiscated from Luke, and dumped it on the floor of the hut. Kenobi responded back with several snarky replies before finally relenting and saying he that he only ever wanted to help. Owen continued to berate him, calling him dangerous and troublesome. As Owen departed, Kenobi regretfully admitted to himself that danger did in fact seemed to follow him. But he steeled his resolve and claimed that no danger would come to the young Skywalker boy as long as he lived. Coincidentally, Jabba the Hutt chose this time to send a Wookiee bounty hunter [[Black Krrsantan]] after Owen, who he believed was responsible for roughing up his tax collectors during the Great Drought.<ref name="SW15" />The next day, Owen had a change of heart and himself purchased a box of parts. He searched through the Lars homestead looking for Luke, hoping to fix the Skyhopper with the boy as a way to apologize for his coarse actions the previous day. However, he was ambushed by Black Krrsantan and kidnapped. Luke, in childish defiance, was running away from home. He made it a short distance out before sensing – likely through the Force – that something had gone awry at the homestead. Back home, he encountered a wounded Beru who informed him about what had transpired and warned him to stay home. She ran out of the house armed with a rifle, leaving Luke with the discarded pile of tools Owen had earlier dropped.<ref name="SW20">''[[Star Wars 20: From the Journals of Old Ben Kenobi]]''</ref>

While meditating in the [[Dune Sea]] among a herd of [[Bantha]]s, Kenobi felt a disturbance in the Force. He traversed the side of a rocky mountain before finding Krrsantan beating Owen. In the ensuing conflict, Kenobi was trapped under a mesh of [[Stun net/Legends|stun net]] that was dispatched by the Wookiee. Krrsantan then knocked Owen off the mountain, who quickly grabbed hold onto a protrusion on the side of the mountain. Kenobi escaped the net and stunned the Wookiee, sprinting over to Owen to grab him back up. However, Krrsantan intervened and threw an enormous bolder at Kenobi. Kenobi used his lightsaber to split the rock in two, also blinding Krrsantan in one eye during the process. The debris from the rock crashed into Owen's ledge and he nearly fell if not for Kenobi's use of the Force. Kenobi held Owen in place using the Force before losing focus as a result of Krrsantan's constant attacks. Owen fell, but was deftly saved by Luke, who used the repaired Skyhopper's turret to break Owen's fall. Kenobi then used this opportunity to disarm the Wookiee, who plunged off the side of the mountain. He did not die however, and escaped off-world to escape Jabba's wrath. Owen reunited with Luke at the foot of the mountain and held the boy in deep embrace. He casted a knowing glance up toward Kenobi who looked on in triumph.<ref name="SW20" />

There were no words of thanks exchanged between Owen and Kenobi, but Kenobi was simply happy to see the family reunited. Kenobi then returned to his family, which was what he fondly called his herd of Banthas. Among them, he looked up into the sky to see Luke's Skyhopper, soaring off into the sunset.<ref name="SW20" />

Kenobi was later visiting [[Mos Eisley]] for supplies when he experienced a vision of a mysterious man. Kenobi recognized the man as [[Garro]] from a tale Jedi Master Yoda had told him. He would go on to recount this in his journal.<ref name="Star Wars 28">''[[Star Wars 28: Yoda's Secret War, Part III]]''</ref>

=====Encountering Maul=====
{{Quote|Look what has become of you. A rat in the desert."''<br />"''Look what I've risen above.|Maul and Obi-Wan Kenobi|Twin Suns (episode)|Twin Suns}}
[[File:320 Twin Suns.png|left|thumb|250px|Kenobi prepares to face Maul one last time.]]
In [[2 BBY]], Maul [[Mission to Tatooine (Imperial Era)|arrived]] on Tatooine in search of Kenobi, following his vision of the twin suns. Kenobi managed to keep Maul from tracking him until Maul used a [[Sith holocron]] to lure [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel]] Padawan [[Ezra Bridger]] from his base on the planet [[Atollon]] to Tatooine, hoping the young Jedi's pain would be enough to draw Kenobi out. Kenobi found Ezra unconscious in the Dune Sea and sheltered him from the storm. Ezra regained consciousness and, knowing of Maul's hatred towards Kenobi from his own encounters with the former Sith, tried to warn Obi-Wan of Maul's presence. Kenobi calmly replied that he knew of it already and that he hadn't gone into hiding unprepared. He told Ezra that it was Ezra's responsibility to help the Rebellion; not to handle Maul. That burden fell upon Kenobi himself.<ref name="Twin Suns">{{Rebels|Twin Suns (episode)|Twin Suns}}</ref>

Soon thereafter Maul arrived, seething with rage upon seeing his old rival after so many years. Kenobi sent Bridger off on a [[dewback]] toward [[Nightbrother (Gauntlet fighter)|Maul's ship]], which Bridger would use to fly back to Atollon. Maul mocked Kenobi's lackluster living conditions, and wondered out loud whether it would be more cruel to simply leave Kenobi to what Maul believed was a life of misery and squalor. But rather than responding with mockery in turn, as he might have in his younger years, Kenobi calmly and succinctly explained to Maul that the former Sith Lord in fact had even less, because he defined himself by his empty desires to kill, possess, and dominate. This infuriated Maul, who ignited one of the blades of his saberstaff and struck the ground in front of Kenobi's small campfire, showering it with sand and putting it out. Maul then began to speculate on his old nemesis's reasons for being on Tatooine, and quickly came to the conclusion that Kenobi was there to protect someone. Stirred to action by the threat of Maul to Luke, Kenobi ignited his lightsaber and assumed his traditional Form III stance. As Maul tightened his grip on his own saber and ignited his second blade, Kenobi shifted his stance to the one used by his old master Qui-Gon during the duel on Naboo in the [[Theed power generator]].<ref name="Twin Suns" />

[[File:Maul dies but for real this time.png|thumb|right|252x252px|Maul dies in Kenobi's arms.]]
Maul noted Kenobi's change in stance and after a few tense moments, attacked. He crossed blades with Kenobi twice before attempting to hit him with the same hilt-strike that had allowed him to kill Qui-Gon. However, Kenobi had evidently anticipated this, and he struck down at Maul's hilt as Maul struck upwards, bisecting Maul's lightsaber and carving a lethal laceration into the former Sith Lord's chest. Maul dropped his ruined weapon and collapsed to one knee, but Kenobi caught him before he could fall to the ground and held him. As Maul laid dying, he asked Kenobi whether the person whom he was protecting was the Chosen One; the one prophesied to destroy the Sith. Kenobi, at that point of the opinion believed that Vader would never turn from the dark side, replied that he was. Maul appeared to take some modicum of comfort from this knowledge, seemingly certain that he and Kenobi would ultimately be avenged. Kenobi then traveled via dewback to the Lars' Homestead. Upon arriving there, he heard Beru Whitesun Lars calling to Luke and saw the teenager running back home against a binary sunset.<ref name="Twin Suns" />

At some point, Kenobi built a funeral pyre for Maul, honoring his adversary.<ref name="Time of Death">{{Shortstory|story=Time of Death|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>

===Galactic Civil War===
====Coming out of exile====

[[File:Ben Kenobi.jpg|200px|thumb|left|"Ben" Kenobi during his last years in exile.]]
As the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] foresaw [[Galactic Civil War|open war]] with the Empire becoming more of a possibility, they decided to take every advantage. Shortly before the [[Battle of Scarif]], Kenobi's old friend Bail Organa, who, by this point, was a high-ranking leader within the Alliance, decided to recruit the exiled Jedi Master to their cause at [[Chancellor (Rebel Alliance)|Chancellor]] [[Mon Mothma]]'s urging.<ref name="Rogue One">''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''</ref> Unable to attend to it in person, Organa sent his daughter [[Prince]]ss Leia Organa to request Kenobi's help.<ref name="Episode IV" /> Organa, barely escaping from the battle that had just taken place at [[Scarif]] after having recovered the [[Death Star plans|schematics]] for the Empire's planet-destroying [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]],<ref name="Rogue One" /> was captured in a [[Secret mission to Tatooine|battle]] over Tatooine. Leia transferred the plans into R2-D2's memory systems and sent the droid off to find Kenobi. This lead R2-D2 and C-3PO on a crusade that lead them to being captured by a band of [[Jawa]]s and being sold to Owen Lars and Luke Skywalker. However, R2-D2 ran off from the Lars homestead and off into the [[Jundland Wastes]] to try and find Kenobi. C-3PO, who was unaware of the mission given to R2-D2 by Princess Leia, encouraged Skywalker to go after the wayward astromech droid, but before they could return to the homestead, they were attacked by a group of Tusken Raiders. Kenobi showed up on the scene and scared the Tusken Raiders off by imitating the hunting cry of a [[krayt dragon]].<ref name="Episode IV" />

Restoring Skywalker to consciousness, the boy told him that R2-D2 was looking for someone named "Obi-Wan Kenobi", to which Kenobi replied that was, in fact, his real name. To avoid more Tusken Raider attacks, Kenobi brought the two droids and the farm boy to his home. There, Kenobi revealed that he had known Skywalker's father, and that he'd been a Jedi Knight during the Clone Wars, and gave Skywalker his father's lightsaber. When Luke asked how his father had died, Kenobi was careful not to tell him that Anakin Skywalker and Darth Vader were one and the same; instead claiming that Vader, his former apprentice, had fallen to the dark side of the Force and helped the Empire hunt down and kill the Jedi, including Anakin. Though he wasn't technically lying to Luke - the man who Anakin Skywalker had been had died when he became Darth Vader - he wasn't being directly truthful either, and Luke would not learn the whole truth for another several years.<ref name="Episode IV" />
[[File:Leias_message.png|300px|thumb|right|Kenobi watches Leia's message.]]
After this, Luke decided to show Kenobi the partial message from Leia Organa. The message finally played in its entirety, stating her father's request for him to aid the Alliance and that R2-D2 contained information vital to the survival of the Alliance. After the message concluded, Kenobi requested Skywalker's help to see the mission through and learn the ways of the Force, but Skywalker refused to get involved as he believed his duties at home were more important, but he offered to take Kenobi as far as [[Anchorhead]].<ref name="Episode IV" />

On their way to the city, the two came across the skiff that had sold R2-D2 and C-3PO to Skywalker and his uncle; it had been desroyed and the Jawas had been killed. Initially believing it to be the casualty of another Tusken Raider attack, Kenobi correctly deduced that the attack was, in fact, the work of [[stormtrooper]]s who were searching for the droids. Worried that the stormtroopers may have gone after his aunt and uncle next, Skywalker headed back home despite Kenobi's claims that it was too dangerous. After Skywalker returned from discovering that the Imperials had attacked the homestead and killed both Owen and Beru, Kenobi arranged a small funeral pyre for all the Jawas killed by the Empire's soldiers.<ref name="Episode IV" /> It was at this time that he was met by the spectre of Jinn who offered him counsel.<ref name="Master and Apprentice">{{Shortstory|story=Master and Apprentice (short story)|sformatted=Master and Apprentice|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref> When Skywalker returned, the young man agreed to go with him to Alderaan and be trained as a Jedi.<ref name="Episode IV" />

====Leaving Tatooine====
{{Quote|If his ship is as fast as his boasting, we ought to do well.|Kenobi regarding Han Solo and the ''Millennium Falcon''.|Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope}}
The four ventured out to [[Mos Eisley]] and paid a visit to [[Chalmun's Cantina]] in hopes of recruiting a pilot that could take them to Alderaan. Skywalker was skeptical about the prospect of finding a pilot in the cantina, but Kenobi assured him that the best pilots could usually be found there, but warned him that the cantina could "be a little rough." They ran into a small bout of trouble when a pair of wanted criminals, [[Cornelius Evazan]] and [[Ponda Baba]], began bullying Skywalker, but Kenobi was able to defuse the situation when he sliced off Baba's arm in defense of the young man.

Kenobi soon met a Wookiee named [[Chewbacca]], who served as the first mate onboard a freighter known as the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', which was captained by a [[Corellia]]n [[smuggler]] named [[Han Solo]]. Solo boasted about his ship's speed to entice Kenobi. Though Solo's initial rate was 10,000 [[credits]] all paid in advance, Kenobi was able to compromise: offering to pay 2,000 credits up front, with an additional 15,000 when they got to Alderaan, for a total of 17,000 credits. Solo was convinced and agreed to take them to Alderaan. However, they were soon spotted by a Imperial [[spy]] named [[Garindan ezz Zavor]], who notified Imperial stormtroopers of their location. Fortunately, the ''Millennium Falcon'' was able to escape Tatooine.<ref name="Episode IV" />

[[File:Got_A_Bad_feeling.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Kenobi, Skywalker, Chewbacca and Han Solo in the ''Millennium Falcon'' approaching the Death Star.]]
As they waited for the ''Falcon'' to arrive in Alderaan, Kenobi arranged an exercise for Skywalker so that he would learned how to sense through the Force and [[Form V|deflect]] blaster fire from a [[Marksman-H training remote|training remote]], when the Jedi Master sensed a disturbance in the Force caused by [[the Disaster]]. Soon enough, the ''Falcon'' exited hyperspace, and they discovered that the planet had been destroyed and replaced by an [[asteroid]] [[Asteroid field|field]]. As a [[TIE/ln space superiority starfighter|TIE fighter]] approached them, Solo decided to shoot the small ship, but Skywalker noticed that the ship was coming from what, at first, seemed like a small moon - the Death Star. As the space station's [[tractor beam]] pulled them in, Kenobi told Solo not to resist, saying there were alternatives to fighting.<ref name="Episode IV" />

====Duel on the Death Star and death====
{{Quote|You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.|Obi-Wan Kenobi to Darth Vader|audio=You can't win Darth.ogg|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}
As the ''Millennium Falcon'' was forced to land on Bay 327, Solo prompted everyone to hide on the ship's sensor-proof smuggling compartments, with Kenobi hiding alongside the two droids, to trick the Imperials into thinking they had abandoned the ship. As the Imperial scouts got off the ship, Kenobi told Solo he would take care of the tractor beam, which prompted Solo to call him a "damn fool"; soon enough, with Skywalker and Solo disguised as stormtroopers, they took control of the hangar's control room, where Kenobi learned the location of a terminal that, should one cut its power, it would allow the ship to leave. He decided to go alone despite Skywalker's protest, to whom he told that his destiny laid in a different path than his own, and reassured Skywalker that the Force would be with him always.<ref name="Episode IV" />

As Skywalker, Solo and Chewbacca learned of Organa's presence on the station and set out to [[Rescue of Princess Leia|rescue]] her, Kenobi managed to disable the tractor beam; however, as he made his way to the ''Falcon'', he encountered Vader and the two engaged in one final duel. Vader claimed to be the true master of the Force, but Kenobi instead claimed that he was only a "master of evil." During the duel, Vader noted that his age had made him weak, but Kenobi told his former apprentice that he wouldn't win because he would become more powerful than Vader could ever imagine, even if he managed to kill him.<ref name="Episode IV" />

[[File:Vaderstrike.png|thumb|250px|right|Kenobi is struck down by his former apprentice.]]
The two made their way to Bay 327 just as the team reunited to board the ''Falcon'', only for Kenobi to see the young Skywalker and give Vader a mysteriously knowing smile. As he raised his blade in surrender and took a deep breath, Vader struck him down and his body disappeared, for he had become one with the Force. Unable to attend to the body of his master, Skywalker was forced to escape on the ''Falcon'' with everyone else.<ref name="Episode IV" />

===Post-mortem===
====Communication with Luke====
{{Quote|Remember... the Force will be with you. Always.|Obi-Wan Kenobi to Luke Skywalker|audio=TheForceWillBeWithYouAlways.ogg|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}
Kenobi's communion with Qui-Gon was successful as Kenobi did not vanish completely but became a Force spirit. As he did, he felt past, present, future collide, seeing the eventual [[Battle of Starkiller Base|death of Solo]] on [[Starkiller Base]], and his apprentice's self-imposed exile on [[Ahch-To]].<ref name="Time of Death" /> Using his new-found abilities, he was able to guide Skywalker during the Battle of [[Yavin]] so that he could successfully destroy the Death Star with [[proton torpedo]]es.<ref name="Episode IV" />

About five days later, the spirit of Kenobi would go to Dagobah, where he would visit Yoda regarding Skywalker. Kenobi listened as Yoda explained that Leia was by far the best candidate to pick up the mantle of Jedi, as Luke was impetuous, headstrong, unruly, and inattentive like Anakin. Nevertheless, Kenobi remained steadfast in his resolve that Luke be trained and was successful in gaining Yoda's approval to bring the boy to him.<ref name="There is Another">{{Shortstory|story=There is Another|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>

When Skywalker was about to confront Darth Vader in the [[Weapons Factory Alpha|weapons factory Alpha]] on the [[Attack on Cymoon 1|assault]] of [[Cymoon 1]], Kenobi reached out to Skywalker through the Force and told him to run.<ref name="SW1">''[[Star Wars 1: Skywalker Strikes]]''</ref>

Later, while Luke was stationed above [[Vrogas Vas]], he was attacked by Vader and crash-landed near an abandoned Jedi Temple<ref name="VD1">''[[Vader Down, Part I]]''</ref> he had read about in one of Kenobi's journals, however while searching for something to use in the temple, he was contacted by Kenobi's voice, which told him to abandon the place, as he did not believe Luke was ready. As Luke asked how he should get ready, he was attacked and captured by General [[Karbin]]'s stormtroopers. When Vader entered the temple, Kenobi called out to him, stating that Luke was the Chosen One and once again expressed his regret for Vader's fall; Vader dismissed Kenobi's presence as a delusion.<ref name="SW14">''[[Star Wars 14: Vader Down, Part V]]'' </ref>

Three years later, Kenobi would reappear to Luke on the ice planet of [[Hoth]], where he instructed Skywalker to go to the Dagobah system to seek out Kenobi's former master, Yoda, for further Jedi training. Yoda once again expressed doubts concerning Skywalker, still believing him to be too old, impatient and reckless, as much as he had anger in him like his father once had. However, Kenobi reminded Yoda that he had been once similar to Luke, back when Yoda taught him.<ref name="Episode V" />

When Skywalker received a vision of his friends in trouble on the [[Cloud City]] of [[Bespin]], Skywalker rushed to aid them. Kenobi warned him that he was at a crossroads and that his abilities were what the Emperor wanted; Kenobi didn't want to lose Skywalker to the Emperor the way he had lost Vader. He also told the Jedi apprentice that, if he was to face Darth Vader, he would do it alone as he couldn't interfere. Finally, Kenobi gave Skywalker some final advice in that he shouldn't give into hate for it led to the dark side. As Skywalker departed from Dagobah, Kenobi was worried that the Jedi may have lost their last hope, only for Yoda to remind him of Luke's sister, Leia Organa.<ref name="Episode V" />

[[File:Kenobi and Luke Chatting.png|left|thumb|250px|Kenobi recounting to Luke about Anakin Skywalker's seduction to the Dark Side.]]
About a year later, he reappeared after the death of Yoda to explain why he did not tell Luke the truth about his father. Though Luke wanted to believe that there was still good in his father, echoing Padmé's belief from twenty-three years ago, Kenobi no longer held that belief. He told Luke that he must face his destiny by confronting Vader once again. When Luke asked the meaning of Yoda's final words, "there is another Skywalker", Kenobi confessed that Leia was Luke's sister, and that they had been hidden from each other to keep them both safe. He also warned Luke about the powers of the Emperor.<ref name="Episode VI">[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]</ref>

[[File:JediGhosts-ROTJ.png|thumb|250px|right|Anakin, Yoda, and Kenobi as Force spirits on Endor.]]
Following the climatic [[Battle of Endor]], Kenobi appeared standing next to the spirits of Anakin Skywalker and Yoda as they watched Luke and the other rebels celebrate their momentous victory, although Luke was the only one able to see them.<ref name="Episode VI" />

====Communication with Rey====
{{Quote|You will be tempted. But you can learn. The Force will be with you...The Dark Side...The Jedi..You will do it alone...Rey...These are your...first...steps....|Obi-Wan Kenobi to Rey|The Force Awakens, Part IV}}
30 years later, Obi-Wan's voice was heard by [[Rey]] during a vision she received upon touching the lightsaber that previously belonged to Luke Skywalker, and his father before him. Obi-Wan called out to Rey, telling her "these are your first steps".<ref name="Episode VII">[[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']]</ref>

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Who's the more foolish, the fool, or the fool who follows him?|Obi-Wan Kenobi|audio=Who's more foolish.ogg|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}
[[File:Kenobi Jedi armor.jpg|thumb|202x202px|left|Kenobi during the Clone Wars]]
In his youth, the loyal and dedicated Obi-Wan Kenobi possessed a dry sense of humor and sarcastic wit. Yoda said that he sensed Qui-Gon Jinn's defiance in him,<ref name="Episode I" /> and Jinn himself reflected upon Kenobi's considerable knowledge and potential; he also considered his Padawan a lot wiser than him, if somewhat headstrong.<ref name="Episode I" /> Often seen wise beyond his years, his humble and soft-spoken demeanor belied his warrior prowess. Despite his numerous complaints during flight, he was also a skilled pilot. In many ways, he represented the strength of the old Jedi Order: steadfast, selfless, and modest. His later skill at resolving disputes without a single battle would earn him the sobriquet "The Negotiator", at least in the eyes of General Grievous.<ref name="Episode III" />

Over time, Kenobi lost some of his youthful audacity and assumed the role of a more cautious and conservative mentor to Anakin Skywalker, who was in many ways his opposite in personality. Kenobi carefully measured his actions in any situation, garnering him the aforementioned nom de guerre. Kenobi was also known to be an accomplished storyteller. While hiding in the Jundland Wastes in his later years, he appeared as a kindly and eccentric old hermit (or, in Owen Lars' words, "That [[Wikipedia:Wizard|wizard]] is just a crazy old man") to those not familiar with the ways of the Jedi. In his final days, Kenobi retained his traits of patience and foresight as well as gaining some of the boldness reminiscent of his youth.<ref name="Episode I" />

Kenobi often thought out plans and strategies rather than leaping into action. He would usually place his hand on his chin or stroke his beard as he thought. This was a common trait of the Jedi Master, one that his apprentice Anakin Skywalker did not practice very often.<ref name="Rookies" /> He sometimes mentally repeated the Jedi Code to calm himself.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

Kenobi's respect for the lives of others led him to emerge from hiding to save Ezra Bridger and the [[C1-series astromech droid]] [[C1-10P|Chopper]] from succumbing to the deserts of Tatooine. Kenobi then reproved Ezra for succumbing to Maul's manipulation and counselled the young rebel to return to his place with the rebellion. Despite not hating Maul, Kenobi was prepared to fight and kill him in self defense. After mortally wounding Maul, Kenobi comforted the former Sith and assured him that he was watching over the "Chosen One", Luke Skywalker, though Luke was not the Chosen One by prophecy.<ref name="Twin Suns" />

===Romantic relationship===

====Satine Kryze====
{{Quote|I've loved you from the moment you came to my aid all those years ago.''<nowiki>" [</nowiki>'''&hellip;'''<nowiki>]</nowiki><br />"''Had you said the word, I would have left the Jedi Order.|Satine and Kenobi|audio=ObiWanInLove-VoT.ogg|Voyage of Temptation}}
During [[Mandalore]]'s [[Mandalorian Civil War|Civil War]] and his apprenticeship under Qui-Gon Jinn, Kenobi fell in love with the young Duchess Satine. The Jedi Knights and queen lived on the run for over a year. Satine reciprocated his feelings as he saved her life from insurgents and bounty hunters. When Kenobi's mission ended, he chose to honor his obligations to the Jedi order in accordance to the [[Jedi Code]]. However, he regretted leaving the Duchess alone to rebuild Mandalore.<ref name="Voyage of Temptation" />

Years later during the Clone Wars,<ref name="The Mandalore Plot" /> Kenobi and Satine still had feelings for each other, but found themselves on opposing sides. Satine had begun to advocate a course of neutrality for herself and 1,500 systems that wanted no part in the war, while Kenobi defended the use of military action to end the conflict with the Separatists, including a military presence on Mandalore to protect it from the Death Watch. As such, their inability to express their feelings led them to bicker relentlessly about their conflicting philosophies. Only when forced into action did their camarederie return. When Satine was taken hostage by Senator Merrick, she confessed that she had always loved him. Kenobi, despite the situation, confessed that he too loved her and would have left the Jedi Order if she asked it of him. Despite their confessions, Kenobi and Kryze continued with their responsibilities as peace keepers.<ref name="Voyage of Temptation" />

When Maul resurfaced on Mandalore, Kenobi attempted to rescue her from him. Unfortunately, they were both captured. Kenobi was forced watch Maul choke Satine and ultimately watch Maul kill her with the [[Darksaber]]. Kenobi mourned her, but refused to give in to his anger to avenge her.<ref name="The Lawless" />

==Powers and abilities==
{{Quote|You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.|Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi|audio=You can't win Darth.ogg|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}
Though he had clear preferences for diplomacy, Kenobi was one of the greatest swordsmen and Force-users in Jedi history.{{Fact}}

===Lightsaber abilities===
[[File:KenobiEpIIISaber-MR.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Obi-wan Kenobi's third and last lightsaber.]]
Kenobi was a very capable lightsaber duelist, one of the greatest swordsmen of his time. Throughout his training years, he had learnt several forms of [[lightsaber combat]], especially [[Form III]].<ref name="Dark Disciple" /><ref name="Episode I" /> In contrast to the aggressive dueling styles of his master, Qui-Gon Jinn, and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker, Kenobi's combat style was mainly defensive, though he would use aggressive attacks when pressed. He faced some of the most dangerous people in the galaxy, such as the deadly Sith Lord Darth Maul and infamous Jedi Hunter General Grievous, respectively, the latter of whom he fought on at least seven occasions. Though he lost to the cyborg in three of their encounters (the first, fifth and sixth), he was able to survive every time without any serious injury.

[[File:KenobiVsVentress-TCWf.png|right|thumb|220px|Obi-Wan and Ventress engage in lightsaber combat]]
He was able to duel Grievous to a draw in their third and fourth encounters, and was able to overpower him in their second duel and ultimately killed him in the final round. However, it should be noted that Kenobi ultimately killed Grievous with a blaster rather than his lightsaber. Although Kenobi usually used only one lightsaber, he also seemed to have been well-versed in the art of [[Jar'Kai]], which was perhaps most prominently displayed during his duel with Darth Maul and Savage Opress, in which he wielded both his own lightsaber and the lightsaber of the deceased Adi Gallia. His mastery of dual-blade combat allowed him to hold his own against both the Sith brothers and he even managed to break Opress's left knee and sever his left arm. The duel ultimately ended as a stalemate when an angered Maul used his Force powers to briefly incapacitate Kenobi, giving the brothers time to escape.<ref name="Revival" />

Kenobi also situationally, and somewhat less successfully, used Jar'Kai against General Grievous and Cad Bane respectively.<ref name="Hunt for Ziro" /> He was also capable of using his lightsaber to ground Force lightning, as he demonstrated against Dooku on Geonosis. Kenobi was also able to defeat his former apprentice Anakin Skywalker, then Darth Vader, in an epic duel on Mustafar. Making use of his staunch Form III defense throughout the fight, Kenobi was eventually able to exploit Vader's aggressive nature, and dismembered the hate-filled Sith Lord when he recklessly jumped towards him.<ref name="Episode III" /> Decades later, he defeated his old nemesis Maul within seconds despite the former Sith Lord having demonstrated the ability to hold an advantage against three Inquisitors simultaneously,<ref name="Twin Suns" /> and duel his master Darth Sidious for a short time.<ref name="The Lawless" />

A short time later, during his rematch with Vader on the first Death Star, Kenobi proved formidable enough to hold his own against the Dark Lord for a short time. However, Vader's cautious but relentless assault ultimately overwhelmed Kenobi's defenses, and he was forced to begin retreating. Ultimately, he chose to become one with the Force rather than continue the fight and in doing this, he taught both of his Skywalker students one final lesson.<ref name="Episode IV" />

===Force powers===
{{Quote|The Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together.|Obi-Wan Kenobi, instructing Luke Skywalker|Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope}}
Though Kenobi focused largely on lightsaber combat, he was also very skilled and powerful in use of [[the Force]]. He was trained in the use of the mind trick, making use of it whenever he wanted to avoid physical confrontations.<ref name="Episode II" /><ref name="The Gungan General" /><ref name="Episode IV" /><ref name="SW7" /> He was also able to use the Force to tame, control, and lead a group of angry gutkurrs on Ryloth.<ref name="Innocents of Ryloth" /> As befitted a Jedi, Kenobi was adept at concealing his feelings in the Force when he chose to.<ref name="Dark Disciple" />

He was also capable of using telekinesis to [[Force push|push]] or levitate objects,<ref name="SW7" /> or to crush them, as seen when he destroyed two commando droids to recover his lightsaber after a difficult hand-to-hand fight with Darts D'Nar.<ref name="Kidnapped" /> He would also use the Force to augment his natural leaping ability. His ability to use the Force push technique was exceptional, as he was able to use it to blast back General Grievous dozens of meters with a single push during their duel. A short time later, he was even able to hold off a Force blast from Anakin Skywalker during their duel, though after a short time the resulting telekinetic struggle launched both of them across a room.<ref name="Episode III" />

Prior to his exile on Tatooine, Yoda instructed him on how to communicate his late master, Qui-Gon Jinn, who was unable to visibly manifest as a spirit due to his incomplete training under the [[Force Priestesses]].<ref name="Episode III" /> Through Jinn, Kenobi eventually learned the ability to manifest his consciousness after death, a skill he would later put to good use to guide and counsel his apprentice, Luke Skywalker, during the Galactic Civil War.<ref name="Episode IV" /><ref name="SW1" /><ref name="Episode V" /><ref name="Episode VI" />

===Other abilities===
Obi-Wan Kenobi proved himself to be a great military strategist and a highly studious man, demonstrating good knowledge on galactic history or conventions of war, like the [[Yavin Code]].<ref name="The Big Bang" /> He personally led his troops to many famous victories during the Clone Wars, and his persuasive demeanor earned him the moniker of "The Negotiator."<ref name="Episode III" />

Despite his dislike of flying, Kenobi was an excellent pilot. During the Clone Wars, he led many attacks from the cockpit of his Jedi starfighter or his [[Eta-2 Actis-class light interceptor|Jedi interceptor]], proving to be an outstanding pilot when navigating through an asteroid field in pursuit of Jango Fett's ship and evading his seismic charges unscathed.<ref name="Episode II" />

Kenobi was also a skilled hand-to-hand combatant, having developed enough level of skill in unarmed combat so as to compete with Pre Vizsla, leader of the Death Watch, in unarmed techniques, though he outclassed the Mandalorian in lightsaber technique.<ref name="The Mandalore Plot" /> During his duel with Jango Fett on Kamino, Kenobi was briefly deprived of his lightsaber, and fought the bounty hunter in unarmed combat.<ref name="Episode II" /> Furthermore, while he preferred lightsabers, Kenobi was an excellent marksman, as demonstrated during his time as "Rako Hardeen" in Moralo Eval's Box.<ref name="The Box" />

Though he admitted his skills were "rusty," Kenobi could read hand signals accurately enough to understand Eeth Koth's message to his location at the [[Saleucami system]].<ref name="Grievous Intrigue" />

He understood many languages, including [[Galactic Basic]], Twi'leki,<ref name="Innocents of Ryloth" /> [[Amani language]],<ref name="A Death on Utapau" /> Felucia's tribal language,<ref name="The Lost One" /> and [[Shyriiwook]].<ref name="Episode IV" />

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Obi-Wan Kenobi Episode 1 Concept Art.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Early concept for young Obi-Wan Kenobi in ''The Phantom Menace'']]
For ''[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|A New Hope]]'', Obi-Wan Kenobi was played by Sir [[Alec Guinness]], who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor (the only acting-related Academy Award nomination for any ''Star Wars'' film).<ref>http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1294729755329</ref> Guinness reprised the role as Kenobi's ghost in ''[[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|The Empire Strikes Back]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]''. Alec was not very fond of the ''Star Wars'' universe, however, and thought that the series was "fairy-tale rubbish". He disliked very much to be associated with the role of Kenobi.<ref>http://www.cancertodaymag.org/Spring2012/Pages/alec-guinness-liver-cancer.aspx</ref>

Obi-Wan Kenobi was played by [[Ewan McGregor]] in ''[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|The Phantom Menace]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'', and ''[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]''. [[James Arnold Taylor]] voiced Kenobi in the ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|The Clone Wars]]'' film and [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|TV series]], as well as ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''. In ''[[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'', Taylor returned to voice Kenobi in a brief scene during a [[Force vision]], but the voiceover was later replaced instead with one from Ewan McGregor.<ref name="TweetVoiceEwan">{{Twitter|jatactor|status/678299784621350912|[[James Arnold Taylor]]|quote=yes, it was me originally but they '''replaced my version with Ewan'''.}} {{C|in response to ''"it was you for the split second saying Rey correct?"''<nowiki>[in </nowiki>''[[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]''<nowiki>]</nowiki>}}</ref> Guinness's voice was also used, with his line "Rey" extracted from audio of him saying "afraid."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/12/20/jj-abrams-reveals-obi-wan-and-yoda-are-star-wars-force-awakens|title=Obi-Wan and Yoda are secretly in ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens''|work=Entertainment Weekly|first=Anthony|last=Breznican|date=2015-12-20|accessdate=2015-12-21}}</ref> In the ''Star Wars Rebels'' [[Star Wars Rebels Season Three|third season]] episode "[[Twin Suns (episode)|Twin Suns]]", Kenobi was voiced by [[Stephen Stanton]].<ref name="Twin Suns" />

However, ''[[The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film]]'' stated that [[George Lucas]] originally came up with the idea of having Ben die, to which Guinness initially objected. By explaining that Ben would have little to do in the story after the ''Millennium Falcon'' escaped the Death Star, Lucas convinced him to allow it., However, other sources indicate that the idea to kill off Kenobi came from [[Marcia Lucas]], after her husband complained he was unable to find a way to generate tension in the story.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/media/the-secret-weapon-behind-star-wars/news-story/75eb078a8b14d93fce23b06e98805ffb|title=The ‘secret weapon’ behind Star Wars|work=News.com.au|first=Frank|last=Chung|date=2015-12-17|accessdate=2015-12-24}}</ref>

Obi-Wan Kenobi's [[Force spirit]] was originally present in the early drafts of the [[2017]] film [[Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VIII ''The Last Jedi'']], but director [[Rian Johnson]] ultimately decided to use [[Yoda]]'s Force spirit instead, adding that the only version of Obi-Wan who interacted with Skywalker was the one of late Alec Guinness, and having Luke interacting with Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan would have felt too weird, as Luke never met Obi-Wan during his younger years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-last-jedi-force-ghost-yoda-kenobi/|title=Star Wars: They Chose the Wrong Jedi For the [SPOILER] Scene|work=CBR.com|first=Renaldo|last=Matadeen|date=2017-12-17|accessdate=2018-02-07}}</ref>

In the non-canon series ''[[LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures]]'' [[LEGO Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures Season One|Season One]] episode, "[[Crossing Paths]]", Kenobi is voiced by [[Michael Donovan]].<ref name="CP">{{The Freemaker Adventures|Crossing Paths}} credits</ref> Kenobi would later make an appearance in a hologram in "[[Duel of Destiny]]".<ref name="DOD">{{The Freemaker Adventures|Duel of Destiny}}</ref>

===Ben Kenobi's observation of Luke===
The Korean [[Star Wars (LINE Webtoon)|''Star Wars'' LINE Webtoon]] features a short story about Luke Skywalker's childhood. According to the comic, despite Lars' effort to prevent Luke from meeting Kenobi, Luke eventually met him when he became 12 years old. Skywalker went on an adventure with his friend [[Windy]], riding a dewback, but they soon encountered a [[sandstorm]] and both lost consciousness. When Skywalker awoke, there was a [[krayt dragon]] nearby sneaking up on him. Just as the dragon attempted to attack, Kenobi appeared and beheaded the giant creature. When Skywalker asked who he was, Kenobi answered that his name was "Ben Kenobi" and revealed that he was an old friend of Skywalker's father.<ref name="Line Webtoon">''[[Star Wars (LINE Webtoon)]]''</ref>

Kenobi took Skywalker and Windy back to their village, meeting Skywalker's uncle, Owen Lars. Lars thanked him for bringing Luke back safely but told him to stay back from the kid, because he didn't want to put Skywalker in danger. In return, Kenobi said he was observing Skywalker and claimed that the Force was strong in him, telling Lars that he would leave the farm one day. Lars responded that the Jedi were done since the Republic had fallen, warning him once again to never visit their homestead again.<ref name="Line Webtoon" />
