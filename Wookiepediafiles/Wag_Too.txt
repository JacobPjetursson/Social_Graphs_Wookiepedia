{{Quote|This is Wag Too. He's a healer. He can make you well again.|Ahsoka Tano, to Anakin Skywalker|Jedi Crash}}
'''Wag Too''' was a [[Lurmen]] healer and the son of [[Tee Watt Kaa]], the elder of [[Maridun]]'s [[Lurmen village]], who lived during the [[Clone Wars]].

==Biography==
During the [[Clone Wars]], Wag Too and other [[Lurmen]] lived in their [[Lurmen village|village]] on [[Maridun]]. However, they were then visited by [[Jedi]] [[Jedi Knight|Knight]] [[Aayla Secura]], [[Padawan]] [[Ahsoka Tano]], and [[Clone Commander|Commander]] [[CC-5052|Bly]] after they crash-landed. At first, his [[Parent|father]], [[Tee Watt Kaa]], refused to aid the Jedi until Tano told them that her master, [[Anakin Skywalker]], was close to [[Death|dying]]. Wag Too then went with Tano and Bly while Secura stayed with his father. When they arrived at the crash site, Wag Too assisted Tano, Bly and Captain [[Rex]] in subduing a [[Mastiff phalone]]. Wag Too then treated Skywalker. After a stretcher was built, Wag Too and the other then returned to the village, where he uses oil from seed pod to heal his wounds.<ref name="Jedi Crash" />

Wag Too then helped the Jedi and the [[Cloning|clones]] hide when a [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist]] [[C-9979 landing craft|landing ship]] landed at the village. Wag Too and the Jedi then watched as [[battle droid]]s under [[General]] [[Lok Durd]] searched the village for weapons or [[Galactic Republic|Republic]] contraband. After the Jedi and Durd left, Wag Too spoke with his father. He did not like his father allowing them to be harassed by the Separatists, despite the temporary peace.<ref name="DoP">{{TCW|Defenders of Peace}}</ref>

Wag Too then sent one of his friends to follow the Jedi. When news came that the Separatists were returning, Wag Too suggested they should defend themselves. However, he respected his father's wishes. During the [[Defense of Maridun|attack]], Wag Too and the other villagers stood by until the battle droids were overwhelming the Jedi and [[Clone trooper|clones]]. They then, despite Tee Watt Kaa's objection, assisted Tano in defeating the [[droid]]s by knocking them down. After Durd was captured, Wag Too thanked the Jedi before they left.<ref name="DoP" />
