'''Romba''' was a [[Sexes|male]] [[Ewok]] from [[Endor]]. A [[Hunting|hunter]], he once [[Death|slew]] a [[boar-wolf]], and then fashioned a [[knife]] from one of its [[Tooth|teeth]]. One night, upon returning from hunting, Romba found that his village had been burned by the [[Galactic Empire]], whose [[troop]]s had come to Endor to build a [[Deflector shield generator|shield generator]] and a troop base. Since his whole [[Unidentified Ewok tribe (Romba)|tribe]] was [[Death|dead]], Romba became a [[refugee]], and he ended up finding shelter in the [[Bright Tree Village]], led by [[Chief]] [[Chirpa]]. After a few heroes of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]] befriended Chirpa's [[Bright Tree tribe|tribe]], Romba was one of the many Ewoks that took part in the ground operations of the [[Battle of Endor]], during which the Alliance defeated the Galactic Empire. Through their triumph, Romba won justice for his lost village.<ref name="beware" />
