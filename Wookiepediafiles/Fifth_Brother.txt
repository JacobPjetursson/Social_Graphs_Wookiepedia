'''Fifth Brother''' was a [[Color|gray]]-skinned [[humanoid]] [[Sexes|male]] [[Inquisitorius|Inquisitor]] of the [[Galactic Empire]] several [[Standard year|years]] before the [[Battle of Yavin]]. On the orders of the [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]], [[Darth Sidious]], the Fifth Brother was dispatched by the [[Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] to hunt the growing rebellion against the Empire. He later [[Death|perished]] by the hands of former Sith Lord [[Maul|Darth Maul]] on Malachor.

==Biography==
===Fallen Jedi===
The individual who became known as the Fifth Brother originally occupied a position within the [[Jedi Order]]. At some point after the [[Galactic Republic]] was reorganized into the [[Galactic Empire]], he was inducted into an Imperial agency of [[The Force|Force-sensitive]] assassins called the [[Inquisitorius]], which was tasked with hunting down and eliminating any [[Jedi]] who survived [[Order 66]]. To accomplish this, he and his [[Brother/Sister|colleagues]] were trained by [[The Grand Inquisitor]] in the [[Inquisitorius Headquarters]] in [[The Works]], but soon fell under the command of [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] when [[Darth Sidious]] first demonstrated the Inquisitorius to Vader, who continued their training in the ways of the [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]] of [[the Force]].<ref name="Dark Lord 6" /> During his training with Vader, he [[Dismemberment|lost]] his right hand.<ref name="Dark Lord 7" />

===Age of the Empire===
====Working with Darth Vader====
{{Quote|Any thoughts on how we approach this? This city's not exactly small. Lots of places to hide.''"<br />"''Split up. We'll cover more ground. Stay in contact. Whoever finds them, bring in the others.|The Twi'lek Inquisitor and the Fifth Brother, on finding Eeth Koth's child.|Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 19: Fortress Vader, Part I}}
[[File:Dark Lord 20 Vader vs Inquisitors.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Darth Vader confronts the female Inquisitor in front of the Fifth Brother and the other Inquisitors]]
Following the [[Hunt on Chandar's Folly]],<ref name="Dark Lord 18">''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 18: Bad Ground]]''</ref> Darth Vader took a team of [[Inquisitorius|Inquisitors]], including Fifth Brother, on a [[Hunt for Eeth Koth|mission]] to locate Eeth Koth. When Vader and the Inquisitors arrived, they found Koth with his wife, who had just given birth. He was assigned, along with the other Inquisitors, to find the child. As they made it into the city, the [[Unidentified Twi'lek Inquisitor|Twi'lek Inquisitor]] asked how they would find the infant and the Fifth Brother suggested that they split. The three did so and the [[Unidentified female Inquisitor|female Inquisitor]] found the child first. The Fifth Brother arrived soon after and was surprised to see that she had allowed Koth's wife to escape with the baby. However, after the Twi'lek Inquisitor too arrived, the female Inquisitor used the force to pull the baby from her mother and over to her. They took it back to Vader and Koth saw the infant in their hands before he was struck down. The baby was made a part of [[Project Harvester]] and taken back to Coruscant with the Fifth Brother and the others.<ref name="Dark Lord 19">[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 19: Fortress Vader, Part I]]</ref>

After the mission, the Fifth Brother reported the female Inquisitors actions to Vader, who was already suspicious of her attachment to the Twi'lek Inquisitor. Vader deduced her to be a traitor<ref name="Dark Lord 20">''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 20: Fortress Vader, Part II]]''</ref> and when the Inquisitors were hanging around in a bar, Vader approached the female Inquisitor and ignited his lightsaber, interrupting her conversation with the Twi'lek Inquisitor.<ref name="Dark Lord 19" /> The Fifth Brother stood across the room behind the Grand Inquisitor, who asked Vader if this was a test or training exercise. Vader bluntly replied no and tried to kill the female Inquisitor, only to have his lightsaber blocked by the Twi'lek Inquisitor's. Vader confirmed his suspicions of them having a special attachment and threw the Twi'lek Inquisitor into the wall while the female Inquisitor got away. The Twi'lek Inquisitor then followed her and the Grand Inquisitor asked Vader if he needed the Inquisitors around to help. Vader told him he didn't and made chase for the two rogue Inquisitors.<ref name="Dark Lord 20" />

====A new target====
{{Quote|Lord Vader has sent me in his place.|The Fifth Brother|Relics of the Old Republic}}
[[File:TheInquisitorArrives.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Fifth Brother arrives on Konstantine's Star Destroyer.]]
After the [[Action at Mustafar|death]] of [[the Grand Inquisitor]] and after the [[Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] hunted and [[Attack on Phoenix Squadron (4 BBY)|broke]] a growing [[Phoenix Cell|rebel fleet]] during the [[Siege of Lothal]], Vader was ordered by [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]], to dispatch another Inquisitor to deal with the [[Early rebellion against the Galactic Empire|growing rebellion against the Empire]]. Vader soon sent the Fifth Brother to continue the work that he and the [[Grand Inquisitor]] had started.<ref name="Relics" />

During the Imperial [[Assault on Seelos|assault]] against the [[Spectres|Lothal rebel cell]] on the [[planet]] [[Seelos]], [[Admiral]] [[Kassius Konstantine]] was ordered to have his [[Imperial I-class Star Destroyer|Star Destroyer]] rendezvous with a [[Sentinel-class landing craft|shuttle]] he was led to believe carried [[Sith Lord|Lord]] Vader himself. In reality, however, it carried the Fifth Brother, who arrived aboard Konstantine's [[Star Destroyer]] to begin hunting the rebellion. Konstantine questioned why his [[Starship|vessel]] had to divert from Seelos to rendezvous with an Inquisitor, as the diversion may have compromised the assault that [[Imperial Security Bureau|ISB]] [[Agent]] [[Alexsandr Kallus|Kallus]] was leading on Seelos, but the Fifth Brother had no interest in the assault and pledged to stop the rebellion himself.<ref name="Relics" />

====Skirmish at the medical station====
{{Quote|I'm surprised to see you here.''"<br />"''The kill is mine!''"<br />"''You are short sighted. We will use the boy as bait to draw in the others. Now find the girl!|The Fifth Brother clashes with the [[Seventh Sister]]|Always Two There Are}}
[[File:7th-Sis-and-5th-Bro-clash.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Fifth Brother and Seventh Sister clash aboard a Republic medical station while searching for the Spectres.]]
Later, he was present with both Kallus and Konstantine on the [[Bridge (starship)|bridge]] of the [[Relentless|Star Destroyer]] when a power surge at an abandoned [[Haven-class medical station|''Haven''-class medical station]] was detected. Though Kallus dismissed it, the Fifth Brother quickly took command and immediately [[Skirmish aboard a Republic medical station|set out]] for the [[Space station|medical station]], unaware that the [[Seventh Sister]] was already there and hunting the rebels. When [[Ezra Bridger]] and [[Sabine Wren]] were fleeing the Seventh Sister, they were met by a grinning Fifth Brother who ignited his [[Fifth Brother's lightsaber|lightsaber]] threateningly. Ezra was captured helping Sabine to escape, with the Fifth Brother reaching him just as the latter fled. He attempted to kill the young Jedi with his [[lightsaber]], only for the Sister to deflect it with her [[Seventh Sister's lightsaber|own blade]]. When the Fifth Brother protested, citing Bridger as his kill, the Sister derided him for short-sightedness and pointed out that the boy could be used to trap his friends.<ref name="Always Two There Are">{{Rebels|Always Two There Are}}</ref>

[[File:Fifth threatens Sabine.png|thumb|right|250px|The Fifth Brother threatens Sabine Wren.]]
While the Seventh Sister interrogated Ezra, the Fifth Brother went to hunt down Sabine accompanied by two of the Sister's [[ID9 seeker droid]]s. Hunting her through the corridors, he sensed the presence of Sabine and the [[Lasat]] [[Garazeb Orrelios]] who had prepared an ambush consisting of several [[thermal detonator]]s planted in the corridor. Unfortunately, the Fifth Brother used the Force to [[Telekinesis|lift]] the [[detonator]]s and throw them at the rebels, knocking out Sabine in the process. Hefting the unconscious [[Mandalorian]] over his shoulder, the Brother told the two [[Seeker (droid)|seeker droids]] to do as they wished with Orrelios; both [[droid]]s were subsequently destroyed when the Lasat crushed them against boxes of medical supplies.<ref name="Always Two There Are" />

The Brother returned to find that Ezra had delivered very little information, but at that moment they received a transmission from "[[Commander]] [[Meiloorun fruit|Meiloorun]]" asking if they needed help; the Brother forced the two to accept at lightsaber point and then proceeded to Bay Six where the rebels were to arrive. When they got there, they were ambushed by Orrelios in the ''[[Phantom]]''; in the chaos, Ezra managed to recover [[Ezra's lightsaber|his lightsaber]] and both boarded the [[shuttle]]. Both Inquisitors attempted to hold it in place with the Force, but the Brother was forced to break off to deflect [[blaster]] [[fire]] and the Sister was nearly dragged out into [[Realspace|space]] when the shuttle burst free, leaving both Inquisitors fuming.<ref name="Always Two There Are" />

====Abducting children====
{{Quote|You would question me, ''Seventh'' Sister?''"<br />"''Only when you're wrong, ''Fifth'' Brother.|The Fifth Brother pulls rank on the Seventh Sister|The Future of the Force}}
Later, the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister boarded a passenger ship above the planet [[Chandel]] to seize a Force-sensitive [[Youngling|infant]] named [[Alora (child)|Alora]]. Despite the best efforts of Alora's grandmother [[Darja]] to stop them, the two Inquisitors managed to corner them and took Alora into custody. Prior to leaving the ship, the Brother killed all of the other passengers by throwing his [[double-bladed lightsaber]] at them. The Inquisitors' actions attracted the attention of the former Jedi [[Padawan]] [[Ahsoka Tano]] and the rebel crew of the ''[[Ghost]]''. While Ahsoka traveled to Chandel, Ezra, his master [[Kanan Jarrus]], Zeb, and [[C1-10P|Chopper]] traveled to the planet [[Takobo]] aboard the ''Phantom'' to investigate.<ref name="Future of the Force">{{Rebels|The Future of the Force}}</ref>

Taking Alora with them, the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister traveled to Takobo to collect a Force-sensitive [[Ithorian]] infant named [[Pypey]]. After parking their [[TIE Advanced v1|TIE Advanced starfighters]] at a [[spaceport]] [[hangar]] bay in [[Hammertown]], the two Inquisitors left a seeker droid to guard their ship and the baby. Together, they then visited Pypey's home and confronted her [[Parent|mother]] [[Oora]]. However, Oora had already sent her child away with a [[WED Treadwell repair droid|droid]]. Before leaving the house, the two Inquisitors accosted her and smashed the furniture in her home.<ref name="Future of the Force" />

While prowling the streets of Takobo, the two Inquisitors managed to intercept the droid. However, Pypey had already been picked up by Zeb. The Fifth Brother and Seventh Sister then pursued Zeb to a nearby apartment building. While the Brother used Pypey's fear to track the Jedi, the Sister sent one of her seeker droids to keep an [[eye]] outside. Shortly later, Ezra and Kanan entered the building to aid Zeb.<ref name="Future of the Force" />

Ezra's presence caused Pypey to cry since he could sense the boy's fear. Closing in on the rebels, the Fifth Brother and Seventh Sister attempted to spike them out with their lightsabers. Bridger managed to temporarily mislead the Inquisitors by using a [[comlink]] to make a recording of Pypey's cries. The Fifth Brother fell for that ruse and was warned by the Seventh Sister to stop wasting their [[time]]. In the meantime, the rebels managed to escape the room and made a run for the stairs. To confuse the Inquisitors, the rebels split up; with Bridger and Pypey heading into the ventilation shafts while Kanan and Zeb held off the Inquisitors.<ref name="Future of the Force" />

[[File:Inquisitors rebels s2.jpg|thumb|left|268x268px|Fifth Brother and Seventh Sister encounter Kanan and Zeb]]
Resuming their pursuit, the Fifth Brother sensed Ezra and Pypey's presence in the ventilation shaft above. He then used his lightsaber to spike holes in the ceilings in an attempt to flush out their quarry. Before the two Inquisitors could corner their prey, they were confronted by Kanan and Zeb. Zeb took on the Brother but was unable to match the Inquisitor's [[Force power]]s. Forced to retreat, Kanan and Zeb jumped out of the window and fled on a [[speeder]]. In response, the Inquisitors commandeered another speeder and continued the pursuit. Following another skirmish, the Inquisitors cornered their rebel foes outside the [[spaceport]].<ref name="Future of the Force" />

The two Inquisitors quickly overpowered the three rebels. Before they could finish off their work, the spaceport doors opened to reveal Tano. While the other rebels retreated aboard the ''Phantom'' with Pypey, Ahsoka [[Duel in Hammertown|engaged]] the two Inquisitors in a [[lightsaber duel]]. Armed with [[Ahsoka Tano's white lightsabers|two lightsabers]], she engaged both Inquisitors for a few moments before effortlessly side-swiping the Fifth Brother's clumsy attack and throwing him against a pillar, knocking him out. The Seventh Sister put up a better fight, but was soon defeated as well. Before Ahsoka could finish the Sister, [[Imperial Military|Imperial reinforcements]] arrived in the form of [[stormtrooper]]s and a few [[Imperial Troop Transport]]s. Though the Brother threw his lightsaber at her to try and prevent her escape, Ahsoka managed to dodge it and escaped with her rebel comrades and the babies aboard the ''Phantom''. To add insult to injury, the Fifth Brother and Seventh Sister discovered that the rebels had also destroyed their [[TIE line|TIE Advanced fighters]] and taken Pypey. However, the Inquisitors were delighted to learn from one of the Sister's seeker droids that the rebels were hiding on the planet [[Garel]].<ref name="Future of the Force" />

====Raid on Garel====
{{Quote|Garel is a major port and under our control. Surely our garrison there would've spotted Rebel activity.''"<br />"''You doubt my word, Admiral?''"<br />"''No Inquisitor, I merely look to the day when you produce results.|Admiral Konstantine and the Fifth Brother|Legacy (episode)}}
[[File:Legacy Inquisitors.png|thumb|right|250px|The Fifth Brother and Seventh Sister come face-to-face with Ezra Bridger.]]
Following their skirmish with the rebels on Takabo, the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister joined forces with Kallus and Konstantine to [[Battle on Garel|attack]] the rebel presence on Garel. The two Inquisitors accepted Kallus' suggestion that the Imperial servants work together to capture Phoenix [[Squadron]], which included the crew of the ''Ghost''. The Fifth Brother and Seventh Brother took part in the ground assault and encountered Bridger and Jarrus in their hangar bay. Despite the Sister's best efforts to goad Ezra into attacking them, Kanan prevented the fight from occurring by shutting the blast door; leaving the Inquisitors on the other side. The crew of the ''Ghost'' then took advantage of this delay to escape into the [[atmosphere]] above Garel.<ref name="Legacy">{{Rebels|Legacy (episode)|Legacy}}</ref>

====Pursuing the Jedi====
[[File:Kanan and Ezra fight the Inquisitors.png|thumb|left|250px|The Fifth Brother and Seventh Sister fighting Ezra and Kanan.]]
For several [[Standard month|months]], the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister pursued Kanan and Ezra. The two Inquisitors cornered the two Jedi while they were [[scout]]ing [[Oosalon]] as a potential site for a new rebel base. During the [[Duel on Oosalon|duel]], the Fifth Brother threw Ezra down a cliff but the young Jedi managed to cling onto his master. The two Jedi counter-attacked with [[Kanan's lightsaber|their]] lightsabers but were pushed back to the edge of the cliff by the two Inquisitors. Before the Inquisitors could finish off their Jedi opponents, the two Jedi managed to escape on the back of a [[tibidee]] before being picked up by Chopper in the ''Phantom''.<ref name="Shroud of Darkness">{{Rebels|Shroud of Darkness}}</ref>

Later, the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister visited the [[Lothal Jedi Temple|Jedi Temple]] on the planet [[Lothal]]. They landed their TIE Advanced v1 [[starfighter]]s moments after Chopper had departed the scene on the ''Phantom''. While the Brother did not sense the presence of the Jedi and thought they had left, the Sister could still sense that they were hiding in the [[Jedi temple|Temple]]. Using their Dark Side powers, the two Inquisitors forced their way into the Temple. After forcing the Temple open, the two Inquisitors entered the structure only to be confronted by several spectral [[Jedi Temple Guard]]s, who were part of a [[Force vision]]. The two Inquisitors recognized the leader as having the face of the late Grand Inquisitor, who had once been a [[Jedi Knight]].<ref name="Shroud of Darkness" />

While the Fifth Brother and the Seventh Sister both survived their supernatural encounter, they failed to captured the Jedi. However, they managed to capture the Temple and promptly informed their master [[Darth]] Vader, who came to visit the site in person. Imperial reinforcements including stormtroopers and [[LAAT/le gunship|patrol transports]] also surrounded the Temple. When the Fifth Brother reported that the Jedi were growing in their power, Vader assured him that it would be their "undoing".<ref name="Shroud of Darkness" />

====Malachor====
[[File:The light and the dark.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|The Fifth Brother, Seventh Sister and Eighth Brother fight Kanan Jarrus, Maul and Ahsoka Tano, on Malachor.]]
The Fifth Brother was ordered by Darth Vader to [[Mission to Malachor|travel]] to [[Malachor]] with the Seventh Sister and obtain [[Sith holocron (Malachor)|a]] [[Sith holocron]] from within a [[Malachor Sith Temple|Sith temple]] located beneath the planet's surface. She and her accomplice came to the aid of the [[Eighth Brother]] after he was captured by Jarrus and Tano; all three Inquisitors were forced to retreat when their opponents were joined by Bridger and his new companion, the former [[Sith]] [[Lord]] [[Maul]]. Having escaped her adversaries, the Seventh Sister dispatched some of her ID-9 seeker droids to [[spy]] on them.<ref name="Twilight" />

While the Sister pursued Maul and Ezra, the Fifth Brother went after Ahsoka and Kanan, ambushing them on one of the [[Sith temple|Temple]] parapets. Managing to catch them off-guard, he was soon joined by the Eighth Brother and together they engaged the Jedi. The situation soon turned against them when Maul, having slain the Seventh Sister, leapt into the fray and engaged the two Inquisitors on behalf of the Jedi. Taking advantage of the Fifth Brother's distraction in fending off Maul, Ahsoka lunged forwards and struck the hilt of his lightsaber, damaging the weapon and causing him to drop it. Defenseless, the Fifth Brother was swiftly cleaved through the stomach by Maul's lightsaber, ending his life.<ref name="Twilight" />

==Personality and traits==
The Fifth Brother was a tall, muscular [[humanoid]] male with [[Color|mint]] eyes and gray skin. He wore the gray and black uniform of an Inquisitor, wore a metallic headpiece, and carried a [[double-bladed spinning lightsaber]].<ref name="Relics" /> When Ezra Bridger was captured, he attempted to execute him on the spot, only to be stopped by the Seventh Sister who derided him for his short-sightedness as the boy could be used as bait.<ref name="Always Two There Are" />

==Powers and abilities==
[[File:FifthBrothersLightsaber.png|thumb|left|120px|The Fifth Brother's lightsaber.]]
The Fifth Brother held some skill in telekinesis and was able to control multiple thermal detonators, keeping them from exploding when thrown at him and then sending them back at an opponent to explode. He possessed a keen sense, which enabled him to sense the emotions of his quarry and deduce they were trying to ambush him.<ref name="Always Two There Are" />

The Fifth Brother showed some skill in [[lightsaber combat]], throwing his lightsaber with deadly precision and engaging in a few saber locks with Ahsoka Tano. However, he seemed to prefer to rely on brute force and heavy slashes, lacking any finesse or agility in contrast to most of his fellow Inquisitors. Though he was able to engage Ahsoka briefly, he was proven to be no match for her and was swiftly knocked out of the fight.<ref name="Future of the Force" /> Even though he survived his first duel with Maul, the Fifth Brother could easily have been the first casualty. He was hit in the head by the cane in Maul's left hand; had it been a lightsaber, he would've been dead.<ref name="Twilight" />

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Fifth Brother The Force Awakens Concept.png|thumb|right|200px|Unused concept art from ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' that inspired the design for the Fifth Brother]]
The Fifth Brother was created for the [[Star Wars Rebels Season Two|second season]] of the animated television series ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''.
