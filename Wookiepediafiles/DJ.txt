{{Quote|It's all a machine, partner. Live free, don't join.|DJ, explaining his life philosophy to Finn|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}
"'''DJ'''," shortened form of "'''Don't Join'''," was the alias of a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] [[slicer]] who resided in [[the galaxy]] during the [[First Order–Resistance war|war]] between the [[Resistance]] and the [[First Order]]. An amoral thief, he spoke with a stutter but was also skilled at slicing into [[computer]] systems. His philosophy was influenced by his cynical views; he therefore believed that both sides in the conflict represented two halves of a system breeding corruption and greed.

At the [[time]] of the Resistance's [[Evacuation of D'Qar|evacuation]] from the [[Resistance base|base]] on [[D'Qar]], DJ was residing on the [[planet]] [[Cantonica]] where he used his skills to steal money from the wealthy patrons of the [[Canto Bight]] [[casino]] [[city]]. He offered his assistance for a price to the Resistance operatives [[Finn]] and [[Rose Tico]] after learning about their [[Mission to Canto Bight|mission]] to recruit [[Master Codebreaker|a codebreaker]]. Although he helped them [[Attack on the Resistance fleet|infiltrate]] the [[First Order Navy]] [[flagship]] ''[[Supremacy]]'', DJ chose to save his own life after they were [[Prisoner|captured]] by [[Captain]] [[Phasma]] and her [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtroopers]].

==Biography==
==="Don't Join"===
{{Quote|Good guys, bad guys, made-up words. Let's see who formerly owned this gorgeous hunk-uh. Ah, this guy was an arms dealer. Made his bank selling weapons to the bad guys. Oh&hellip; And the good.|DJ, to Finn|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}
[[File:DJ Vanity Fair first look.png|thumb|left|150px|The slicer known as "DJ" was not keen on picking sides.]]
The man known only as "DJ," a nickname that was actually an acronym for his personal motto "Don't Join," lived during the [[New Republic era|era]] of the [[New Republic]]<ref name="Episode VIII" /> as both a [[thief]] and as a [[slicer]]. As reflected in his motto, DJ lacked a belief in the black and white moralities of good and evil, and instead saw shades of gray, where no one was wholly good or wholly evil. The only factions to him were his side or the other's side, with his side being the only one that truly mattered. In his mind, good guys and bad guys simply did not exist.<ref name="DJ:MW">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi &ndash; DJ &ndash; Most Wanted 1]]''</ref> When it came to the factions fighting the [[First Order–Resistance war]], he saw the tyrannical [[First Order]] and the ambitious [[Resistance]] to be two sides of the same coin.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

At some point, DJ took residence in an apartment located in [[Canto Bight]], a [[city]] located on the [[desert]] [[Planet|world]] of [[Cantonica]], a planet known for its [[casino]]s and [[racetrack]]s.<ref name="Canto Bight">{{Databank|canto-bight|Canto Bight|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/3TTzn}}</ref> The city turned into DJ's playground, where he used his slicing skills and equipment to steal [[Currency|money]] from Canto Bight's wealthy.<ref name="Databank" /> He also created a persona called "[[Denel Strench]]," a big time [[gangster]] who held DJ as his last living associate. Strench's name became known through Canto Bight, with a handful of individuals believing Strench to be real. In truth, the persona was created to serve DJ to take the fall for his own crimes. The [[Canto Bight Police Department]]'s record on Strench eventually became the longest in the [[sector]].<ref name="DJ:MW" />

===What happens in Canto Bight===
====Running the tables====
{{Quote|Hit or stand, sir? The droid is right. The book says stand, but it's your call."<br>"Hit me, my m-m-man. ''[Loses hand]'' Oh, well.|The Eclipse dealer and DJ|Star Wars: The Last Jedi – DJ – Most Wanted 1}}
Shortly after the [[Hosnian Cataclysm]]<ref name="DJ:MW" /> in [[34 ABY]],<ref name="Date">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' places the events of the film [[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']] in [[34 ABY]]. As [[Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VIII ''The Last Jedi'']] carries on immediately from the events of ''The Force Awakens'', it can be assumed to take place in the same [[Standard year|year]].</ref> DJ patronized the [[Coruscant Hotel and Casino]], where he hit the gaming tables for [[Eclipse (gambling)|Eclipse]]&mdash;a [[Hologram|holographic]] card game&mdash;with a large sum of stolen money with the intention of stealing even more money by rigging an Eclipse table with virused cash. By uploading corrupted money into the Eclipse table, the game would perform in his favor where the more money he put in, the more money he could withdraw. Ultimately, his plan was to spend a week at [[Zord's Spa and Bathhouse]]. DJ eventually settled for a table where he found himself heckled by the [[gambling]] [[protocol droid]] [[O1-MG]]. Unaware of DJ's scheme, the [[droid]] was dumbfounded by DJ's aggressive betting and the incredible amounts of money he was losing.<ref name="DJ:MW" />
[[File:DJ and Dealer.png|thumb|right|269px|DJ leaves the Coruscant Hotel and Casino after scamming an Eclipse table.]]

The droid ignored DJ's comments to mind his own, and became increasingly vocal as DJ tipped a waitress and the game's [[Zabrak]] [[Unidentified Zabrak Eclipse dealer|dealer]] with all but one of his betting chips. However, the droid's pestering was culled by [[Oosha Choi]] and [[Pol Ipol]], a pair of [[Canto Bight Police Department]] [[detective]]s known as honest cops, and as such derided by DJ as suckers. As it happened, they were there to warn DJ and interrogate him about Denel Strench, whom they believed was after him due to a series of events that began with the detectives hunting down the [[arms dealer]] [[Flestic Crupp]]. However, the officers were put off by DJ's nonchalant attitude and the dismissal of the deaths of the "good men" on their [[squad]]. When Ipol tried to force DJ to come with him, he was stopped by the [[Coruscant]] [[Hotel]] and Casino's owner, [[Jorka Edy]]. The [[officer]]s were kicked out of the casino for harassing a customer, and DJ was left to continue his scam.<ref name="DJ:MW" />

After tipping the dealer again, DJ made for the door, having contacted the [[security]] team of the [[Vesustrian]] resort for an escort to their casino sometime earlier. However, Edy had learned of DJ's scam and followed him out, only to be confronted by Ipol, Choi, and the Vesustrian security team led by a brutish [[security guard]] named [[Dezmoont]]. All three parties avoided making a scene by letting Dezmoont escort DJ to the Vesustrian, with Edy doing so in the hopes that a rival casino would fall to the same scam.<ref name="DJ:MW" />

===="High Roller"====
{{Quote|You don't gotta do anything but enjoy yourself here, High Roll. And on that topic, you even think about pulling whatever you did in the Coruscant Hotel and Casino in here? That's when I clock in for real.|Dezmoont gives DJ a warning upon entering the Vesustrian|Star Wars: The Last Jedi – DJ – Most Wanted 1}}
[[File:Dezmoont and DJ Casino.png|thumb|left|259px|DJ dealing with Dezmoont]]
After welcoming DJ to the Vesustrian, Dezmoont revealed that he was well aware of DJ's abilities and promised to keep a close [[eye]] on him during the duration of his stay. As such, the security [[guard]] stuck himself to DJ's side at every stop DJ made, which included a visitation to a [[fathier]] track, a [[tauntaun]] display, and an upscale [[restaurant]]. Upon learning that DJ was apparently being followed by Strench, however, Dezmoont upped the security surrounding DJ.<ref name="DJ:MW" />

DJ chafed under the constant surveillance, though, and negotiated a deal to get Dezmoont off his back that included giving the guard the go-ahead to beat him into a pulp if Dezmoont caught him cheating. After Dezmoont left, DJ picked up on a game of Eclipse while Dezmoont watched from a [[cam droid]]. While playing, DJ met the [[podracer]] [[pilot]] [[Groff Fordly]], who DJ tended to bet on. In exchange for some chips, Fordly offered to give DJ a ride around the Canto Bight strip in his [[speeder]]. At that point the conversation was inturrupted by Crupp, who had been released from [[prison]] apparently because of Denel Strench, who also told Crupp where to find DJ.<ref name="DJ:MW" />

Although Vesustrian security stepped in before DJ could be harmed, DJ nonetheless became aware that someone was impersonating Strench. Moments later and after DJ accepted Fordly's offer, Dezmoont returned having had DJ's cheating revealed to him, courtesy of Strench. With help from Ipol and Choi, who arrived to belatedly warn DJ about Crupp, DJ evaded Dezmoont's men and took off into Canto Bight with Fordly.<ref name="DJ:MW" />
[[File:Flestic vs DJ.png|thumb|right|200px|DJ is confronted by Flestic Crupp]]

Dezmoont gave chase, though, and followed DJ through the city streets. Fordly protested his involvement in what had become more than just a ride, and as such demanded all of the chips DJ had. DJ complied and handed over 250K worth of chips before ordering Fordly to take a sharp turn that led them into a collision with a parked vehicle. However, the collision occurred in front of Canto Bight [[police officer]]s who arrested the pair, and thus making DJ unreachable to Dezmoont.<ref name="DJ:MW" />

At that moment, the cam droid from the Vesustrian, which had followed DJ throughout the entire speeder chase, confronted the slicer, who recognized the cam droid as being O1-MG. After being kicked from the Eclipse table at the Coruscant, O1-MG, feeling slighted, took off for DJ's apartment and rummaged through his [[computer]] files, where he found the Strench persona: the file was so detailed that when it was downloaded into O1-MG it managed to replace his core data, partially replacing his own identity. Ipol and Choi destroyed O1-MG shortly after, and DJ was placed into a Canto Bight prison.<ref name="DJ:MW" />

===Finn and Rose===
====Leaving Canto Bight====
[[File:DJ in Jail.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|DJ escaped from the Canto Bight prison after offering his service as a codebreaker to Finn and Tico.]]
Whilst this was happening, two [[Resistance]] operatives&mdash;the [[technician]] [[Rose Tico]] and a [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtrooper]] [[Treason|defector]] known as [[Finn]]&mdash;and the [[droid]] [[BB-8]] [[Mission to Canto Bight|traveled to Canto Bight]] in search of a slicer who could neutralize the [[Hyperspace tracker|technology]] which enabled the [[First Order]] to track the [[Resistance navy|Resistance fleet]] through [[Hyperspace]]. However, they were arrested by the [[Canto Bight Police Department]] and locked in a [[prison]] cell with DJ, whose assistance they ultimately accepted after failing to enlist the support of the [[Master Codebreaker]].<ref name="Episode VIII" />

After escaping from Cantonica on the stolen [[yacht]] ''[[Libertine]]'', DJ requested Tico's [[gold]] pendant as payment upfront for his services. Finn was opposed to the price, knowing its [[Paige Tico|sentimental value]] to Tico, but Tico accepted his condition so that the slicer would help their cause. With DJ's help, they infiltrated the [[First Order Navy]] [[flagship]] ''[[Supremacy]]'' which contained the tracking system they sought to disable.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

====Cutting a deal====
Disguised in the [[First Order military uniforms|uniforms]] of [[First Order officer]]s, the infiltrators made their way to the target area where DJ used Tico's pendant to disable a locked door before returning the item to her. At that moment, however, the trio was surrounded by [[Captain]] [[Phasma]]'s [[trooper]]s, having been detected aboard the [[warship]] by the droid [[BB-9E]].<ref name="Episode VIII" />

[[File:UndercoverFO.png|thumb|right|250px|With DJ's help, Finn and Tico infiltrated the ''Supremacy'' while disguised in First Order military uniforms.]]
The [[prisoner]]s were taken to the main [[hangar]], where DJ revealed to Finn and Tico that he had traded information about the Resistance&mdash;including their plan to escape to the planet [[Crait]]&mdash;to [[General]] [[Armitage Hux]] in exchange for his freedom and a large sum of [[Credit|money]]. He then departed from the ''Supremacy'' with his reward, leaving his one-[[time]] allies to be [[Death|executed]] on Phasma's orders. Ultimately, Finn and Tico were both able to survive as a result of the [[Attack on the Resistance fleet|sacrifice]] made by [[Vice Admiral]] [[Amilyn Holdo]], ramming the Resistance flagship [[Raddus (MC85 Star Cruiser)|''Raddus'']] through the ''Supremacy'' at hyperspeed.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Oh, t-t-t-t-take it easy, Big F. They blow you up today, you will blow them up tomorrow. It's j-just business."<br>"You're wrong."<br />"Maybe.|DJ and Finn|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}
As an exceptional slicer and unscrupulous thief, DJ always marauded in the shadows at Canto Bight, frequently stealing the things he needed.<ref name="Databank" /> He could effortlessly pick the lock to a jail cell<ref name="bio gallery">{{Databank|dj-biography-gallery|DJ Biography Gallery}}</ref> or open a sealed door by using a piece of gold.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> According to DJ's personal philosophy, the only way to live a free existence was to not choose a side. He was resolute in his opinions and refused to join the First Order or the Resistance as their rivalry escalated into open war.<ref name="Databank" /> He regarded neither side as good or evil,<ref name="Episode VIII" /> believing that both factions were part of a system built on greed and corruption.<ref name="Databank" />

Although he refused to join a side in the conflict,<ref name="Databank" /> DJ was capable of working with either faction if it suited his interests. He helped the Resistance in their attempt to disable General Hux's tracking system, but ultimately turned against them by cooperating with the First Order in return for his life and the compensation of a reward.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> To bind one's self to any cause, DJ believed, would ultimately lead to their downfall.<ref name="TLJ VD">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> It was all simply "business" in his line of work.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

DJ was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]]<ref name="Databank" /> with [[Color|black]] [[hair]], brown [[eye]]s, and tan skin.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> His philosophy&mdash;encapsulated in the motto "DON'T JOIN"&mdash;was etched into a plate adorning his [[hat]].<ref name="Databank" />
