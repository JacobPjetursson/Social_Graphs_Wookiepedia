'''Rio Durant''' was a four-[[Limb|armed]] [[Ardennian]] [[pilot]] who lived during the [[Imperial Era|reign]] of the [[Galactic Empire]]. Durant carried out dangerous missions alongside the scoundrel [[Tobias Beckett]] for [[Standard year|years]] and was good-natured and up for any challenge.<ref name="Databank" />

==Biography==
Rio Durant was a veteran of [[Freedom's Sons]], an independent [[army]] which assisted the [[Galactic Republic]]'s [[Grand Army of the Republic|Grand Army]] during the [[Clone Wars]], but since it paid no pension, he turned to a life of crime for income and applied his military skills there.<ref name="Official Guide" /> At some time during his life of crime, Rio tried to steel [[Tobias Beckett]]'s and [[Val]]'s speeder but they were impressed and Rio ended up joining Beckett and Val.<ref name="Expanded Edition">''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story: Expanded Edition]]''</ref> They formed a [[Beckett's gang|crew]] which carried out risky though profitable heists.<ref name="Beckett Databank">{{Databank|tobias-beckett|Tobias Beckett|archivedate=20180416223833}}</ref> Over the time, Durant carried out several dangerous missions alongside Beckett, serving as his [[pilot]].<ref name="Databank" />

===I.D. chip heist===
[[File:Durant & sabaac.jpg|thumb|left|262x262px|Rio playing sabacc until Beckett arrived as a death priest.]]
Rio and his compatriots received a message from [[Crimson Dawn]]'s leader [[Dryden Vos]]: Vos wanted [[Dvorad]]'s stash of blank [[Identichip|I.D. chips]]. Rio went with Beckett and Val to [[Hovun IV]]. There, he played [[sabacc]] until Beckett, disguised as a [[death priest]], arrived. Rio pretended to be choked by Beckett, which caused the other players to flee. Rio scooped up the credits while Val placed a tracker on [[Dvorad's speeder]]. Beckett left Rio and Val behind as he jumped on Dvorad's speeder. He and Val caught up with Beckett by stealing a speeder with a bar. Rio got himself drunk as Dvorad summoned his [[Starship|ship]].

[[File:Heist on Hovun IV.jpg|thumb|right|213px|A creature attackes Dvorad and his ship.]]
Rio, Val, and Beckett held their hands up when Dvorad held them at gunpoint. A [[Unidentified creature (Hovun IV)|creature]] then attacked Dvorad and his ship. Rio and Val covered Beckett as he boarded the ship and defended himself against the creature. After escaping from the creature and Dvorad's ship, Rio suggested they should keep some of the I.D. chips for themselves despite Val's concerns about Vos. Rio and the others then boarded the ''[[Rampart (Tobias Beckett)|Rampart]]'' and left Hovun IV.

After taking the ''Rampart'' to [[Munt Ontdal]], Rio, Val, and Beckett were captured by [[Enfys Nest]] and her [[Cloud-Riders]]. Rio and the others tried to convince the riders to let them go before Vos arrived. However, Val realized that the riders had given them their information for the heist. When Beckett refused to surrender the chips, he blew up the ''Rampart''. As they made their escape from the riders, Rio and the others were confronted by stormtroopers. After evading the troopers, Rio posed as a scrambler.<ref name="Beckett 1">''[[Star Wars: Beckett 1]]''</ref>

===Meeting with Han Solo===
[[10 BBY|Ten]] [[Standard year|years]] before the [[Battle of Yavin]], during a [[Mimban campaign|battle]] on the [[swamp]] planet [[Mimban]], Rio infiltrated the [[swamp trooper]]s along with Beckett and Val. There, they met the young [[Han Solo]], who wanted to join their crew. Durant had doubts about letting Solo join them, but Beckett decided to give the boy an opportunity by leading him to be locked up for insubordination. Solo was ultimately able to escape with the [[Wookiee]] [[Chewbacca]], who was initially intended to devour Solo, so Beckett ordered Rio to lower the ship to let Solo and Chewbacca board, causing Rio to become surprised with the Wookiee's presence.<ref name="Solo" />

Once they arrived at [[Vandor]], Beckett's crew spied the [[20-T Railcrawler conveyex transport]] that they had been planning to steal in order to acquire its [[coaxium]] cargo to pay Beckett's debt to Dryden Vos. As the crew spied, they wished for the absence of Enfys Nest and the Cloud-Riders the next [[Standard day|day]]. That night, before sleeping next to the campfire they had made, Durant spoke with Solo, mocking his piloting abilities.<ref name="Solo" />

===The conveyex heist and death===
The next day, while Beckett, Solo, and Chewbacca managed to take possession of the cargo wagon by getting rid of the [[range trooper]]s and having Chewbacca separate it with his strength, Rio positioned the ship in such way to let Solo and Beckett hook the wagon in order to escape with the cargo from the scene.<ref name="Solo" />

Nest and the Cloud-Riders appeared, intending to steal the coaxium from Beckett's hands. The Marauder [[Baroosh Pawk]] managed to board Beckett's ship and shot at Durant. Rio was able to shoot the intruder, killing him, but was fatally shot in his left shoulder by Pawk. Han was then forced to go into the ship to help Durant. Though Rio stated that it wasn't a serious wound, it became evident that Durant was succumbing to it. Anticipating that he was not going to survive, Rio asked Han for forgiveness, saying to the young man that he truly was a better pilot than him. On the verge of his death, Rio proclaimed that Val was correct in her belief that no one should die alone, reaffirming Han's goal of returning to [[Corellia]] to find [[Qi'ra]]. Durant then [[Death|passed away]] from his wounds, leaving Solo to take control of the ship.<ref name="Solo" />

After he and Val died, Beckett had graves placed for them, with Durant's having his goggles hung off the stick that marked it.<ref name="Solo" />

===Legacy===
Although his death seemed to be in vain as Han was forced to drop the coaxium to save Beckett, his death seemed to reaffirm to Han that he should find Qi'ra on Corellia. Also, despite being a smuggler, Han continued to keep Chewbacca around as he realized that a loyal friend was difficult to come by in such a merciless [[The galaxy|galaxy]].<ref name="Solo" />

==Behind the scenes==
Rio Durant is voiced by [[Jon Favreau]] and performed by circus performer [[Katy Kartwheel]] in the [[2018]] [[Star Wars Anthology Series|''Star Wars'' Anthology]] film ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]''.<ref name="Solo" /> Durant is Favreau's second ''[[Star Wars]]'' role; he had previously voiced [[Pre Vizsla]] in six episodes of ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]''.

As revealed in the DVD commentary of ''Solo'', the practical portion of Durant's body was played by Kartwheel, while other parts of his body were done by [[Wikipedia:Computer-generated imagery|CGI]].<ref name="Solo DVD Commentary">''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' DVD commentary</ref> Favreau was brought to voice the character after director [[Ron Howard]] managed to pull him away from his directing duties for the [[Wikipedia:The Lion King (2019 film)|live-action remake]] of ''[[Wikipedia:The Lion King|The Lion King]]''.<ref name="Ron Howard Twitter">{{Twitter|RealRonHoward|status/963873491358441474|[[Ron Howard]]|quote=Wondering why we r all together? @Jon_Favreau is voicing a very cool & important alien character for #HanSolo Flattered & fortunate I could pull him away from his  #LionKing directing duties}}</ref>

Early story outlines for ''Solo'' included an additional member of Beckett's gang, a "squid-monkey" named Zapf, who was eventually amalgamated into Durant's character. An early influence for Durant was actor [[Wilford Brimley]], who coincidentally, played [[Noa Briqualon]] in the [[1985]] [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] TV movie ''[[Ewoks: The Battle for Endor]]'', back when Durant was intended to be a gruff, mustachioed [[alien]] pilot with multiple eyes.<ref name="Art of Solo">''[[The Art of Solo: A Star Wars Story]]''</ref>
