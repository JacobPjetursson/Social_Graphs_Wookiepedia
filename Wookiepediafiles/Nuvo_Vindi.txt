==Biography==
{{Quote|Doctor Nuvo Vindi, the senior medic for the Perma families. He disappeared ten years ago.|[[Gregar Typho]]|audio=DrNuvoVindiSeniorMedic-BSV.ogg|Blue Shadow Virus (episode)}}
Nuvo Vindi was a male Faust from the planet [[Adana]]<ref name="Ultimate Star Wars" /> who lived during the [[Fall of the Republic]]. He eventually became the senior medic for the [[Perma families]]. He then disappeared in [[31 BBY]].<ref name="Blue Shadow Virus" />
===Clone Wars===
Vindi then resurfaced ten years later in [[21 BBY]]. He was then recruited by his friends in the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist Alliance]] to re-create the [[Blue Shadow Virus]]. Vindi was then given a [[Trade Federation laboratory|laboratory]] hidden on Naboo in its [[Eastern swamps]]. There, he was able to re-create the Virus. Vindi was then able to make the Virus airborne and his battle-droids then started to fill the bombs. However, a small amount of the virus had leaked out of the lab and Vindi's tactical droid was then captured by the [[Royal Naboo Security Forces]] under Captain [[Gregar Typho]].<ref name="Blue Shadow Virus" />

Vindi then detected Naboo's senator, [[Padmé Amidala]] and representative, [[Jar Jar Binks]] approaching his lab. Vindi then sent his battle droids to capture them. Vindi then showed them his plans for the Virus as loaded the last bomb and gave it to [[LEP-86C8|his servant droid]].<ref name="Blue Shadow Virus" />
