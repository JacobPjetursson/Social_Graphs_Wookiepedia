{{Quote|And back again, it's the mighty Dud Bolt with that incredible racing machine, the Vulptereen 327!|[[Fodesinbeed Annodue|Fode]]|Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace}}
'''Dud Bolt''' was a [[Vulptereen]] [[Podracer]] [[pilot]] who was known to participate in the [[Boonta Eve Classic]], preferring the use of a [[Vulptereen 327]] Podracer. During a Boonta race that took place shortly before the [[Battle of Naboo]], Bolt raced against a young [[human]] boy named [[Anakin Skywalker]], who would eventually win the Boonta and earn a life free from [[slavery]]. Bolt continued to race up to the start of the [[Clone Wars]], including participation on a [[Water|snow]] covered [[planet]].

==Biography==

[[File:Dud_Bolt_AoC.png|thumb|125px|left|Dud Bolt's Vulptereen 327 was in action on the HoloNet.]]
A short, shovel-nosed<ref name="TPM" /> [[Vulptereen]]<ref name="Force Collection" /> [[Podracer]] [[pilot]], Dud Bolt piloted a [[Vulptereen 327]] Podracer. [[Time|Sometime]] before the [[Invasion of Naboo]], Bolt participated in the [[Boonta Eve Classic]], an annual [[Podracing|race]] held on<ref name="TPM" /> the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]]<ref name="DB-Tat">{{Databank|tatooine|Tatooine}}</ref> [[planet]] [[Tatooine]]. Shortly before the [[Battle of Naboo]], at least a [[Standard year|year]] after the last annual Boonta race, Bolt participated in yet another Boonta. By this time Bolt's Vulptereen 327 was well respected by the [[Troig]] commentators [[Fodesinbeed Annodue|Fode and Beed]]. This year, Bolt's competitors included the [[Xexto]] pilot [[Gasgano]], the vile [[Dug]] [[Sebulba]], and the young [[human]] [[Slavery|slave]] [[Anakin Skywalker]], among fourteen others. Bolt began the race, which was located at the [[Mos Espa Grand Arena]], on the second row of the starting grid. Eventually, the race's host, [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba the]] [[Hutt]], signaled the start of the race.<ref name="TPM" />

Early on, Bolt fell behind the main pack, and was never able to make it close to the lead pilots, who by the third lap were Skywalker, Sebulba, and Gasgano, in that order. Ultimately, Skywalker won the race, while Sebulba crashed shortly before the finish line. As such, with Skywalker's victory came Bolt's inability to win the race.<ref name="TPM" /> However, Bolt continued racing, and several years after the Boonta Bolt participated in a race on a [[Water|snow]] covered planet shortly before the start of the [[The galaxy|galactic event]] known as the [[Clone Wars]]. The race was broadcast over the [[HoloNet News|HoloNet]], and was aired in a club on the planet [[Coruscant]].<ref name="AotC">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]</ref>

==Personality and traits==
Dud Bolt was a short [[Species|alien]] with the fast reflexes one needed in order to be successful in a sport such as Podracing. Bolt had [[Color|bluish-gray]] skin, yellow [[eye]]s, and a flat shovel-nose that had three [[Tooth|tusks]] protruding from either side.<ref name="TPM" />

==Equipment==
Dud Bolt piloted a Vulptereen 327 Podracer, a vehicle that was respected by the Podrace commentators Fode and Beed. Bolt's Podracer [[engine]]s were predominantly red, with the front of the engines being silver and the back ends being blue. Bolt's [[cockpit]] was blue with red glyphs painted on the side.<ref name="TPM" />

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Dud_Bolt_Concept.png|thumb|right|225px|Concept art for Dud Bolt by [[Terryl Whitlatch]]]]
Dud Bolt was created for the [[1999]] film, [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']]. Bolt appeared during the film's [[Podracing]] scenes, both as a puppet for close ups in his cockpit and as a low resolution digital model for distance shots. Unlike most of the Podracer pilots, Bolt did not appear in the film's [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (novelization)|novelization]] by [[Terry Brooks]], making the film Bolt's first appearance in both [[canon]] and [[Star Wars Legends|''Star Wars'' Legends]] timelines. He later briefly appeared in the sequel, [[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']]. Bolt also appeared in several film tie-in [[video game]]s, such as ''[[Star Wars: Episode I Racer]]'' and the ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace (video game)|Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace video game]]''. He also appeared in ''Racer'''s [[2002]] sequel ''[[Star Wars: Racer Revenge]]'' and the [[2012]] video game ''[[Kinect Star Wars]]''. However, these appearances are considered to be part of the Legends timeline, and are no longer a part of proper canon.

Bolt has appeared as an [[action figure]] twice. His first plastic appearance was in [[2006]] as a part of [[Hasbro Inc.|Hasbro's]] ''[[Star Wars: The Saga Collection|The Saga Collection]]''. Bolt was packaged with another Podracer pilot, [[Mars Guo]], and both pilots came with a blaster accessory and removable headgear.<ref name="Toy">{{HasbroCite|set=Star Wars: The Saga Collection|text=|pack=Dud Bolt & Mars Guo|link=tsc051dudmars.asp}}</ref> During the [[2012]] ''[[Star Wars: Movie Heroes|Movie Heroes]]'' line, Bolt and Guo, along with Podracer pilots [[Clegg Holdfast]], [[Teemto Pagalies]], and [[Gasgano]], were released as part of a large multipack. Bolt used the same toy model from earlier, but now with a darker paint job, a new flag accessory, a new base on which to stand on, plus a trading card.<ref name="Toy2">{{HasbroCite|set=Star Wars: Movie Heroes|text=|pack=Podracer Pilots|link=MH-Podracer_pilots.asp}}</ref>
