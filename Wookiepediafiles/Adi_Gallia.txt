'''Adi Gallia''', a [[Force-sensitive]] [[Tholothian]] [[Sexes|female]], was a [[Jedi Master]] and member of the [[Jedi High Council]] during the [[Fall of the Republic|last]] [[Standard year|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic]]. During the [[Clone Wars]], she served as a [[Jedi General]] in the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] and fought several battles over the course of the Republic&ndash;[[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist]] conflict.

In [[21 BBY]] Gallia rescued [[Eeth Koth]]&mdash;a fellow [[Jedi]] Master who had been [[Prisoner|captured]] by [[General]] [[Grievous]]&mdash;with the help of [[Jedi Knight]]s [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] and [[Anakin Skywalker]] during the [[Battle of Saleucami]]. She was [[Death|killed]] [[20 BBY|a year later]] on the [[planet]] [[Florrum]] where Gallia and Kenobi [[Skirmish on Florrum|confronted]] the [[Dathomirian]] [[Nightbrothers]] [[Maul|Darth Maul]] and [[Savage Opress]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Adi Gallia was [[Reproduction|born]] into a high-ranking, diplomatic family stationed on [[Coruscant]].<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" /> A Force-sensitive individual, she was discovered by the [[Jedi Order]] and became a Jedi Master. Gallia earned a position on the Jedi Council,<ref name="AG BG" /> and she warned her colleagues of the [[Trade Federation]]'s suspicious activities in the [[Naboo]] [[Naboo system|system]].<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" />

===The Invasion of Naboo===
[[File:Jedicouncil2.jpg|thumb|left|220x220px|Gallia at the council during the Separatist Crisis|left]]
Gallia was present when [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] went to the [[Imperial Palace|Jedi Temple]] to report an attack by a mysterious warrior whom he believed to be a [[Sith Lord]] to the Jedi Council. Jinn also requested that a boy he found on [[Tatooine]], [[Anakin Skywalker]], be trained as a Jedi, as Jinn believed he was the [[Chosen One]]. Gallia, along with the rest of the Jedi Council, was skeptical of this claim, and even though agreeing to test Skywalker, denied him training because he was too old and has had relationships and is vulnerable to the Dark side of the Force. After Jinn's death at the hands of [[Maul|Darth Maul]] during the Battle of Naboo, Gallia and the Council agreed to allow Obi-Wan Kenobi to train Skywalker as his apprentice to fulfill Jinn's dying wish. Gallia also was present at Jinn's funeral.<ref name="Episode I" />

===The Separatist Crisis===
Adi Gallia continued to serve the Jedi Council during the [[Separatist Crisis]]. In 22 BBY, she and her colleagues approved Obi-Wan Kenobi's investigation of the [[bounty hunter]] [[Jango Fett]], as well as Anakin Skywalker's mission to protect [[Senator]] [[Padmé Amidala]] from those who sought to assassinate her.<ref name="Episode II" />

===The Clone Wars===
Gallia was a member of the [[Jedi]] [[Jedi assault team|assault team]] Mace Windu took with him to [[Geonosis]] in a successful attempt to [[Battle of Geonosis|rescue]] Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Padmé Amidala, who were sentenced to die by [[Count]] [[Dooku]] in [[Petranaki arena]]. Gallia survived what would go down in [[The galaxy|galactic]] history as the first battle of the [[Clone Wars]],<ref name="AG BG" /> and she went on to become a Jedi General in the [[Grand Army of the Republic]].<ref name="AG BG" />

====Mission to Bray====
[[File:Gallia and Kenobi on Bray.JPG|thumb|right|211x211px|Adi Gallia and Kenobi on Bray.]]
During the early days of the [[Clone Wars]], Ada Gallia and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] undertook a [[Mission to Bray|mission]] to the [[planet]] [[Bray]] after the native [[Brayan]]s asked the [[Jedi Order]] for help. During the mission, the [[Jedi]] discovered the presence of both [[Count]] [[Dooku]] and [[Lord]] [[Ravna]], leading to a confrontation that ended in Ravna trapped beneath the ruins of the [[Citadel of Light]] and the Brayans were free from [[Sexes|his]] power.<ref name="Tales from Vader's Castle 2">''[[Tales from Vader's Castle 2: Count Dooku: Prince of Darkness!]]''</ref>

====Rescuing Eeth Koth====
When Eeth Koth was [[Capture of Eeth Koth|captured]] by the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] in 21 BBY, Adi Gallia watched this live through a hologram. The Jedi were disturbed and everyone except, Mace Windu, Anakin Skywalker, and Obi-Wan Kenobi stayed.The Jedi discovered Koth's location on [[Saleucami]] as Wolffe noticed that Koth's hand signals meant he was there. Gallia was surprised as she had previously thought that Koth wasn't located in the sector. She went with Skywalker and Kenobi to rescue him.<ref name="GI">{{TCW|Grievous Intrigue}}</ref>

[[File:AdiAnakin.jpg|thumb|left|252x252px|Adi Gallia and Anakin Skywalker defend themselves against [[BX-series droid commando|commando droids]]]]
Upon arrival Kenobi engaged [[General]] [[Grievous]] while Skywalker and Gallia boarded Grievous' ship to save Koth. After destroying the droids guarding Koth and rescuing him, they rushed to Kenobi. Though the Jedi had planned to capture Grievous while he was engaging with Kenobi on Kenobi's crusier, Grievous managed to escape from the Jedi by getting into an escape pod. Grievous' escape pod had landed on the surface of Saleucami, and while Skywalker and Kenobi went down to the planet to pursue Grievous, Gallia took Koth to a medical frigate.<ref name="GI" />

====Aftermath of the Devaron massacre====
In 20 BBY, along with [[Plo Koon]], [[Saesee Tiin]], and Obi-Wan Kenobi, Adi Gallia examined the corpses of Jedi Master [[Halsey]] and his [[Padawan]], [[Knox]], after [[Delta Squad]] returned them to the Jedi Temple. Gallia theorized the deaths were caused by [[Asajj Ventress]], but she knew Dooku's assassin was believed to have been killed during the [[Battle of Sullust|battle]] of [[Sullust]].<ref name="WotM">{{TCW|Witches of the Mist}}</ref>

====The Battle of Lola Sayu====
Adi Gallia went with Plo Koon, [[Kit Fisto]], and Saesee Tiin to [[Battle of Lola Sayu|rescue]] Obi-Wan Kenobi and his team from [[Lola Sayu]]. Gallia, Fisto, and Tiin took on the [[Lola Sayu defense fleet|blockade]] around the [[planet]] while Koon saved Kenobi and his surviving forces. Fleeing the [[Citadel]], the Jedi returned to Coruscant.<ref name="CR">{{TCW|Citadel Rescue}}</ref>

====Captured by Grievous====
[[File:GalliaVsGrievous-ND.jpg|thumb|right|225x225px|Gallia faces off against General Grievous]]
Gallia's Jedi cruiser was attacked by a Separatist fleet under the command of General Grievous. Gallia battled the [[cyborg]] when he boarded her cruiser, but she was defeated and captured. She watched as Grievous attacked a [[Marauder (Weequay pirate ship)|pirate ship]]. Gallia was soon rescued by Plo Koon, "[[CC-3636|Wolffe]]," and the [[104th Battalion|Wolfpack]]; again, Grievous escaped before he could be taken into custody.<ref name="ND">{{TCW|Nomad Droids}}</ref>

====Skirmish on Florrum and death====
[[File:GalliaImpaled-Revival.jpg|thumb|left|230x230px|Savage Opress mortally wounds Gallia]]
Gallia later aided Obi-Wan Kenobi as he searched the Outer Rim for Darth Maul, a restored Sith Lord, and [[Savage Opress]], his brother. The Jedi tracked their targets to Florrum, and they aided the [[pirate]] [[Hondo Ohnaka]] in a [[Skirmish on Florrum|battle]] against them. Gallia was slain by Savage Opress.<ref name="Revival" /> Her death opened up a seat on the Jedi Council, which was filled by Jedi Master [[Stass Allie]].<ref name="Episode III">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref>

==Personality and traits==
She had a reputation for aggression and was a strict, focused woman. Gallia criticized the outrageous tactics of others, such as Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi, although she rarely condemns them as their actions are effective.<ref name="SWCT">[[Star Wars: Card Trader|''Star Wars'': Card Trader]]</ref> She was also a valuable source of intelligence for the Senate.<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" />

==Powers and abilities==
Adi Gallia was a skilled user of [[Form V]], and she was a talented pilot.<ref name="AEYNTK">''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know]]''</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
Adi Gallia was played by [[Gin Clarke]] in [[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']], and voiced by [[Angelique Perrin]] in ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]''.

There are two conflicting sources regarding Gallia's home world: ''[[Ultimate Star Wars]]'' claims she hails from Tholoth, while ''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded]]'' state she is from Coruscant. At the same time, the old [[Encyclopedia (StarWars.com)|Encyclopedia on StarWars.com]] listed Gallia's height as 1.74 meters. ''Star Wars Character Encyclopedia: Updated and Expanded'' says she stands at 1.84 meters. Since the Encyclopedia on StarWars.com is no longer readily available, this article assumes the latter height is correct.
