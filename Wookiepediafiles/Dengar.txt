{{Quote|Hahahaha! I can't believe I'm gettin' paid for this.|Dengar, heading into battle|Star Wars Battlefront}}
'''Dengar''' was a [[Corellia]]n [[bounty hunter]] operating since the early stages of the [[Clone Wars]]. Dengar participated in an [[Safe cargo objective|operation]] on [[Quarzite]]&mdash;during which he served as a member of [[Krayt's Claw]], a syndicate of hunters including [[Boba Fett]], [[Bossk]], and [[Asajj Ventress]]&mdash;to secure property valuable to Lord [[Otua Blank]] of the planet Quarzite.

Dengar remained active through the [[Galactic Civil War]], during which he was one of several bounty hunters hired by [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] to capture [[Han Solo]], captain of the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. Though Dengar ultimately lost Vader's bounty to his rival/partner Boba Fett, he was later present with Bossk and Fett in [[Jabba's Palace]] on Tatooine during Solo's rescue by [[Jedi Knight]] [[Luke Skywalker]].

==Biography==
===The Clone Wars===
====Safe cargo objective====
{{Quote|So... what do you think is in that box?''"<br />"''Whatever it is, it better be worth all this effort.|Dengar and Asajj Ventress contemplate the contents of the box|Bounty (episode)}}
A [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] from the [[planet]] [[Corellia]],<ref name="Galactic Defense" /> the [[bounty hunter]] Dengar's career was considered to be at its prime during the galaxy-wide [[Clone Wars]] conflict, during which he attained a remarkable track record. He was part of an [[Safe cargo objective|operation]] alongside fellow hunters [[Boba Fett]], [[Bossk]], [[Latts Razzi]], [[C-21 Highsinger]], and [[Oked]]. The hunters were hired to escort a [[subtram]] containing [[Pluma Sodi|cargo]] valuable to [[Otua Blank]], the leader of the [[Belugan]] people of [[Quarzite]]. While preparing for the mission in [[Chalmun's Cantina]], Oked was [[Death|murdered]] by the wayward [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]] user [[Asajj Ventress]], who promptly agreed to take the dead hunter's place on the mission roster.<ref name="Bounty" />

[[File:DengarKageFight-Bounty.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Dengar fights a Kage Warrior]]
Dengar and company set off in Bossk's [[Starship|ship]], the ''[[Hound's Tooth]]'', to Quarzite, where the Belugan [[Major]] [[Rigosso]] transported the team to the train's subterranean loading dock via a space [[Turbolift|elevator]] from an orbital skyhook. Dengar, along with Ventress, were assigned to guard the rear of the train. After unsuccessfully flirting with Ventress, a team of skilled [[Kage Warriors]] boarded the train in an attempt to retrieve the cargo. Dengar managed to fight off many of the attackers due to his skilled [[hand-to-hand combat]] techniques, and even managed to kill two using [[sticky explosive]]s. Dengar was eventually overwhelmed by the attackers and was thrown from the train, landing safely on the subterranean surface. Dengar and his allies, who were likewise thrown from the train, returned to the skyhook to await Ventress, who had betrayed the mission objective by swapping the cargo with Boba Fett, who was bound and gagged. Before departing, she hands over the rest of the team's share of unmarked [[credit]]s.<ref name="Bounty" />

====Working for the Hutts====
{{Quote|Come on, let's get out of here.|Latts Razzi, to her team after their job for the Hutts went south|Eminence (episode)}}
[[File:BountyHunterTableDance-Eminence.png|220px|right|thumb|Dengar and his team surprise the Shadow Collective]]
Dengar was later employed by the [[Hutt]]s alongside Latts, [[Embo]], and [[Sugi (bounty hunter)|Sugi]] as protection on [[Nal Hutta]]. They were present when [[Maul|Darth Maul]], [[Savage Opress]] and the [[Death Watch]] leader, [[Pre Vizsla]] [[Mission to Nal Hutta|came]] to ally with the Hutts. When the plan went sour, the four bounty hunters attacked, though they were pushed by the [[Mandalorian]]'s [[flamethrower]]. The trio soon received reinforcements and attacked. When the battle was clearly lost, Dengar and Latts saved the beaten Embo and Sugi by covering their escape with [[smoke bomb]]s. The group of mercenaries fled the Death Watch and their [[Sith]] allies.<ref name="Eminence" />

===Galactic Civil War===
====Witness at Jabba's palace====
{{Quote|These rebels should just pack it in.|Dengar|Star Wars Battlefront}}
Though weathered and grizzled by [[Standard year|years]] of bounty hunting, Dengar was still active around the time of the [[Attack on Cymoon 1|assault]] on [[Cymoon 1]]. He was present in [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba's]] court when [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]], on a mission to negotiate with the Hutt, arrived at the [[crime lord]]'s [[Jabba's Palace|palace]]. Jabba was briefly [[Force choke]]d by the [[Sith Lord]] and after this Jabba ordered Dengar out the of room so that "negotiations" could commence.<ref name="Darth Vader 1">''[[Darth Vader 1: Vader]]''</ref>

====The Smuggler's Moon====
[[File:Solo shot Dengar.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Dengar is shot in the back by Han Solo]]
Dengar went to a bar on [[Nar Shaddaa]] where he learned from a [[Gungan]] that [[Chewbacca]] was there.<ref name="SW 10">''[[Star Wars 10: Showdown on the Smuggler's Moon, Part III]]''</ref> Dengar then shocked Chewbacca as he and [[C-3PO]] were about to storm [[Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi|Grakkus]] the Hutt's [[Palace of Grakkus the Hutt|palace]]. He demanded that 3PO contact [[Han Solo]]. When 3PO tried to help Chewbacca, Dengar shocked him. Dengar then with Chewbacca, and managed to subdue him. When he demanded Solo's location, he was then stunned by Solo.<ref name="SW 11">''[[Star Wars 11: Showdown on the Smuggler's Moon, Part IV]]''</ref> Despite being outgunned by Solo's [[Millennium Falcon|ship]], Dengar threatened to destroy them all with his [[thermal detonator]]. However, he was then tossed away by Chewbacca.<ref name="SW 12">''[[Star Wars 12: Showdown on the Smuggler's Moon, Part V]]''</ref>

====Hired by Darth Vader====
{{Quote|There will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the ''Millennium Falcon''. You are free to use any methods necessary, but I want them alive.|Darth Vader to Dengar and five other bounty hunters|Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back}}
Dengar survived his encounter with Chewbacca. sometime later he was then secretly hired by [[Darth]] Vader along with [[Black Krrsantan]], [[Zuckuss]], [[Beebox]], [[IG-90]], and C-21 Highsinger to find and return [[Doctor|Dr.]] [[Chelli Lona Aphra|Aphra]].<ref name="Darth Vader 16">''[[Darth Vader 16: The Shu-Torun War, Part I]]''</ref>

[[File:BountyHunters.jpg|220px|right|thumb|Dengar on the bridge of the ''Executor'' in 3 ABY]]
In [[3 ABY]], Dengar was one of the bounty hunters, alongside Boba Fett, Bossk, [[IG-88]], [[4-LOM]], and Zuckuss, summoned to the [[Executor]], the [[Galactic Empire|Imperial]] [[flagship]] of Darth Vader, who resorted to using hunters to track down the ''Millennium Falcon'', the ship of [[Captain]] Han Solo, who slipped away from Vader during the evacuation of [[Hoth]].<ref name="ESB">[[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']]</ref>

Dengar lost out on the bounty to Fett, who delivered the now [[carbonite]]-encased Solo to the Hutt crime lord Jabba on [[Tatooine]].<ref name="ESB" /> Dengar, Bossk, and Fett were later present at Jabba the Hutt's palace when chaos broke loose after the [[Jedi Knight]] [[Luke Skywalker]] arrived to [[Rescue of Han Solo|free]] Solo. Though Fett apparently lost his life after taking a tumble into the maw of the [[sarlacc]] beast during a battle with Luke and Han, Dengar seemingly did not participate in the skirmish.<ref name="ROTJ">[[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']]</ref>

===New Republic===
====Skirmish on Corellia====
[[File:Dengar SaV.png|left|thumb|200px|Dengar stands over two victims]]
{{Quote|Things are changing now. Our profession is about to get marginalized, too. Those rebels won't put up with our special brand of sauce for too long, will they? It's why we gotta band together. Form a proper union. We'll be a force to reckon with.|Dengar, to [[Mercurial Swift]]|Aftermath}}
Some time after the [[Battle of Endor]], Dengar got into a fight with the young bounty hunter [[Mercurial Swift]], in a holoplex rooftop on [[Coronet City]], Corellia. Dengar offered guidance, trying to convince him to join a bounty hunter alliance, but Mercurial refused, claiming he was old and ineffective. Dengar managed to have the advantage, aiming a pistol at his opponent, but was easily distracted and taken down when the hunter pretended to see Boba Fett standing behind him. Mercurial let him live, claiming to have no reason to kill him without a [[bounty]] to his head. The two hunters went on their separate paths, but not before Dengar gave him one last warning, saying times would be different for their kind with the [[New Republic]] in power, with the new government potentially forcing bounties on other bounty hunters.<ref name="Aftermath">''[[Aftermath]]''</ref> Dengar's prediction began to come true when the New Republic began denying services to bounty hunters due to the paranoia following the [[terrorist]] [[Attack on Chandrila|attacks]] that took place on [[Liberation Day (New Republic)|Liberation Day]].<ref name="Life Debt">''[[Aftermath: Life Debt]]''</ref>

====Working for Mercurial Swift====
{{Quote|You forgot one part.''"<br>"''What?''"<br>"''We don't really like you.|Dengar turning against Mercurial Swift|Aftermath: Empire's End}}
In the days leading up to the [[Battle of Jakku]], Dengar along with his fellow bounty hunters Embo and the [[Rodian]] [[Jeeta]] accepted work as Mercurial Swift's crew. Swift wanted to collect the [[Black Sun]] crime boss [[Gyuti]]'s bounty on the [[Zabrak]] [[Jas Emari]], the niece of the hunter Sugi. In the past, Dengar had once worked with Sugi, who had always hated Dengar. Dengar in turn was unpopular among many of his fellow bounty hunters including Swift. After learning that the Hutt crime lady [[Niima]] had taken Jas captive, Dengar and his fellow bounty hunters traveled to Niima's temple of the [[Inner Rim]] world of [[Jakku]] to take Jas into custody.<ref name="Empire's End">''[[Aftermath: Empire's End]]''</ref>

However, Jas escaped from her captors and wounded Swift. She then managed to convince Embo, who was a friend of her aunt Sugi, to allow her to escape in Swift's [[Corellian shuttle]]. Dengar rushed back to the ship to apprehend her but was unable to stop Jas from escaping. After Jas returned with her friend [[Norra Wexley]] and the [[B1 battle droid]] [[Mister Bones]] to Niima's temple, Dengar and his fellow hunters cornered Niima and Jas. Niima had earlier agreed to provide Jas and Norra with Imperial uniforms, an Imperial shuttle, and clearance codes to enter the [[Main Imperial base]] on Jakku out of gratitude for ferrying her back to her temple.<ref name="Empire's End" />

Niima initially refused to hand over Jas and grabbed Swift by the neck. However, Dengar pointed his blaster at Niima's throat and forced the Hutt to give up Jas. While the hunters were preoccupied, Norra and Bones escaped on the Imperial shuttle.<ref name="Empire's End" />

====Teaming up with Jas Emari====
{{Quote|Times, they are a-changing, my little gompers. We're gonna need to watch each others' backs, eh?|Dengar on striking a deal with Jas Emari|Aftermath: Empire's End}}
After taking Jas captive, Dengar and his fellow hunters returned to Swift's shuttle. Swift wanted to depart for Nar Shaddaa to hand Jas to Gyuti but was forced to delay his departure due to the Battle of Jakku. While Jeeta landed the ship in a canyon, Jas tormented Swift. Dengar then demanded that Swift tell them his plan.<ref name="Empire's End" />

When an enraged Swift struck Jas, Dengar mocked Swift, who had sustained a facial scar from Jas' horns. Despite Swift's objections, Dengar indicated that he was willing to listen to Jas' counter-offer. Dengar and Embo reacted positively to Jas' offer that the New Republic would reward them for helping to capture the Imperial [[Grand Admiral]] [[Rae Sloane]], the alleged mastermind behind the Liberation Day attacks. When Dengar opined that working for the New Republic was not exactly "cozy-making", Jas promised to secure them full [[pardon]]s if they worked with her. Jas also promised to share the money with Dengar and Embo.<ref name="Empire's End" />

Swift tried to reassert his authority but Dengar countered that he and Embo did not like him. Dengar clubbed Swift in the head with his blaster. Swift managed to grab Jas by the neck and take her hostage. However, the Zabrak headbutted Swift and then punched him in the middle before throwing him out of the shuttle's door. Disliking Swift and accepting Jas' offer, Dengar complimented her. Embo also expressed agreement. Jeeta, who was piloting the ship, also agreed to to work for Jas. Jas and her new crew then flew to the [[Jakku Observatory]] where they evacuated Norra.<ref name="Empire's End" />

The Battle of Jakku ultimately ended the [[Galactic Civil War]] as a New Republic victory. Following the signing of the [[Galactic Concordance]], Jas managed to secure Dengar, Embo, and Jeeta full pardons and some money from the New Republic. While it was not a huge sum, the money was enough to stop them from killing her and to convince Dengar and his fellow hunters to continue working as Jas' crew. Dengar was particularly pleased by this turn of events and remarked that they needed to watch each others' backs because times were changing.<ref name="Empire's End" />

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Hello, darling. Looks like we're securing the back platform together.''"<br />"''Wonderful.|Dengar and Asajj Ventress|Bounty (episode)}}
Though considered by others to be crude and slovenly, Dengar thought highly of himself, often flirting with females such as Asajj Ventress. His confidence translated into his battle tactics, often taking the fight to the enemy head on with sheer firepower and destruction, which contrasted with the more cunning tactics of hunters like [[Cad Bane]] and Boba Fett. Dengar was known to be quite brutal in combat, going so far as to rush his enemies and beat them to death with his heavy blaster rifle. In addition, he was held in high regard by Fett for his excellent track record of hunting down his marks.<ref name="SWE" />

While Dengar worked with several bounty hunters including Sugi and Mercurial Swift, he was widely disliked by them. Dengar in turn disliked Swift, regarding the younger bounty hunter as arrogant and opportunistic. Jas Emari managed to convince Dengar and his companions Embo and Jeeta to turn against Swift with the promise of financial rewards from the New Republic for hunting down Grand Admiral Sloane and securing full pardons. Dengar knew how to fire a blaster and was also familiar with melee combat.<ref name="Empire's End" />

==Equipment==
Dengar wore plated battle [[armor]] and a turban to cover his head during his missions, a uniform that became very battered by the time he was summoned to Darth Vader's super star destroyer.<ref name="Episode guide">{{SW|url=tv-shows/clone-wars/bounty|text="Bounty" Episode Guide - The Clone Wars}}</ref> His preferred choice of weapon during the time of the Galactic Civil War was a [[DLT-19 heavy blaster rifle]], which was supplemented by the use of mini-grenades in close quarters combat.<ref name="Bounty" /> He also equipped himself with smoke grenades, which he used to cover his team's escape after a job for the Hutts went south.<ref name="Eminence" />

==Behind the scenes==
Dengar was played by British actor [[Morris Bush]] in [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']]. He briefly appears in [[Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VI ''Return of the Jedi'']], although it was unknown if it was still Bush in the role until [[Jeremy Bulloch]] confirmed it in the Celebration Europe II panel, The Fett-Tastic Four. In ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|The Clone Wars]]'' TV series, Dengar was voiced by British actor [[Simon Pegg]], who went on to reprise the role in the video game ''[[Star Wars Battlefront]]''.

In pre-production still photographs from ''Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back'', Dengar is pictured holding a modified WWII-era German [[Wikipedia:MG_34|MG 34]] machine gun. In the film, though, that weapon was held by bounty hunter droid 4-LOM, and Dengar was armed with a modified German [[Wikipedia:MG_42|MG 42]].
