'''A'Koba''', also known as '''URoRRuR'R'R''', was a skilled [[Tusken Raider]] leader who lived on [[Tatooine]] during the [[Galactic Civil War]].

==Biography==
A'Koba<ref name="Rites" /> lived on the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] [[Planet|world]] of [[Tatooine]] during the [[Galactic Civil War]]. Shortly before the [[Battle of Yavin]], A'Koba attacked [[Luke Skywalker]], a local [[moisture farmer]] who, along with [[protocol droid]] [[C-3PO]], was searching for his missing [[astromech droid]] [[R2-D2]]. A'Koba knocked Skywalker unconscious, and the Tusken and his followers began searching Skywalker's [[landspeeder]]. They were scared off by [[Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], who mimicked the call of a [[krayt dragon]] to spook A'Koba and his fellow Tusken Raiders into fleeing.<ref name="Episode IV" />
