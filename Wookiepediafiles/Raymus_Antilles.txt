==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Quote|The war will go on without me. It won't without you.|Antilles, to Leia Organa|A New Hope: The Princess, the Scoundrel, and the Farm Boy}}
[[File:Antilles-SWE.png|thumb|left|200px|A younger Antilles circa 19 BBY.]]
A [[human]] [[Sexes|male]], Raymus Antilles [[Homeworld|hailed]] from the influential and peaceful [[planet]] of [[Alderaan]].<ref name="SWE" /> He was schooled in [[Diplomat|diplomacy]] and became a capable [[starship]] [[pilot]]. Eventually, he came to work for the [[House of Organa]], being entrusted to [[transport]] its members across [[the galaxy]]. As such, he served in the command staff of [[Senator]] [[Bail Organa]], [[Marriage|husband]] to [[Queen]] [[Breha Organa|Breha]] of Alderaan.<ref name="DB" /> Towards the end of the [[Clone Wars]], Antilles piloted the [[CR70 corvette/Legends|CR70 corvette]] ''[[Tantive III]]'' for Bail.<ref name="ROTS">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref>

===Imperial Era===
During the [[Proclamation of the New Order|fall]] of the [[Galactic Republic]] and the early [[Standard day|days]] of the [[Galactic Empire]], Antilles was [[captain]] of the ''Tantive III''. He was present when Bail saved [[Jedi Master]]s [[Yoda]] and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] from the [[Jedi Purge]]. After the [[Reproduction|birth]] of [[Padmé Amidala]]'s [[twin]]s [[Luke Skywalker]] and [[Leia Organa]], Antilles was given charge of Amidala's two [[droid]]s, [[R2-D2]] and [[C-3PO]], and was instructed to [[Memory wipe|wipe]] the latter's memory.<ref name="ROTS" /> Antilles knew that Leia was Bail's adoptive daughter and over the [[Standard year|years]] began to serve her as well as her father, but did not know the truth about her birth parents.{{Fact}}

====Early rebellion====
A [[18 BBY|year]] after the [[fall of the Republic]], Antilles was present when former [[Jedi]] [[Padawan]] [[Ahsoka Tano]] broke onto the ''[[Tantive IV]]'' and into Bail's quarters to discuss joining the rebellion. Concerned about Bail's safety, Antilles abruptly entered Bail's quarters with a security team whilst he was talking to Tano, but Bail assured him that she was a friend. Shortly after, Antilles was having a conversation with Bail in the ''Tantive IV's'' mess hall, when Tano approached the pair to devise a plan to help her remaining friends on the [[moon]] [[Raada]]. Once signaled by Tano, Antilles and the ''Tantive IV'', along with several other transports and [[RZ-1 A-wing interceptor|A-wings]], traveled to Raada to help [[Uprising on Raada|evacuate]] the [[farmer]]s on the moon from Imperial occupation.<ref name="Ahsoka">''[[Ahsoka (novel)|Ahsoka]]''</ref>

===Galactic Civil War===

Still a servant of the Organas, Antilles proved himself an extraordinary leader, as he broke through countless Imperial [[blockade]]s to get supplies to the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. He continued to serve [[Prince]]ss Leia, after she succeeded her [[Parent|father]] as Senator of Alderaan.<ref name="anh-psfb">''[[A New Hope: The Princess, the Scoundrel, and the Farm Boy]]''</ref>

[[File:Antilles.png|thumb|left|250px|Antilles strangled by Darth Vader during his interrogation aboard the Tantive IV.]]
During the [[Battle of Scarif]], Antilles was given the [[Death Star plans|plans]] to the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]] after [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader's]] attack on the ''[[Profundity]]'' and immediately rushed the plans to the princess as they escaped into [[hyperspace]] aboard the ''Tantive IV''.<ref name="Rogue One">''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''</ref> However, Vader's [[flagship]], the ''[[Devastator]]'', followed them. Antilles and Leia learned from the ship's [[technician]]s that their damaged vessel was giving off a special signature that allowed the Empire to track them. Understanding this, Antilles attempted to write three letters, one for his [[Raymus Antilles's wife|wife]], and two for his daughters, but he was never able to find the words. When the ship exited hyperspace, the ''Devastator'' was not far behind. The ship was [[Secret mission to Tatooine|captured]] in the [[Tatoo system]]. The captain was able to [[Death|kill]] several [[stormtrooper]]s before being brought to Vader. A loyal guard to the princess, the captain perished protecting her identity when Vader boarded the [[corvette]] and strangled him. The [[Dark Lord of the Sith|Dark Lord]] then tossed Antilles' lifeless body to the side after the unsuccessful interrogation.<ref name="ANH" /><ref name="Raymus">{{Shortstory|story=Raymus|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
Raymus Antilles was played by [[Peter Geddis]] in the [[1977]] original ''[[Star Wars]]'' film [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']].<ref name="ANH" /> [[Rohan Nichol]] later played Antilles in the [[2005]] film [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']].<ref name="ROTS" /> [[Tim Beckmann]] then played Antilles in the [[2016]] [[Star Wars Anthology Series|''Star Wars'' Anthology]] film ''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''.<ref name="Rogue One" />

For Antilles' appearance in ''Revenge of the Sith'', director [[George Lucas]] proposed [[Denis Lawson]], who played [[Wedge Antilles]] in the [[original trilogy]], to appear as Raymus Antilles as [[Jeremy Bulloch]] had a cameo playing [[Colton (Alderaan)|Colton]]. Lucas cast Nichol, his original choice, after Lawson turned down the offer.{{Fact}}

Rohan Nichol suffered an accidental shaving incident leaving a noticeable nick on his chin that would not stop bleeding prior to filming for ''Revenge of the Sith''. After apologizing to George Lucas for the blemish, the latter jokingly responded that the character "must have gotten it in the [[Clone Wars]]".<ref>{{SWArchive|url=episode-iii/bts/profile/beacon164.html|text=Homing Beacon #164 - Captain Antilles Speaks!}}</ref>
