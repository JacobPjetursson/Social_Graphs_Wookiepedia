{{Quote|I'm one with the Force; the Force is with me.|Chirrut Îmwe|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story}}
'''Chirrut Îmwe''' was a blind [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] [[Reproduction|born]] on the [[moon]] [[Jedha]] in [[52 BBY]]. One of the [[Guardians of the Whills]], an order of spiritual warrior-[[monk]]s, he was active during the [[Imperial Era|days]] of the [[Galactic Empire]] and worked as an itinerant preacher in [[Jedha City]]. Alongside his friend and protector, [[Baze Malbus]], Îmwe became part of a volunteer [[Rogue One (squad)|group]] of [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebels]] tasked with stealing the [[Death Star plans|plans]] of the first [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]]. Îmwe [[Death|died]] during the [[Battle of Scarif]] in [[0 BBY]] after assisting [[Jyn Erso]] and [[Cassian Jeron Andor|Cassian Andor]] in breaking into the Imperial archives.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born in [[52 BBY/Legends|52 BBY]], Chirrut Îmwe lived on the [[moon]] [[Jedha]] where he became a member of the [[Guardians of the Whills]] alongside his longtime friend [[Baze Malbus]].<ref name="Rogue One" /> In [[1 BBY]], one year before they joined the Rebellion, Îmwe's voice was heard by [[Padawan]] [[Ezra Bridger]] in [[World between worlds|a place]] that existed between [[time]] and [[Realspace|space]].<ref name="A World Between Worlds">{{Rebels|A World Between Worlds}}</ref>

===Age of the Empire===
====Joining Saw's Partisans====
Shortly after [[Saw Gerrera]] arrived on Jedha, Chirrut and Baze were approached by [[Beezer Fortuna]], one of Saw's top men. They agreed to join on the condition that the orphanage that their friends ran would get any and all supplies they needed. The partisans greatly underestimated Chirrut's abilities, leaving him out of many missions, until Chirrut proved to them he was of value. As Saw's attacks increased, the Empire began to hurt the citizens of Jedha more. This resulted in more orphans, which meant they needed more supplies, Chirrut and Baze knew that they could not let the orphans remain here, so they struck a deal with the partisans to steal an Imperial [[Sentinel-class landing craft|Sentinel]] ship. However, as they put their plan into motion, Beezer and two other partisans betrayed Chirrut and Baze, attempting the steal the ship for themselves to use it as a giant explosive against the Imperial Star Destroyer that hovered above the city. Chirrut managed to convince Beezer that their movement would gain no more traction if word got out that Saw prevented the escape of the orphans. Ceding to Chirrut's rationale, Beezer surrendered the ship to them. This ended their relationship with Saw, however, leaving them on very bad terms.

====Meeting Jyn Erso====
{{Quote|The strongest stars have hearts of kyber.|Chirrut to Jyn Erso during their first meeting on [[Jedha]].|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story}}
Nineteen [[Standard year|years]] after [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]] turned the [[Galactic Republic]] into the [[Galactic Empire]], Îmwe was outside preaching of [[the Force]] when he met [[Jyn Erso]]. He asked her if she knew what [[Kyber crystal]]s were after sensing she had one on her [[necklace]]; she told him that they were what powered a [[Jedi]]'s [[lightsaber]]. She then left with Captain [[Cassian Jeron Andor|Cassian Andor]].<ref name="Rogue One" />

====Joining the Rebellion====
{{Quote|Are you kidding me? I'm blind!|Chirrut Îmwe, after being blindfolded by Saw Gerrera's insurgents |Rogue One: A Star Wars Story}}
[[File:Chirrut Îmwe with staff.jpeg|left|thumb|245x245px|Chirrut Îmwe on Jedha.]]
Later on, during a [[Battle on Jedha|skirmish]] that took place in [[Jedha City]], Îmwe helped free Andor, Erso and the droid [[K-2SO]] from a group of [[stormtrooper]]s. Using his highly trained hearing to determine the positions of the approaching [[trooper]]s, he attacked them with his staff, knocking them all down in quick succession. Then Malbus shot and [[Death|killed]] stormtrooper reinforcements approaching from behind Îmwe. After learning why Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor were there, a group of [[Saw Gerrera]]'s [[Partisans|insurgents]] came and placed sacks on all their heads, to which Îmwe remarked with annoyance because he was already blind and could not see where they were taking him anyway.<ref name="Rogue One" />

[[File:Chirrut Îmwe in Saw Gerreras hide out.png|thumb|264x264px|Chirrut Îmwe in Saw's hideout.]]
They were taken to [[Catacombs of Cadera|Gerrera's hideout]] and placed into a cell. In the cell Îmwe repeated the phrase, "I am one with the Force. The Force is with me." Malbus didn't believe that Îmwe's praying would work to open the cell door. Îmwe asked Andor if he had been in any other cells before to which Andor told him it was his first one. He told him there was more than one type of cell and that he sensed that Andor carried his around with him everywhere he went. Îmwe then sensed that there was someone in the cell beside them. It turned out to be the Ex-Imperial Pilot [[Bodhi Rook]]. They eventually made their escape as the Jedha City was attacked by the Empire's [[superweapon]], the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]]. Îmwe made his escape with the others aboard the U-wing.<ref name="Rogue One" />

====Mission to Eadu====
[[File:Baze aims his gun on Eadu.png|thumb|248x248px|Îmwe with Malbus on Eadu.|left]]
While on board the U-Wing, Îmwe questioned Malbus about the holy city to which he told him that it had been completely destroyed. Jyn told Andor about the weakness that her father had placed in the Death Star and the group made their way to Eadu. Once on the planet, Andor and Rook went out to scout the refinery. After asking Baze if Andor looked like a killer, Baze told him that he looked like a friend. Erso questioned this and Îmwe told her that the Force flows darkly around a creature that is about to kill. Fearing that Andor was going to kill her father she went out in search of him. Moments prior to Erso's departure, K-2SO recalled that Andor's weapon was set in its sniper configuration, supporting Erso's fear that Andor was planning to kill her father. Îmwe later followed Erso. Baze soon followed. Baze and Îmwe stopped at a ridge to get a good look at things. Once the Rebel fighters arrived, Îmwe used his [[Chirrut's lightbow|lightbow]] to take down a TIE Fighter which crashed into a turbo laser tower. Soon after Baze and Îmwe made their way to the shuttle that K-2SO had stolen and made their way to Yavin 4.<ref name="Rogue One" />

====Battle of Scarif====
{{Quote|Chirrut! Don't go! Don't go!"<br>"It's okay...it's okay. Look for the Force...and you will always find me."<br>"The Force is with me...and I am one with the Force.|Chirrut's dying exchange with Baze.|Rogue One: A Star Wars Story}}
[[File:Chirrut Îmwe fires his light bow.png|thumb|253x253px|Chirrut Îmwe firing at Imperials during the Battle of Scarif.]]
After the Alliance Council had told Jyn Erso that they could not afford to send the Rebel Fleet to [[Scarif]], Îmwe was among those who chose to fight with her. Once they arrived on the planet, Îmwe and Malbus were put in charge of an assault team that would set charges to lure out the stormtroopers. After taking out several troopers, they made their way to the entrance to the complex. Îmwe and Malbus held the line with other Rebels until [[All Terrain Armored Cargo Transport]]s arrived at their position. Îmwe and the others ran for shelter. After learning that the master switch needed to be flipped for the Rebels to receive the Death Star plans, he made his way out onto the battle field to activate the switch, continuing to repeat the chant, "I am one with the Force. The Force is with me." Managing to not be hit by any blaster bolts, Chirrut activated the switch as a fuel container was hit by Imperial blaster fire and an explosion occurred, sending him flying backwards. Malbus, seeing his friend injured ran onto the battlefield to help, firing at every trooper. Îmwe soon died in his friend's arms, but told Malbus not to grieve: if Malbus looked to the Force, he would always be able to find him.<ref name="Rogue One" />

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Chirrut and Baze concept art by Glyn Dillon.png|thumb|right|180px|Concept art of Chirrut Îmwe (left) alongside Baze Malbus]]
Chirrut Îmwe is portrayed by [[Donnie Yen]] in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' stand-alone film ''[[Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''. Director [[Gareth Edwards]] allowed Yen to flesh out the character as he saw fit. One of the traits that Yen created for his character was Îmwe's blindness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jetsetmag.com/exclusive/interviews/inspired-man-donnie-yen/|title=Inspired Man: Donnie Yen|accessdate=December 19, 2016|author=Fahlman, Ty|date=November 2, 2016|work=Jetset Magazine}}</ref>

The role played by Baze and Chirrut in the final film replaced that of the aliens [[Moroff|Senna]] and [[Lunak]]. Lunak was cut entirely from the film, while Senna eventually became the [[Gigoran]] [[Partisans|Partisan]] [[Moroff]].<ref name="rogueart">''[[The Art of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story]]''</ref>
