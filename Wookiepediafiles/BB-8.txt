{{Quote|Such a ''clever'' little droid.|[[Agent]] [[Terex]]|Poe Dameron 12: The Gathering Storm, Part V}}
'''BB-8''', sometimes spelled and pronounced '''Beebee-Ate''' and nicknamed '''BB''', was a [[BB-series astromech droid]] who operated approximately thirty [[Standard year|years]] after the [[Battle of Endor]]. It had a dome head, similar to that of [[R2 series astromech droid]]s, with the bulk of its body made up of a ball on which the droid's head rolled. BB-8 was mostly [[Color|white]], with some silver and orange on its body, as well as a black [[photoreceptor]]. The droid belonged to [[Resistance]] [[pilot]] [[Poe Dameron]], whom he accompanied during his flights on his [[T-70 X-wing starfighter]].

==Biography==
===New Republic service===
A [[BB-series astromech droid]]<ref name="Episode VII" /> who operated in [[34 ABY]],<ref name="Galactic Atlas">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]''</ref> BB-8 became the companion of the [[New Republic]] [[Commander]] and flight leader of [[Rapier Squadron]], [[Poe Dameron]]. During one of Rapier Squadron's routine patrols in the [[Mirrin sector]], BB-8 and Poe's squadron responded to a distress message from the freighter ''[[Yissira Zyde]]'', which had been [[Suraz engagement|boarded and hijacked]] by the [[First Order]], a remnant of the [[Galactic Empire|Old Empire]]. Rapier Squadron failed to stop the First Order from escaping with the ''Yissira Zyde'' and its cargo of high-capacity charging areas. One of the Rapier pilots [[Muran]] was killed when the hyperspace wave generated by the ''Yissira Zyde'' slammed into his [[T-85 X-wing]].<ref name="BTA" />

[[File:BB-8 PatMS.png|250px|left|thumb|BB-8 during the skirmish in OR-Kappa-2722]]
Despite receiving orders from [[Major]] [[Lonno Deso]] not to intervene, Poe Dameron decided to track down the ''Yissira Zyde''. BB-8 accompanied Poe on an errant mission to pursue the First Order. Prior to departing on the mission, Poe got his fellow pilots [[Karé Kun]] and [[Iolo Arana]] to [[comlink]] their [[astromech droid]]s to his starfighter and upload all telemetry from the Suraz engagement into BB-8. Using the combined data stored in BB-8, Poe decided to randomly visit the five places that the ''Yissira Zyde'' had traveled to. At the third stop, BB-8 picked the [[OR-Kappa-2722]] star system. BB-8 squealed in fright when their ship exited [[hyperspace]] near a fleet of [[First Order Navy]] warships.<ref name="BTA" />

BB-8 managed to track down the stolen freighter to one of the [[Star Destroyer]]s. Following a [[Skirmish in OR-Kappa-2722|pursuit]], Poe managed to escape into hyperspace and return to [[Mirrin Prime]]. Upon returning to the [[Mirrin Prime Republic Base]], BB-8 and Poe were detained by [[Shore police]], who brought Poe before [[General]] [[Leia Organa]], the leader of splinter faction of the [[New Republic military]] that monitored the activities of the First Order. BB-8 followed Dameron when he left the New Republic fleet and joined the Resistance. Poe was joined by Karé and Iolo.<ref name="BTA" />

Poe and his fellow pilots later undertook a [[Operation: Sabre Strike|secret mission]] to hijack [[Senator]] [[Erudo Ro-Kiintor]]'s yacht ''[[Hevurion Grace]]'' in order to obtain data that he was planning to transmit to the First Order. BB-8 did not take part in the mission because Poe had to fly a vintage [[Z-95 Headhunter]] which lacked an [[astromech socket]]. As a result of the mission, the Resistance discovered that Ro-Kiintor was colluding with the First Order and the existence of the explorer [[Lor San Tekka]], whom Leia believed could help them find her brother [[Luke Skywalker]].<ref name="BTA" />

===Work in the Resistance===
====Mission to Ovanis====
Following the events of Operation: Sabre Strike, General Organa assigned Poe Dameron on a secret operation to [[Hunt for Lor San Tekka|search]] for Lor San Tekka. BB-8 accompanied his master on this operation. They were joined by the [[Galactic Civil War]] veterans [[Temmin Wexley]] and [[L'ulo L'ampar]], Karé Kun, and Jess Pava, whom Poe formed into a squadron called [[Black Squadron (First Order)|Black Squadron]]. For their [[Mission to Ovanis|first mission]], Black Squadron traveled to the rocky world of [[Ovanis]] where Lor San Tekka had visited the [[Crèche (culture)|Crèche]] a long time ago. While Poe talked with the [[Unidentified Crèche elder|Crèche elder]], BB-8 discovered a [[homing beacon|tracker]] on Poe's [[T-70 X-wing starfighter]]. Poe realized that the First Order had learned of their mission and convinced the Crèche cultists to hide him and BB-8.<ref name="PD 1" />

While the Crèche elder tried to distract [[Agent]] [[Terex]] and his [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtroopers]], Poe and BB-8 hid with their starfighter in one of the smaller caves within the [[Cave of the Crèche]]. When Terex torched the [[Crèche egg]], Poe surrendered himself and confronted Terex.<ref name="Poe Dameron 2">''[[Poe Dameron 2: Black Squadron, Part II]]''</ref> After the Crèche egg hatched and released a [[Unidentified Crèche creature|large blue winged creature]] that attacked everyone, BB-8 stole Terex's [[blaster]] when Poe attacked him. Poe tried to force Terex to call off his forces from Ovanis but Terex fought back. The blue winged creature was then attacked and killed by a black winged creature. BB-8 managed to stun Terex with his electro-pod.<ref name="Poe Dameron 3">''[[Poe Dameron 3: Black Squadron, Part III]]''</ref>

Poe managed to force Terex to call off his forces from Ovanis. BB-8 was present with Poe and the other Black Squadron pilots when Poe made the decision to release Terex and his surviving stormtroopers in order to avoid war between the New Republic and First Order. After the Crèche cultists departed for their new home on the back of the black winged Crèche creature, Black Squadron refueled their starfighters and departed into space. Once in space, Poe reassured BB-8 that the Crèche elder had told him where Lor San Tekka had gone when he had left Ovanis.<ref name="Poe Dameron 3" />

====Mission to Megalox Beta====
After returning to the [[Resistance base]] on [[D'Qar]], Poe chatted with BB-8 about the First Order tracker on his ship. Poe reassured BB-8 that he believed that none of his fellow Black Squadron pilots were traitors. He also told BB-8 that General Organa had assigned [[C-3PO]] and his droid spy newtork to ferret out the spy. Poe told BB-8 to focus on flying straight and not to go "all droid detective." For their [[Mission to Megalox Beta|next mission]], BB-8 accompanied Black Squadron to [[Megalox]] [[prison]] on the planet [[Megalox Beta]]. Poe planned to question the prisoner [[Grakkus]] about Lor San Tekka's whereabouts.<ref name="Poe Dameron 4">''[[Poe Dameron 4: Lockdown, Part I]]''</ref>

While Poe and the other pilots ventured into the prison,<ref name="Poe Dameron 4" /> BB-8 and the other astromech droids [[O-R10N]], [[R2-HA]], and [[R4 (Black Squadron)|R4]] stayed with their starfighters aboard the space station. After the mission was complicated by the presence of Terex, Poe instructed BB-8 and the droids to implement Operation Upside. To gain leverage over both Grakkus and Terex, Poe planned to use the droids to deactivate the space station's gravity field, which protected the prison from Megalox Beta's heavy gravity. Poe wanted to rescue Terex in order to obtain the information about Lor San Tekka.<ref name="Poe Dameron 5">''[[Poe Dameron 5: Lockdown, Part II]]''</ref>

Proceeding with their mission, the droids began accessing a control panel. When several prison guards arrived, they activated their [[rocket booster]]s. When R4's rocket booster's malfunctioned and crashed into a guard, the other droids were forced to knock out the guards. The four droids soon made their way to [[Deck Twelve]] but their presence was noticed by a security droid. The security droid crushed O-R10N and threw him down the bridge.<ref name="Poe Dameron 5" /> BB-8 managed to fight the security droid and used his electric cable to electrocute the droid, short-circuiting it.<ref name="Poe Dameron 6">''[[Poe Dameron 6: Lockdown, Part III]]''</ref>

The three surviving droids were then able to deactivate the deflector shield, foiling Terex's plan to storm Grakkus' [[Fortress of Grakkus the Hutt|fortress]] with hired criminals. Black Squadron, who donned [[gravity belt]]s, were able to rescue Grakkus and convinced [[Warden]] [[Luta]] to let them leave with the Hutt. BB-8 and the other droids then reunited with their pilots. BB-8 personally informed [[Jessika Pava]] about the loss of O-R10N. After leaving on their starships, BB-8 remotely reactivated the station's gravity field. When Terex attacked the space station and blasted several shuttles, Black Squadron turned around and attacked his ship ''[[Carrion Spike]]'', forcing Terex to retreat. They then returned to the Resistance base.<ref name="Poe Dameron 6" />

====Mission to Kaddak====
Following the events on Megalox Beta, Poe suspected that he had a spy among their ranks and distrusted his fellow Black Squadron pilots.<ref name="Poe Dameron 8">''[[Poe Dameron 8: The Gathering Storm, Part I]]''</ref> BB-8 stayed behind at the Resistance base on D'Qar while Poe undertook a [[Skirmish on Pheryon|solo mission]] to meet with the [[journalist]] [[Suralinda Javos]], who had incriminating information on the First Order.<ref name="Poe Dameron 7">''[[Poe Dameron 7: The Gathering Storm]]''</ref> While Poe was working out in the gym, he confided his suspicion that Terex had a spy among Black Squadron. Poe admitted he was sad and angry at Terex for sowing discord among his friends.<ref name="Poe Dameron 8" />

After General Organa assigned Poe to escort her spymaster C-3PO on a [[Mission to Kaddak|mission]] to recover a [[Resistance spy droid network|droid spy]] on the planet [[Kaddak]], BB-8 accompanied Poe, C-3PO and the Resistance technician [[Oddy Muva]], the only one whom Poe trusted. They traveled to Kaddak in a [[freighter]] to avoid drawing attention.<ref name="Poe Dameron 8" /> Unknown to everyone else, Oddy Muva had been blackmailed by Agent Terex into spying on Black Squadron. Terex had taken Oddy's wife [[Sowa Chuan]] hostage.<ref name="Poe Dameron 12">''[[Poe Dameron 12: The Gathering Storm, Part V]]''</ref>

On Kaddak, BB-8 and the others headed to a cantina on [[the Sliver]]'s [[Level 45]]. When the group encountered a [[MSE-6 series repair droid|mouse droid]], BB-8 allowed the droid to access his terminal while C-3PO explained that the mouse droid had found that their spy droid had been captured by the [[Ranc gang]]. The group traveled to the Ranc gang's headquarters where the gangsters [[stun]]ned Poe and surrounded the rest of the part.<ref name="PD9">''[[Poe Dameron 9: The Gathering Storm, Part II]]''</ref> However, C-3PO turned the tables on the gangsters by activating his hidden spy droids. As a result, they were able to rescue the spy droid [[N1-ZX]], a [[BX-series droid commando]]. N1-ZX refused to give the information until he had safely been delivered back to the Resistance base.<ref name="Poe Dameron 10">''[[Poe Dameron 10: The Gathering Storm, Part III]]''</ref>

Heading back to the freighter, the group were pursued by locals who wanted to collect Terex's bounty on Poe. They were separated from Oddy Muva but managed to return to the freighter. The droids and Poe traveled in Poe's T-70 X-wing ''Black One''; with BB-8 sitting in his astromech socket and the other droids residing in storage compartments built into the ship's [[S-foils]]. Oddy Muva meanwhile stowed aboard Terex's ship ''Carrion Spike'',<ref name="Poe Dameron 10" /> intent on rescuing his wife Sowa Chuan and breaking Terex's grip on his life.<ref name="Poe Dameron 12" />

During the journey, BB-8 and C-3PO listened as Poe voiced his suspicion that Oddy Muva was Terex's spy and that the information that N1-ZX was carrying was a ploy by Terex to find the Resistance base. Poe dropped out of hyperspace above a [[Unidentified desert planet (Cold war)|desert planet]] to test the latter theory. As expected, Terex's ship ''Carrion Spike'' and a fleet of Ranc gang "[[Ugly|Uglies]]" appeared. Poe's X-wing was shot down and crashed on the desert planet.<ref name="Poe Dameron 11">''[[Poe Dameron 11: The Gathering Storm, Part IV]]''</ref>

BB-8 and his comrades managed to evade Terex's Uglies by fleeing into a cave. Once inside, BB-8 sought to delay Terex and his landing party by attaching himself to a stalactite. When Terex and his gang arrived, BB-8 collapsed a stalactite on top of the group. BB-8 used his cable to dodge the gangsters' blasters. Terex however recognized BB-8 from their encounter on Ovanis and shot down the cable holding the droid. BB-8 fell much to the distress of Poe and C-3PO.<ref name="Poe Dameron 12" />

Later, BB-8 resurfaced and electrocuted Terex before he could kill Poe during in a confrontation in the cave. Poe thanked BB-8 for saving his life and patted him. Meanwhile, Oddy Muva managed to free his wife Sowa and the slaves aboard the ''Carrion Spike''. Poe's Black Squadron comrades arrived and fought with the Ranc gang fleet. Despite the death of L'ulo, the squadron managed to provide covering fire for Oddy's escape pods to land on the desert planet. Terex's criminal fleet was wiped out by a First Order fleet led by Commander [[Malarus]]. Malarus had been dispatched to apprehend Terex for insubordination. BB-8 was present when Poe handed Terex to Commander Malarus.<ref name="Poe Dameron 13">''[[Poe Dameron 13: The Gathering Storm, Part VI]]''</ref>

===Adventures with Kazuda===

====Meeting Kazuda====
After accompanying Dameron on many missions for the Resistance,<ref name="DB:BB-8" /> six months prior to the conflict with the First Order, Poe and BB-8 found [[Kazuda Xiono]], a young New Republic X-wing pilot, squaring off against the First Order TIE pilot [[Major]] [[Elrik Vonreg]], who had ambushed him and his companions while they were transferring critical information from the New Republic to the Resistance. Struck by Kazuda's bravery and skill, Poe instructed Kazuda to work as a spy on the [[Colossus]] refueling station on the planet [[Castilon]], and also loaned BB-8 out to him.

====Arrival on the Colossus====
After arriving on Castilon, Kazuda and BB-8 met some of the Colossus' residents, including mechanics [[Jarek Yeager]] and [[Tam Ryvora]], the [[Nikto]] [[Neeku Vozo]], the pilot [[Torra Doza]], and the shop owners [[Flix]] and [[Orka]]. BB-8 assisted Kazuda in repairing the broken ship the [[Fireball (starship)|Fireball]], which Kazuda planned to use for racing. He also assisted Kazuda in getting accustomed to life in this unfamiliar area.

===First Order-Resistance Conflict===

====Mission to Jakku====
{{Quote|You take this. It's safer with you than it is with me. You get as far away from here as you can. Do you hear me? I'll come back for you! It will be alright.|Poe Dameron, to BB-8|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}
At some point after accompanying Kazuda, BB-8 returned to Poe. He went with his master to [[Tuanul]] on [[Jakku]] to meet with Lor San Tekka. While Dameron spoke to Tekka in his hut, BB-8 waited outside and saw four First Order [[AAL-1971/9.1 Troop Transport|Atmospheric Assault Landers]] approach. He then alerted his master of the Order's arrival, so Tekka handed Dameron a memory drive containing a map to [[Jedi Master]] Luke Skywalker's location. BB-8 and Dameron then fled to their T-70 X-wing starfighter, but before they could escape, stormtroopers disabled its [[engine]]s. Unable to escape, Dameron gave BB-8 the map and an order to get as far away as possible, which BB-8 did.<ref name="Episode VII" />

====On the Run====
{{Quote|It's easy, buddy. You do good things, and good things will come back to you.|Poe Dameron to BB-8|BB-8 on the Run}}
With BB-8's tracking mode disabled prior to landing on Jakku,<ref name="TFA VD" /> the droid had no choice but to find his own way through the desert alone, presuming his master dead and the success of the mission resting solely on him. Resting in a wreck for the night, BB-8 recalled how Poe Dameron had told him that good things happened to those who did good things for others.<ref name="BB-8 on the Run">''[[BB-8 on the Run]]''</ref>

Setting off across the desert the next morning, BB-8 encountered a [[Teedo (Niima Outpost)|Teedo]] begging for help in freeing his [[luggabeast]] from a sandpit. Remembering Poe's words begging who proceeded to capture him and feeling sorry for the two, BB-8 went to help. Unfortunately it was a ruse. Falling though a trap door hidden in the sand, BB-8 found himself trapped in an underground cell, where Teedo planned to keep him to disassemble him for his parts.<ref name="BB-8 on the Run" />

Inside the cell, BB-8 befriended Teedo's other prisoner, a large loading droid named [[F3-ZK]]. F3-ZK belonged to a [[Droid scout ship|droid ship]] on a scouting mission before he was captured. The ship would be leaving that afternoon. Using a loose panel in the cell's floor, BB-8 and F3-ZK tricked Teedo into falling into a hole allowing them to escape. However, that didn't hold Teedo for long, as he was able to pursue the two droids as they raced for the ship.<ref name="BB-8 on the Run" />

However, the droids had bigger problems when they encountered a flock of [[steelpecker]]s. Knowing BB-8 had an important mission, F3-ZK made the birds follow him, leaving BB-8 to continue to the ship alone. Along the way, he encountered a [[Aleena]] [[scavenger]] family. The mother begged BB-8 for help finding food for her two children. Remembering that there had been ration packets in the wreck he'd spent the night in, BB-8 took them back to that wreck. Despite it being in the opposite direction of the droid ship, BB-8 hoped he could make it if he hurried.<ref name="BB-8 on the Run" />

Leaving the Aleenas with the rations, BB-8 went on his way again. En route, he found a [[happabore]] who'd injured its leg. Remembering that he had passed a wrecked medical ship with first aid supplies. However, going back for them would probably delay him enough that he would miss the droid ship's takeoff. However, the happabore's pain from its injuries made BB-8 decide to help anyways. Retrieving a medical kit, BB-8 bandaged the happabore's leg, receiving a lick and kiss from the grateful creature.<ref name="BB-8 on the Run" />

Despite all the delays, BB-8 made it to the droid ship just as it was ready to take off, as had F3-ZK, who had escaped the steelpeckers. Unfortunately, Teedo had also caught up with them and blocked the way. Remembering how F3-ZK had saved him from the steelpeckers, BB-8 ordered F3-ZK to leave on the ship while he ran out into the desert, leading Teedo with him. As the droid ship left Jakku, Teedo caught up with BB-8, capturing the little droid in a net. Dragged away by Teedo's luggabeast, BB-8 wondered why things had gone so wrong, despite him following Poe Dameron's advice.<ref name="BB-8 on the Run" />

====Meeting Rey====
{{Quote|Yes, there's a lot of sand here. Beebee-Ate? Okay. Hello, Beebee-Ate. My name is Rey. No, just Rey. Look, you're not going to talk all night, are you? Because that won't work. You know how humans recharge. We don't plug in: We sleep. Good. Keep that in mind and we'll get along 'til morning.|Rey to BB-8|Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)}}
BB-8 struggled to escape from Teedo's net. The commotion attracted the attention of [[Rey|scavenger]], who intervened and convinced the [[Teedo]] to leave BB-8 alone. Straightening his bent antenna, although she wasn't able to completely fix it,<ref name="Survival Guide">''[[Rey's Survival Guide]]''</ref> the scavenger casually asking where he had come from. Claiming that that was classified, she didn't probe any further, then gave him directions to [[Niima Outpost]].

However, BB-8 insisted on traveling with the scavenger. After protesting, she reluctantly relented, agreeing to let him stay for the evening before sending him on his way the next morning. Lead to the [[Hellhound Two|walker]] she used as a home, BB-8 introduced himself to the scavenger by name, who identified herself as "Rey."<ref name="Episode VII" /> Unbeknownst to them, BB-8 had become the target of a determined search by the Resistance, the First Order and the [[The galaxy|galactic]] underworld.<ref name="DB:BB-8" />

====The Nightwatcher Worm====
{{Quote|How did I find you? I'm just lucky, I guess. Unlike you, my little friend.|Rey to BB-8|Sands of Jakku}}
Shortly into their journey, BB-8 and Rey were followed by a [[nightwatcher worm]] seeking its next meal. The pair were pursued, with BB-8 being briefly swallowed by the worm and then spit out. Rey and BB-8 were then able to make it to Rey's walker. Seeing that the worm was just a creature trying to survive in the desert, just like them, Rey kindly gave it some spare scrap to eat instead. The worm took the scrap and peacefully left.<ref name="Sands of Jakku">{{FOD|Sands of Jakku}}</ref> BB-8 and Rey then went inside the walker to clean off the slime they had gotten on themselves.<ref name="FODDAV1">''[[Forces of Destiny: Daring Adventures: Volume 1]]''</ref> BB-8 spent the night in the walker quietly, save for being briefly "awakened" by Rey going out for some air after a nightmare.<ref name="TFA Junior Novel">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens: A Junior Novel]]''</ref>

====Bandits====
{{Quote|Turns out you're quite a popular droid.|Rey to BB-8|BB-8 Bandits}}
The next morning, Rey prepared to take BB-8 to Niima Outpost on her speeder; the settlement was the most likely place that anyone looking for BB-8 would go to. However, before they could start out, a glint of metal caught Rey's attention; Teedo had come back for BB-8 and he had brought two bandits with him as backup.<ref name="BB-8 Bandits">{{FOD|BB-8 Bandits}}</ref>

Fleeing on the bike with BB-8 in tow and Teedo's bandits in pursuit, Rey was able to force two of the bandits to crash into each other's [[speeder bike]]s in the Graveyard. Teedo wasn't so easy to shake off, though. At BB-8's suggestion, Rey piloted them to the nightwatcher worm's den in the bowls of a wrecked Star Destroyer. Parking the speeder, Rey and BB-8 waited as Teedo followed them in. Before the bandit could shoot them with a blaster, the worm surfaced, eating the bike. Thrown clear, Teedo fled. Thanking the worm, BB-8 and Rey continued on their way to the outpost.<ref name="BB-8 Bandits" />

====Niima Outpost====
{{Quote|Plutt wants droid. We take droid. Female don't interfere''"<br />"''The droid is mine. I didn't sell him. Plutt knows that.''"<br />"''You right. Plutt knows that. You didn't sell. So he take.|Unkar Plutt's thugs and Rey|Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)}}
Reaching Niima, Rey assured BB-8 that he couldn't give up despite his master not being found right away, drawing a parallel to her own personal wait for her family to come back to Jakku. In the meantime, she had the little droid follow her while she went to sell salvage to Unkar Plutt.<ref name="Episode VII" /> On the way, BB-8 caught Rey crying (thinking about her missing family), which the scavenger denied.<ref name="TFAn">[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)|''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' novelization]]</ref> BB-8 gently teased her about it all the way to Plutt's stand, by which point Rey herself was able to laugh at it, too.<ref name="Rey's Story" />

When their turn at Plutt's stand arrived, the [[Crolute]] became interested and offered to buy BB-8; while tempted, Rey declined the offer, to Plutt's anger.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Immediately leaving Plutt's stand, Rey took BB-8 on a meandering course until they had put enough distance between them. Profusely thanking Rey for not selling him, BB-8's steady stream of chatter was interrupted by the young scavenger; she couldn't help him further if she didn't know what exactly he was waiting for. Thinking for a moment, BB-8 asked if he could trust her, earning an angry response from Rey at being asked that after all she had done for him since they met. Apologetic, BB-8 told her everything, about Poe, the Resistance, the First Order, and the destruction of the Sacred Village. His story was interrupted by a pair of [[Unkar's thugs|thugs]] who had come to steal BB-8 for Unkar Plutt, who put him in a sack. Despite warning her not to interfere, Rey fought back.<ref name="TFAn" />

[[File:Finn and Rey Jakku Escape.png|right|thumb|230px|BB-8, Finn, and Rey notice Stormtroopers looking for the droid.]]
Defeating the thugs, Rey helped BB-8 out of the sack. He immediately noticed a man nearby wearing Poe's [[Resistance fighter jacket|jacket]], prompting Rey to chase after the man, [[Finn]]. Knocking him over with a staff, Rey questioned Finn while BB-8 shocked him with one of his tools. Finn was finally explained that he had met and helped Dameron escape the ''[[Finalizer]]'', but that Dameron had apparently perished during their crash, to BB-8's distress. Finn also claimed to be with the Resistance.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Just then, two stormtroopers noticed BB-8 and called in an airstrike. As two [[TIE/fo space superiority fighter|TIE fighters]] began firing at them, the three fugitives managed to board the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. BB-8 hung on for the bumpy ride as Rey piloted the ship through the Graveyard until Finn could shoot the TIE fighters chasing them. Home free, the ''Falcon'' flew into space, leaving Jakku behind.<ref name="Episode VII" />

====Journey to the Base====
{{Quote|You're ok. He's with the Resistance. He's going to get you home. We both will.|Rey to BB-8|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}
[[File:Finn Asks BB8 for the Resistance Base Location.png|left|thumb|300px|Finn asks BB-8 for the Resistance base location.]]
While in the Jakku system, Rey had to repair the ''Falcon'', and asked Finn where the Resistance base was. Not knowing the answer, he admitted to BB-8 (but not to Rey) that he wasn't part of the Resistance and asked where the base was. After some consideration, BB-8 revealed the base's location in the [[Ileenium system]]. Just then, the ''Falcon'' was caught in a tractor beam and captured by a larger ship.<ref name="Episode VII" />

====Aboard the Eravana====
{{Quote|Get below deck and stay there until I say so -- don't even think about taking the Falcon.''"<br />"''What about BB-8?''"<br />"''He stays with me -- until I get rid of the gang, then you can have him back and be on your way.|Han Solo to Rey|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}
Believing themselves to have been captured by the First Order, the three hid in a compartment, preparing to release gas to neutralize any boarding stormtroopers. Instead, they encountered [[Han Solo]] and [[Chewbacca]], the ''Falcon''’s former owners. Rey and Finn recognized Solo and Finn told him about BB-8's map, with the droid displaying the fragmented map in a [[hologram]].<ref name="Episode VII" />

However, Solo and Chewbacca's current freighter, the ''[[Eravana]]'', was boarded by members of the [[Guavian Death Gang]] and [[Kanjiklub]]. While Rey and Finn hid, BB-8 remained with the famed [[smuggler]]s as insurance, but this resulted in Guavian member [[Bala-Tik]] recognizing BB-8 and demanding Solo hand the droid over. But as Rey accidentally released the ''Eravana's'' cargo (three [[rathtar]]s) and a [[Skirmish aboard the Eravana|firefight]] began, BB-8 fled with Solo and Chewbacca to the ''Millennium Falcon'', where they met with Finn and Rey and escaped.<ref name="Episode VII" />

====Takodana====
{{Quote|No, you can't. You have to go back. You're important. Much more so than I am. They'll help you to fulfill your mission, more than I ever could. I'm sorry|Rey to BB-8|Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)}}
Solo took Finn, Rey, and BB-8 to meet his old friend [[Maz Kanata]] at [[Maz Kanata's castle|her castle]] on the planet [[Takodana]]. There, spies for both the Resistance and the First Order recognized the droid and alerted their organizations. BB-8 followed Rey into a basement room, where she found the [[Skywalker's lightsaber|lightsaber]] that had belonged to Luke Skywalker and his father [[Anakin Skywalker|Anakin]] before him. Upon touching it, she received a [[Force vision|vision]], which frightened her and caused her to run off into the woods.<ref name="Episode VII" />

BB-8 followed Rey until she stopped.<ref name="Episode VII" /> He then asked her where they would go next. BB-8 had decided to stay with Rey permanently, despite her instances that he couldn't, being too important and being able to get help from the others in completing his mission.<ref name="TFA Junior Novel" /> When they saw First Order ships streaking through the sky, they returned to find the castle under attack. Spotted by stormtroopers, Rey told BB-8 to go further into the woods, while she drew them away. When the battle was over, Rey had been captured by [[Kylo Ren]]. While a Resistance counter-attack forced the First Order to retreat, but with Rey having seen the map, Ren decided that they could get it out of her and would no longer need BB-8.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Solo, Chewbacca, Finn, and BB-8 were brought to the Resistance base on D'Qar by General Leia Organa. There, BB-8 eagerly was reunited with Poe, who had managed to survive the crash on Jakku. BB-8 also removed the cover off of [[R2-D2]], hoping to get a response, but C-3PO explained that Artoo had been in low power mode since Master Luke had gone into exile. BB-8 wondered if Artoo had the rest of the map in his backup memory, to which Threepio replied that it was unlikely.<ref name="Episode VII" />

====Battle of Starkiller Base====
[[File:Poe blowing up Starkiller Base.png|right|thumb|256x256px|BB-8 accompanied Poe Dameron during the Battle of Starkiller Base, in which Dameron destroyed the planet-weapon.]]
BB-8 accompanied Poe Dameron during the [[Battle of Starkiller Base]], navigating for Poe in his custom X-Wing ''[[Black One]]''. The X-wings would attack the base's [[thermal oscillator]] after the shields had been disabled by Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Finn, which could cause the charged weapon to become unstable and self-destruct. BB-8 flew with Dameron as he led the X-Wings on an initial attack on the oscillator, but it failed to do significant damage. After the first attack run, General [[Armitage Hux]] of the First Order ordered all TIE squadrons to attack. During the battle, over half of the Resistance's attack force was destroyed, and the X-Wings failed to do any significant damage to the thermal oscillator. However, Chewbacca detonated several explosives along the oscillator, providing Dameron with an opening. With less than a minute to spare, Poe and BB-8 flew down a trench to the regulator, squeezing through a very narrow opening into the regulator itself, where Poe fired several [[proton torpedo]]es into the infrastructure. The damage was enough to destroy the regulator, destabilizing the planet-weapon's core, ripping apart the surface and destroying the planet.<ref name="Episode VII" />

After the battle, the X-Wings returned to D'Qar, along with the ''Millennium Falcon'' carrying Chewbacca, Finn, and Rey, with Han Solo having been killed during the mission. Upon Rey's arrival, R2-D2 woke up from his low-power state. He revealed the map to Luke's location, with only one piece missing. BB-8 then projected its piece, fitting it into the hole in Artoo's map and revealing Luke's location: [[Ahch-To]].<ref name="Episode VII" /> Shortly before Rey's departure from D'Qar, BB-8 recorded Rey saying goodbye to Finn, who was in a [[coma]], and that she would see him again before kissing him on the forehead.<ref name="TLJ Junior novel">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: A Junior Novel]]''</ref> With the location discovered at last, BB-8 and the others bid farewell to Rey, Chewbacca, and Artoo as they set off to find the fabled [[Jedi]].<ref name="Episode VII" />

====Evacuation of D'Qar====
{{Quote|I've got a bad feeling about this!''"<br />"''Happy beeps here, Buddy! Come on!|BB-8 and Poe|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}
Shortly after returning from Starkiller Base, BB-8 was called into service with Dameron again when the First Order launched an [[Evacuation of D'Qar|attack]] against the Resistance Base on D'Qar. Facing down three [[Resurgent-class Star Destroyer|''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyers]] and [[Fulminatrix|one]] [[Mandator IV-class Siege Dreadnought|''Mandator IV''-class Siege Dreadnought]] in the astromech slot of ''Black One'',<ref name="Episode VIII">[[Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VIII ''The Last Jedi'']]</ref> BB-8 remarked that he had a bad feeling about it,<ref name="The Last Jedi bad feeling">{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rian-johnson-last-jedi-star-wars-easter-egg_us_5a343517e4b01d429cc8bd59|title='Last Jedi' Director Explains How He Hid A Classic 'Star Wars' Easter Egg|first=Bill|last=Bradley|work=HuffPost|date=December 16, 2017|accessdate=December 16, 2017}}</ref> while Poe urged him to remain positive.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

In order to stall for time, BB-8 patched Poe through to Hux on board the ''Finalizer'', and activated the X-Wing's sub-light boosters, blasting the ship towards the dreadnought at high speed. When ''Black One's'' weapons systems went offline, preventing Poe from clearing out the dreadnought's surface cannons, BB-8 repaired the weapons systems by ramming his head into the faulty wiring, causing the droid to be briefly shocked.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

After the attack on the ''Fulminatrix ''succeeded, Poe and BB-8 returned to the Resistance [[flagship]] ''[[Raddus (MC85 Star Cruiser)|Raddus]]'', and BB-8 informed Poe that Finn was awake and wandering the halls of the ''Raddus''. BB-8 was present on the ''Raddus''<nowiki/>' bridge when the First Order fleet, led by the ''[[Supremacy]]'', caught up with the Resistance fleet after tracking them through hyperspace.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

BB-8 went ahead of Poe to prepare ''Black One ''to engage the fleet again, but Kylo Ren launched a pair of [[Magnetic pulse/Canon|mag-pulse warheads]] from [[Kylo Ren's TIE silencer|his]] [[TIE/vn space superiority fighter|TIE Silencer]] that destroyed ''Black One'' and the entire hangar bay. The blast knocked BB-8's head off of his body, but the droid managed to put himself back together.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

====Mission to Canto Bight====
BB-8 [[Mission to Canto Bight|accompanied]] Finn and Resistance maintenance worker [[Rose Tico]] in their mission to disable the First Order's hyperspace tracker. To do this, Finn and Rose planned to enlist the help of a [[Master Codebreaker]] on [[Cantonica]] who could get them onto the ''Supremacy''.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

At the [[Canto Bight]] [[Canto Casino|Casino]], the drunkard [[Dobbu Scay]] mistook BB-8 for a [[lugjack]] [[slot machine]], and put several [[cantocoin]]s into the droid's ports. When Finn and Rose were arrested for parking their shuttle illegally, [[Canto Bight Police Department|Canto Bight police]] officers threw BB-8 out of the casino. BB-8 made his way to the [[Canto Bight police headquarters]] and located Finn and Rose's cell.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

When the thief "[[DJ]]" opened every cell door in the facility, BB-8 managed to bind and gag several CBPD officers in the ensuing chaos. BB-8 soon met up with DJ. The two were confronted by prison guards, but BB-8 took one down by launching the cantocoins Scay had put inside him at the guard. When DJ attempted to collect the coins, BB-8 stopped him, and the two obtained the yacht ''Libertine'', and used it to pick up Finn and Rose. BB-8 would claim that DJ stole the vessel, but DJ insisted that both of them were responsible for it.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

====Infiltrating the ''Supremacy''====
BB-8 joined Finn, Rose, and DJ aboard the ''Supremacy'' in the final stages of their mission. To disguise the droid, Finn placed a garbage receptacle on top of him. Though BB-8 attempted to blend in by imitating the noises made by MSE-6 series repair droids, the First Order BB-unit [[BB-9E]] saw through the rebels' subterfuge, and alerted the First Order to their presence. Finn, Rose, and DJ were apprehended, but BB-8 avoided capture.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

When [[Vice Admiral]] [[Amilyn Holdo]] sacrificed herself to save the Resistance, using the ''Raddus'' to ram the ''Supremacy'' at light speed, BB-8 took advantage of the confusion in the ''Supremacy ''hangar bay by hijacking an [[First Order All Terrain Scout Transport|AT-ST]] walker and shooting many stormtroopers. BB-8 then used the walker to carry Finn and Rose to a [[Xi-class light shuttle|''Xi''-class light shuttle]] that they used to join the remnant of the Resistance on the surface of [[Crait]].<ref name="Episode VIII" />

====Crait and beyond====
After their shuttle crashed in the decommissioned [[Crait outpost|Rebel outpost]] on Crait, BB-8 shared a loving reunion with Poe. BB-8 performed an analysis of the outpost and learned that, save small natural openings, the only way in and out of the outpost was through the massive bunker door: an entrance now cut off by the advancing First Order.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

However, BB-8, along with the rest of the Resistance followed Poe when he realized that the [[Vulptex|vulptices]] must have found an alternate way out of the base. They came to a wall of boulders too heavy to move by hand. BB-8 then witnessed as Rey, on the other side of the wall, used [[the Force]] to lift the boulders out of the way, allowing the Resistance to escape on the ''Falcon ''and survive another day.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

On board the ''Falcon'', BB-8 reunited with Rey, who told him that his antenna looked good.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

==Characteristics==
{{Quote|You're a true friend.|Rey|Forces of Destiny: Daring Adventures: Volume 1}}
[[File:BB-8 TFACS.png|left|thumb|250px|BB-8 alongside a T-70 X-wing]]
A BB-series, BB-8 had a dome head, similar to that of [[R2 series astromech droid]]s, with the bulk of its body made up of a dense, well-sealed ball on which the droid's head rolled.<ref name="TFA VD" /> BB-8 was mostly [[Color|white]], with some orange and silver on its body, as well as a black [[photoreceptor]].<ref name="Episode VII" />

Though BB-8's self-preservation protocols meant the droid was skittish and easily frightened, its experiences formed a strong loyalty subprogram.<ref name="TFA VD" /> BB-8's manifest personality was, to his master and friend Poe Dameron, somewhat of an unpredictable one: while most droids were predictable to certain stereotypes (bossy, sullen, grumpy) within their respective programming, BB-8 was his own case, sometimes childlike, sometimes precocious. In fact, Dameron sometimes wondered if the droid daydreamed, even though that implied the absurd—that BB-8 had an active imagination.<ref name="BTA" /> When communicating, BB-8 spoke in [[27th generation droidspeak]] code, a compressed version of [[binary]].<ref name="TFA VD" />

BB-8 was loyal to his master Poe, who regarded him as a confidant.<ref name="Poe Dameron 4" /> When Poe could not trust the rest of his squadron, he turned to BB-8 as a "sounding board."<ref name="Poe Dameron 8" /> BB-8 knew how to operate a T-70 X-wing and was familiar with the model's design and accessories.<ref name="PD 1" /> BB-8 also knew how to fight. On two occasions, he helped Poe outsmart and disarm the First Order Agent Terex.<ref name="Poe Dameron 3" /> BB-8 also played a supporting role in Poe's operations.<ref name="Poe Dameron 5" /> On one occasion, he led the other astromech droids on a successful operation to disable Megalox Beta's gravity shields. BB-8 also outwitted and defeated a security droid during the course of the Megalox mission.<ref name="Poe Dameron 6" />

BB-8 was courageous and daring enough to put his existence on the line to aid his Resistance comrades. On one occasion, he used a cable to hang on to the top of a cave while he collapsed a stalactite on top of Agent Terex's Ranc gang. While BB-8 was shot down,<ref name="Poe Dameron 12" /> he survived the fall and electrocuted Terex, saving Poe's life a third time.<ref name="Poe Dameron 13" />

==Equipment==
{{Quote|He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator...|Rey, to Kylo Ren|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}
[[File:BB-8thumbsup.png|right|thumb|220px|BB-8 doing a thumbs-up with his lighter.]]
All of BB-8's equipment was stored within six swappable, circular [[tool-bay disk]]s embedded in the ball, that could be replaced or upgraded with minimal reprogramming.<ref name="TFA VD" /> Being an astromech droid, BB-8 had several features such as an [[arc welder]],<ref name="Episode VII" /> a [[welding torch]].<ref name="TFAn" /> and a [[holoprojector]].<ref name="Episode VII" /> Like all BB units, he had a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator. His white-and-orange paint scheme was described by his master as being a "one-of-a-kind" design for his model.<ref name="Episode VII" />

==Behind the scenes==
{{Quote|They never cease to amaze me with what they’re able to come up with, you know? I said, 'How are you ever gonna top R2-D2, the most adorable droid in movie history?'|[[Mark Hamill]] on BB-8|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/mark-hamill-on-playing-with-the-star-wars-the-105015597302.html}}
[[File:BB-8 concept art.png|left|150px|thumb|"Napkin sketch" of BB-8.]]
BB-8 was first revealed in the first teaser trailer for [[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']] on [[November 28]], [[2014]].<ref name="Teaser Trailer">{{SW|url=films/star-wars-episode-vii-the-force-awakens|text=''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens''}}</ref> Its name was revealed by [http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/12/11/star-wars-the-force-awakens-character-names/ ''Entertainment Weekly''] in an exclusive trading card.<ref name="Name Revealed">{{Cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/12/11/star-wars-the-force-awakens-character-names/|title='Star Wars: The Force Awakens' character names revealed (in coolest way possible) -- exclusive|first=Anthony|last=Breznican|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=December 11, 2014|accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref> The character was realized by the [[Wikipedia:Pinewood Studios|Pinewood Studios]] creature shop as a practical, functioning robot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/mark-hamill-on-playing-with-the-star-wars-the-105015597302.html|title=Mark Hamill on Playing With the 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' Ball Droid and Singing for 'Elf'|publisher=yahoo.com|last=Watkins|first=Gwynne|date=December 12, 2014|accessdate=December 19, 2014}}</ref>

BB-8's name was chosen by Episode VII director [[J.J. Abrams]] because of the droid's round and bouncy look. Abrams also said, "I named him BB-8 because it was almost onomatopoeia. It was sort of how he looked to me, with the 8, obviously, and then the two B's." The name was conceived early in Episode VII's production and was one of the few that was never changed.<ref name="Name Confirmations">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/08/12/star-wars-force-awakens-character-names/4|title=''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'': J.J.

BB-8 is performed by [[Dave Chapman]] and [[Brian Herring]]. BB-8's voice includes digitally altered sounds created by actors [[Bill Hader]] and [[Ben Schwartz]], who are credited as "BB-8 Vocal Consultants."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2015/12/18/bb_8_vocal_consultant_ben_schwartz_on_voicing_the_force_awakens_droid.html|title=BB-8 “Vocal Consultant” Ben Schwartz on Getting Into Character and BB-8’s Gender|work=Slate|first=Forrest|last=Wickman|date=2015-12-18|accessdate=2015-12-20}}</ref> The vocalizations were produced in post-production, with the crew deciding between beeps and voice.<ref name="Commentary">Director [[J.J.

Seven different BB-8 units were used in the making of Episode VII.
