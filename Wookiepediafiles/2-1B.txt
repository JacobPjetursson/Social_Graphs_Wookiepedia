'''2-1B''' was a [[2-1B surgical droid]] that was a member of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. Along with [[FX-7 medical assistant droid|FX-7]], 2-1B was stationed at [[Echo Base]] on [[Hoth]] and treated [[Luke Skywalker]] with [[bacta]] after [[Sexes|he]] had been attacked by a [[wampa]]. 2-1B also treated Skywalker after his hand was [[Dismemberment|amputated]] in a [[Duel on Cloud City|duel]] with [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] on [[Bespin]].<ref name="ESB" />

2-1B had long experience with [[human]]s since the times of the [[Galactic Republic|Old Republic]], giving him a caring bedside manner. It was thanks to this that Skywalker specifically requested 2-1B's treatment following the loss of his hand. He was also able to perform extremely precise operations that left little to no scar on his patients.<ref name="charencupdated" />
