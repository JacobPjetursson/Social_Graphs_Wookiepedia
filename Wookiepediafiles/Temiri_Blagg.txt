'''Temiri Blagg''', a [[Force-sensitive]]<ref name="Episode VIII" /> [[human]] [[Sexes|male]], was a [[Youngling|child]] who lived a forlorn existence<ref name="Temiri Blagg DB" /> working as a stable hand in the [[Canto Casino]]<ref name="TLJ VD">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> during the [[First Order–Resistance war]].<ref name="Episode VIII" /> He was part of a team of urchins&mdash;children abandoned on the [[planet]] [[Cantonica]] as a result of gambling losses&mdash;who oversaw the racing [[fathier]]s of [[Canto Bight]] under the management of [[Bargwill Tomder]].<ref name="TLJ VD" /> In [[34 ABY]],<ref name="Date">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]'' places the events of the film [[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']] in [[34 ABY]]. As [[Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VIII ''The Last Jedi'']] carries on immediately from the events of ''The Force Awakens'', it can be assumed to take place in the same [[Standard year|year]].</ref> he briefly encountered the [[Resistance]] operatives [[Rose Tico]] and [[Finn]], who were attempting to evade the [[Police officer|officers]] of the [[Canto Bight Police Department]]. Finn and Tico ultimately escaped Canto Bight with the help of Blagg and his fellow urchins, who released the fathiers from the stables, resulting in the [[Species|animals]] stampeding through the [[city]] and escaping into the [[desert]].<ref name="Episode VIII" />

Following the [[Battle of Crait]], Blagg and the other stable hands listened as another urchin, [[Oniho Zaya]], regaled them with tales of [[Jedi Master]] [[Luke Skywalker]] and how he stood alone against the [[First Order]] on [[Crait]]. He resumed his duties shortly afterward, sweeping the floor of the stables. By then he concealed a [[Rose Tico's Resistance ring|Resistance ring]],<ref name="Episode VIII" /> a [[Galactic Civil War]]-era antique formerly owned by Tico.<ref name="TLJ VD" /> While staring at the [[star]]s, Blagg&mdash;who dreamed of a better life away from Canto Bight&mdash;[[Telekinesis|telekinetically]] lifted his broom with the [[Force power|power]] of [[the Force]].<ref name="Episode VIII" />
