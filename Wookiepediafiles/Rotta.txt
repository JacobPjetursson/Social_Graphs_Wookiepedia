'''Rotta''', nicknamed "'''Pedunkee Mufkin'''", translated as Punky Muffin, by his father and he was also nicknamed "'''Stinky'''" by [[Ahsoka Tano]], was a [[Sexes|male]] [[Hutt]] and the son of [[Jabba Desilijic Tiure|Jabba the Hutt]]. During the [[Clone Wars]], he was secretly kidnapped by the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]], which was orchestrated by Count Dooku with help from [[Ziro Desilijic Tiure/Canon|Ziro]], Rotta's great-uncle. The plot was meant to discredit the [[Jedi Order]] and scuttle negotiations between the [[Galactic Republic]] and the Hutts, but the Jedi were able to rescue him.<ref name="TCWFilm" />
