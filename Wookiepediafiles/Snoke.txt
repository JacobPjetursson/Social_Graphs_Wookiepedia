{{Quote|Darkness rises and light to meet it.|Snoke|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}
'''Snoke''', a [[Force-sensitive]] [[humanoid]] [[alien]] [[Sexes|male]], was the [[Supreme Leader]] of the [[First Order]] and a powerful practitioner of the [[dark side of the Force]]. Although he practiced the ways of the dark side, Snoke was not a [[Sith]]; that order perished with the [[death]]s of the last two [[Sith Lord]]s, [[Darth Sidious]] and [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]]. Like the Sith, Snoke sought to achieve the complete [[Jedi Purge|destruction]] of the [[Jedi Order]], which he saw as a symbol of hope that could thwart his plans of [[Galaxy|galactic]] conquest. To that end, he successfully turned the young but powerful [[Kylo Ren|Ben Solo]] to the dark side. Solo, who had once [[Jedi training|trained]] in the ways of the [[light side of the Force]] as part of a new generation of [[Jedi]], [[Destruction of Luke Skywalker's Jedi Temple|renounced]] his ties to the Jedi Order and his [[Skywalker (family)|family]] in favor of becoming Kylo Ren&mdash;master of the [[Knights of Ren]] and apprentice to the Supreme Leader. With Ren under his command, Snoke set his new acolyte to task by dispatching him to hunt and kill [[Jedi Master]] [[Luke Skywalker]], the uncle and former mentor of Ben Solo.

During the waning [[Standard day|days]] of the [[cold war]], as Ren led the hunt for the [[map to Skywalker]], [[General]] [[Armitage Hux]] informed Snoke that the [[Starkiller Base|Starkiller]] [[superweapon]] was complete and thereby proposed to test its destructive firepower on the [[New Republic]] [[capital]] [[Planet|world]] of [[Hosnian Prime]]. Snoke approved the general's plan, resulting in the [[Hosnian Cataclysm|annihilation]] of the entire [[Hosnian system]], the [[Galactic Senate (New Republic)|Galactic Senate]], and a substantial portion of the [[New Republic Defense Fleet]]. With the Republic in disarray, Snoke turned his attention to the [[Resistance]]&mdash;a [[Resistance military|paramilitary]] group led by Ren's [[Parent|mother]], General [[Leia Organa]]&mdash;and ordered Hux to use the weapon on [[D'Qar]] where the [[Resistance base]] was located. However, Starkiller Base was [[Battle of Starkiller Base|destroyed]] in a Resistance raid and Ren was defeated by [[Rey]], a [[The Force|Force]]-sensitive [[scavenger]] from [[Jakku]].

Despite the loss of the superweapon, Snoke deployed the [[First Order military|armed forces]] of the First Order across [[the galaxy]] with the intention of seizing control of the major [[star system]]s. At the same [[time]], he personally oversaw the First Order's efforts to [[First Order–Resistance war|destroy the Resistance]]. Using his [[Flagship|mobile headquarters]], the [[Mega-class Star Dreadnought|''Mega''-class Star Dreadnought]] ''[[Supremacy]]'', as a [[command ship]], the Supreme Leader's [[Fleet|armada]] [[Attack on the Resistance fleet|pursued]] the [[Resistance navy|Resistance fleet]] from D'Qar to the [[Crait system]]. He also began to reconsider his view on Ren, whom he now regarded as a failed apprentice and unworthy of Vader's legacy. Believing Ren was not strong enough to hide his conflicted [[heart]], Snoke used his powers to bridge the [[Brain|minds]] of Ren and Rey, who [[Force-bond|bonded]] with each other through the Force, as a way to lure the [[Padawan|aspiring Jedi]] into a trap. Rey ultimately took the bait, convinced that she could redeem Ren, and was [[torture]]d by Snoke who succeeded in [[Mind probe (Force power)|probing]] her mind for Skywalker's [[Ahch-To|place]] of [[Exile (punishment)|exile]]. Having gained the knowledge he sought, Snoke ordered Ren to execute Rey. Yet as he concentrated on Ren's thoughts, the Supreme Leader did not sense his apprentice's impending [[Treason|betrayal]] in the form of the [[Skywalker's lightsaber|Skywalker lightsaber]], which Ren used to [[assassin]]ate his master. The dark warrior then claimed the mantle of Supreme Leader for himself and implicated Rey&mdash;who rejected Ren's offer to rule the galaxy together&mdash;as the one responsible for Snoke's death.

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Quote|It is where you are from. What you are made of. The dark side—and the light. The finest sculptor cannot fashion a masterpiece from poor materials. He must have something pure, something strong, something unbreakable, with which to work.|Snoke, to Kylo Ren|Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)}}
[[File:Snoke throne room.png|thumb|left|300px|Snoke was the Supreme Leader of the First Order, a hermit state determined to recapture the legacy and glory of the Galactic Empire.]]
Snoke was a [[humanoid]] [[alien]] who was a master of the [[dark side of the Force]]. At some unspecified point in [[Sexes|his]] life, Snoke acquired a black [[obsidian]] [[stone]] from the catacombs and [[mine]]s beneath the [[Fortress Vader|castle]] of the [[Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] on the [[planet]] [[Mustafar]]. He affixed the stone to a [[gold]]en [[Snoke's ring|ring]] he wore, which was engraved with glyphs used by the [[Four Sages of Dwartii]],<ref name="TLJ:TVD">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: The Visual Dictionary]]''</ref> controversial figures of philosophy from the early [[Standard day|days]] of the [[Galactic Republic]] that were represented with [[bronzium]] statues in the [[Emperor's office|office]] of [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]].<ref name="Complete Locations">''[[Star Wars: Complete Locations (2016)|Star Wars: Complete Locations]]''</ref>

Although he was a very powerful practitioner of the dark side of [[the Force]], Snoke was not affiliated with the [[Sith]], which became extinct as a result of the [[death]]s of Darth Sidious and Darth Vader aboard the [[Death Star II]] during the [[Battle of Endor]] thanks to the efforts of the [[Jedi Knight]] [[Luke Skywalker]]. As such, Snoke, a secretive master of the Force, was a seeker of arcane and ancient lore.<ref name="TLJ:TVD" /><ref name="Sith Databank">{{Databank|sith|Sith}}</ref><ref name="Snoke DB" /> He had also been sensed by Sidious shortly before the latter's death, and had also been familiar with Skywalker.<ref name="Expanded Edition">''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi: Expanded Edition]]''</ref>

Eventually, Snoke witnessed the [[Proclamation of the New Order|rise]] and [[Battle of Jakku|fall]] of the [[Galactic Empire]].<ref name="VIInovel" /> Through a secret [[Contingency]], however, many former [[Imperial officer]]s, [[noble]]s and technologists fled to the [[Unknown Regions]] of [[the galaxy]]. Most of the former Imperial officers would have likely perished while crossing this uncharted realm if it had not been for the ancient hyperspace trails blazed by a retinue of mute alien navigators that served Snoke, the [[Attendants]], along with some knowledge of the Unknown Regions provided by the [[Chiss]] [[Grand Admiral]] [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo|Thrawn]],<ref name="EE">''[[Aftermath: Empire's End]]''</ref> which helped the former Imperial officers settle there and reorganize themselves into the [[First Order]].<ref name="FO Databank">{{Databank|the-first-order|The First Order}}</ref><ref name="TLJ:TVD" /> In a matter of time, Snoke unexpectedly became the [[Supreme Leader]] of the First Order. The last of the Imperial leadership, including Grand [[Admiral]] [[Rae Sloane]], the political lunatic [[Ormes Apolin]], and even [[General]] [[Brendol Hux]] did not expect Snoke's rise to power and were surprised when it occurred. General [[Armitage Hux]], Brendol's son, was spared by Snoke in order to use him as a tool in his rise to power.<ref name="Expanded Edition" />

===Seduction of Kylo Ren===
{{Quote|No. It was Snoke.''"<br />"''Snoke?''"<br />"''He knew our child would be strong with the Force. That he was born with equal potential for good or evil.|Leia Organa and Han Solo|Star Wars: The Force Awakens (novelization)}}
[[File:Episode VIII Snoke and Kylo Ren.png|thumb|right|300px|Fascinated by the Skywalker bloodline, Snoke saw the potential for limitless power in Ben Solo.]]
Snoke became invested in the [[Skywalker (family)|Skywalker]] [[blood]]line, believing General [[Leia Organa]] and [[Han Solo]]'s son, [[Kylo Ren|Ben Solo]], the grandson of [[Anakin Skywalker|Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader]] and the nephew of the now [[Jedi Master]] [[Luke Skywalker]], had the right balance of the [[Light side of the Force|light]] and dark sides of the Force in him.<ref name="VIInovel" /> In addition, Snoke had been indirectly responsible for convincing Skywalker to rebuild the Jedi Order in an attempt to break the latter when he had it destroyed alongside Skywalker himself, with his intending to corrupt Ben Solo being instrumental to these plans.<ref name="Expanded Edition" />

Leia was aware of the influence Snoke could have on her son, but did not inform Han, believing he would not understand and that, as a [[Force-sensitive]], it was her responsibility to keep Ben away from the dark side.<ref name="VIInovel" /> Eventually, Snoke had successfully turned Ben to the dark side, anointing him Kylo Ren, [[Master of the Knights of Ren|Master]] of the [[Knights of Ren]], and ordered him to [[Destruction of Luke Skywalker's Jedi Temple|destroy]] Skywalker's revived [[Jedi Order]]. Though Ren succeeded in slaughtering the entirety of the fledgling [[Jedi]] Order, Skywalker managed to escape into hiding to [[Ahch-To]],<ref name="Episode VII" /> as he felt that it wasn't Snoke, as Leia thought, but himself who was to take blame for the events due to his nearly killing Solo in his sleep after sensing the Dark side in him.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

===Cold war===
====Map to Skywalker====
{{Quote|Even ''you,'' master of the Knights of Ren, have never faced such a test.''"<br />"''By the grace of your training, I will not be seduced.|Snoke and Kylo Ren|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}
[[File:Kylo Ren and Snoke.png|thumb|left|300px|Anticipating a confrontation between Kylo Ren and Han Solo, Snoke warned his apprentice that he would soon face his greatest test yet.]]
Following Skywalker's disappearance, Snoke assigned Ren to hunt down the last Jedi, knowing that as long as Skywalker lived, the Jedi and thus hope lived. In [[34 ABY]],<ref name="Galactic Atlas">''[[Star Wars: Galactic Atlas]]''</ref> Ren's search [[Attack on Tuanul|led]] him to [[Jakku]], where he learned that the final piece of the map to Skywalker was in the possession of the [[astromech droid]] [[BB-8]]. Snoke ordered the [[droid]]'s capture or destruction, preferably the former. Despite the efforts of the First Order, BB-8 managed to [[Escape from Jakku|escape]] Jakku aboard the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Ren and General Hux later returned to [[Starkiller Base]] to communicate with Snoke via [[hologram]]. Hux proposed using Starkiller Base's [[superweapon]] to destroy the [[New Republic]] [[Galactic Senate (New Republic)|government]], which was backing the [[Resistance]], an undertaking which Snoke authorized. He then spoke with Ren privately, asking if he had felt an awakening in the Force. He ordered Ren to kill his father to overcome his temptation by the light.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Shortly after the [[Hosnian Cataclysm|destruction]] of the [[Hosnian system]], resulting in the eradication of the New Republic government and a portion of its [[New Republic Defense Fleet|fleet]], Ren [[Battle of Takodana|invaded]] [[Takodana]] in search of BB-8. He later deemed the droid unnecessary as he captured a [[scavenger]] named [[Rey]], who had seen the final piece of the map to Skywalker's location. Snoke was later upset to hear that the girl resisted Ren's [[Mind probe (Force power)|interrogation]]. Ren defended himself by explaining that Rey was strong in the Force, albeit untrained. As the [[Resistance base]] had been discovered, Snoke ordered Hux to destroy the Resistance before they could find Skywalker, and for Ren to bring Rey to him. However, Ren never got the chance, as Rey managed to escape with the help of her new powers.<ref name="Episode VII" />

[[File:Hux Tells Snoke Starkiller Base is Finished.png|thumb|right|300px|The loss of Starkiller Base compelled Snoke to recall Hux and Ren, deciding the time had come to finish his apprentice's training.]]
Subsequently, Starkiller Base was infiltrated by Han Solo, [[Chewbacca]], and [[Finn]], who managed to lower the shields through the aid of a captured [[Captain]] [[Phasma]] to allow the [[Resistance navy|Resistance fleet]] to [[Battle of Starkiller Base|attack]] the base. Solo then tried to bring Ren back to the light, only for his own son to murder him. In rage and grief, Chewbacca wounded Ren and blew a hole in the superweapon's [[thermal oscillator]], allowing [[Resistance pilot]] [[Poe Dameron]] to fly in and destroy it, causing catastrophic damage, preventing the solar energy from being contained. When the destruction of Starkiller Base was inevitable, a frantic Hux reported this to Snoke who was remarkably blase about it, instead ordering the general to bring Ren to him in order to complete his training.<ref name="Episode VII" />

Eventually, in spite of the loss of Starkiller Base, the First Order managed to gain enough victories in the conflict that Snoke decided to risk coming out of the shadows to personally lead the First Order to potential dominance over the Resistance.<ref name="Sphero">[[BB-9E]] on the ''[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sphero.starwars Star Wars App-Enabled Droids by Sphero]'' {{C|Screenshots: [[:File:Supreme Leader Snoke data.png|1]]}}</ref>

===Fall from power===
{{Quote|You think you can turn him? Pathetic child. I cannot be betrayed; I cannot be beaten. I see his mind; I see his every intent. Yes... I see him turning the lightsaber to strike true! And now, foolish child, he ignites it and ''kills'' his true enemy!|Snoke's last words, said to Rey|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}
[[File:Supreme Leader Snoke TLJ.png|thumb|left|300px|The Supreme Leader, who did not foresee his impending doom, watched with anticipation as Ren outwardly prepared to execute Rey.]]
Sometime after the destruction of Starkiller Base, Snoke began directing several maneuvers designed to eliminate any possibility of hope returning to the galaxy. He empowered General Hux to pursue and destroy the Resistance fleet, which initially failed when an assault on their base not only saw the Resistance slip away but the loss of a First Order dreadnought. Snoke immediately contacted Hux to make his anger clear, using the Force to painfully humiliate the general, but was delighted when Hux revealed a way to track the fleet's movements through [[hyperspace]], thereby allowing the First Order to immediately pinpoint their location.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

Immediately after his audience with Hux, Snoke turned his attention to his disgraced apprentice, remarking on how he had begun to lose faith in his apprentice after his failure at Starkiller Base and his further conflict over having murdered his father,<ref name="Episode VIII" /> having felt from afar Ren's struggle when he killed his father.<ref name="TLJA1">''[[The Last Jedi Adaptation 1]]''</ref> Snoke's taunts caused Ren to attempt to attack him, causing the Supreme Leader's guards to react aggressively, but Snoke effortlessly brushed aside the attack with a bolt of Force lightning and went back to his throne, reminding Ren that as long as the Jedi persisted in the galaxy, so too did the hope that could defeat them. He then chastised Ren out of the throne room by saying him that he was just a child with a [[Kylo Ren's helmet|mask]] rather than the successor of Darth Vader.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

But once Ren left the throne room, Snoke smiled to himself. He must've used this reprimand as a way to motivate his apprentice. If that was the case,<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> then it worked: Ren destroyed his mask on the [[turbolift]] with all the pent-up rage he could muster before preparing for what appeared to be the First Order's [[Attack on the Resistance fleet|final victory]].<ref name="Episode VIII" /><ref name="Expanded Edition" />

Seeking to shift the tides in his favor, Snoke claimed to have used his own powers to link the minds of Rey and Ren through a [[Force-bond]]. For doing so, Snoke manipulated Ren's insecurity to his advantage, knowing his apprentice couldn't hide his conflict from Rey, who couldn't pass up the chance to redeem the former Ben Solo. Through the Force, both Rey and Ren could see each other and communicate from different locations in the galaxy. Believing she could restore Ben Solo to the light, Rey sought Ren out, and was brought to Snoke aboard the Supreme Leader's [[flagship]] known as the ''[[Supremacy]]'', where the Supreme Leader took her weapon, the legendary Skywalker lightsaber, and placed it next to him on the arm of his throne. Using his own formidable powers, Snoke restrained Rey and tortuously probed her mind to discover Skywalker's whereabouts.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

After obtaining the knowledge he sought, he contemptuously dropped the girl, only for her to attempt to summon Anakin Skywalker's [[Skywalker's lightsaber|weapon]] into her grasp, which he effortlessly redirected to strike her in the head from behind with a sneer. In one instance, after dropping Rey to the floor, Snoke laughed and mused that Skywalker had been "so wise" as to hide from him. He decided that once the Resistance was destroyed, he would command his forces to Ahch-To and obliterate the entire [[Temple island]] so Skywalker and the Jedi Order could be given the death he desired. As a final gesture of contempt, he forced Rey to watch the destruction of the Resistance's remaining ships via his [[Oculus (device)|oculus viewing scope]] operated and designed by the Attendants. Rather than breaking Rey's spirit, however, the sight prompted her to summon Kylo's sword to defy him once more, earning the Supreme Leader's respect as he sincerely complimented her for her courage.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

[[File:Death of the Supreme Leader.png|thumb|right|300px|Kylo Ren ignited his grandfather's lightsaber with the Force, ending the reign and life of Supreme Leader Snoke.]]
Acknowledging Rey now as a genuine threat to both himself and the First Order, Snoke commanded his apprentice to execute her, confident that Ren would not turn in spite of Rey's faith in his former persona, that of Ben Solo, and boasted that he could read his apprentice's mind and see his every thought and intention. Intending to torture the girl with every detail up to the moment of her death, he shut his eyes and described to Rey everything he saw in Ren's mind, turning the lightsaber to "strike true" and igniting it to kill his "true enemy."<ref name="Episode VIII" /> However, Snoke's visions and Force senses betrayed him.<ref name="Snoke DB" /> Once he reopened his eyes and awaited the coming strike, his triumphant smile became one of pained surprise as he felt the blade of a lightsaber piercing through his withered and twisted body. At the same time, his telekinetic hold over Rey collapsed. The Supreme Leader looked down to find the Skywalker lightsaber having been turned, aimed and activated in his direction. There was only one in this room who had the ability and cunning to pull off such a feat through the Force: Ren.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

Snoke tried to say something, but he couldn't.<ref name="TLJA5">''[[The Last Jedi Adaptation 5]]''</ref> He remained alive long enough to glare at his former apprentice for his betrayal before Ren summoned the still-active lightsaber to Rey's grasp and the blue blade cut through the Supreme Leader's waist and wrists, dismembering him. His upper torso then collapsed heavily to the floor at the base of his throne, leaving his hands on the armrests and his lower torso sitting on the throne.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

With Snoke dead, Ren proved himself to be a worthy successor of Darth Vader, as he achieved what his grandfather failed to do in the past and when he had the opportunity: overthrowing his master in the Sith way, the ancient [[Rule of Two]].<ref name="Episode VIII" />

===Legacy===
{{Quote|Our Supreme Leader is dead! We have no ruler&mdash;''"<br />"''The Supreme Leader is ''dead."<br />"''Long live the Supreme Leader&hellip;|Armitage Hux and Kylo Ren|Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi}}
[[File:Snoke Corpse.png|thumb|left|300px|With the death of Snoke, Kylo Ren completed his rise to power as the new Supreme Leader.]]
Immediately after his death, Snoke's [[bodyguard]]s attempted to avenge him, but despite their efforts, all of the [[Elite Praetorian Guard]] were killed by Kylo and Rey. After the Guards had all been killed, Ren stared at his Master's body, before offering Rey a place at his side. Rey begged him to help save the fleet and tried to pull her lightsaber back from him. The combined opposite pulls of Rey and Ren destroyed the blade, knocking Ren unconscious when he hit the floor while Rey was able to escape the doomed starship. Hux later entered to find Ren alone on the ground, and the body of the Supreme Leader. The lower half of Snoke's body then slipped off the throne and on to the floor beside the torso, right before Hux's eyes.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

Snoke's death created an immediate power vacuum that Ren took advantage of by assuming his fallen master's role as the new Supreme Leader of the First Order, much to the displeasure of Hux. Although Ren desired to rule the galaxy with Rey as his equal, the aspiring Jedi rejected his offer, leading Ren to falsely implicate her in the [[assassin]]ation of Snoke.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

By the time of the [[Battle of Grail City|battle]] of [[Grail City]], some [[First Order officer]]s, such as [[Colonel]] [[Barrut]] and her crew, weren't aware about Snoke's death and Ren's rise to power. When [[Wing Commander]] [[Poe Dameron]] informed them about Snoke's fate before destroying the ''[[Fortitude]]'', the [[Maxima-A class heavy cruiser]] which they commanded, two of Barrut's crewmen believed that Hux had taken Snoke's role as Supreme Leader only for Barrut to refuse believing Dameron's claims as they must have been lies.<ref name="Poe Dameron 31">''[[Poe Dameron 31: The Awakening, Part VI]]''</ref>

[[File:Snoke chillin like a villain.png|thumb|right|300px|Snoke's injuries caused him to prioritize comfort, such as the use of slippers, in order to endure the pain of his damaged body.]]
Supreme Leader Snoke was a secretive, enigmatic figure who coveted arcane lore. Rather than establish a permanent base of operations, he preferred governing the First Order in a mobile command post from where he could contact his subordinates,<ref name="Snoke DB" /> though his exact location was unknown.<ref name="TFA Graphic Novel">''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens Graphic Novel Adaptation]]''</ref> He was both wise<ref name="Episode VII" /> and cunning, having risen to power by undermining the First Order's leading officials through guile.<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> A master at manipulation, he lured Kylo Ren to the dark side of the Force by using the young Jedi's desperate need for a teacher to his advantage.<ref name="Snoke DB" /> Although he regarded Armitage Hux as a "rabid cur," Snoke recognized the general's usefulness and believed that even a person's weakness could serve a purpose if properly manipulated.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Despite holding a low opinion of Hux's character,<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> the Supreme Leader shared his underling's belief in the necessity of a powerful military force.<ref name="Snoke DB" /> In addition to overseeing a militarization program that violated treaties signed with the New Republic,<ref name="Snoke Bio Gallery">{{Databank|supreme-leader-snoke-biography-gallery|Supreme Leader Snoke Biography Gallery}}</ref> Snoke often sanctioned Hux's military strategies<ref name="Episode VII" /> and showed approval for his technological innovations.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

Snoke was fascinated with Ren,<ref name="Episode VIII" /> not only for his apprentice's inherent potential for limitless power<ref name="Kylo Ren Bio Gallery">{{Databank|kylo-ren-biography-gallery|Kylo Ren Biography Gallery}}</ref> but also because he regarded him as the embodiment of the dark side and the light.<ref name="TFA VD" /> Despite this, Snoke adhered to the dark side and viewed the light as the weak and pathetic side of the Force.<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> It was Ren's raw, untamed strength in the Force that led Snoke to believe his student could achieve a level of power comparable to that of Ren's late grandfather, the Sith [[Lord]] Darth Vader.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Disappointed by Ren's defeat on Starkiller Base, the Supreme Leader berated him as a failed apprentice&mdash;a child in a mask&mdash;who was unworthy of Vader's legacy.<ref name="Snoke Bio Gallery" /> In light of Ren's failure, Snoke began to doubt whether his disciple would ever overcome his conflict between the two sides of the Force. As such, he also began to consider the possibility of casting Ren aside for good,<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> just as Han Solo warned his son moments before his death.<ref name="Episode VII" /> Nevertheless, Snoke used his skills at manipulation to stoke Ren's conflicted soul, knowing that his apprentice would fail to hide his emotions from Rey after they became linked to each other through their Force-bond.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> It was through Ren that Snoke sought to manipulate Rey, convinced she would fall into his trap by believing that Ren could be turned from his dark path.<ref name="Expanded Edition" />

[[File:Snoke speaks to Kylo Ren and Hux.png|thumb|left|300px|Snoke used holographic theatrics to project a more imposing demeanor when communicating with his followers.]]
Like his apprentice, whose mask provided him with a more imposing presence,<ref name="Battlefront II">''[[Star Wars Battlefront II]]''</ref> Snoke relied on theatrics when interacting with his subordinates via holographic transmission. Although the Supreme Leader was, in reality, around seven feet tall,<ref name="People" /> his holographic form magnified his height several times over, allowing him to "look down" upon his followers.<ref name="Sphero" /> While he initially tolerated his apprentice's desire to emulate Vader by wearing a mask, Snoke thought it was absurd and later ridiculed Ren's affectation.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

Snoke's intelligent, sophisticated, and at times calm demeanor masked his more sinister qualities such as cruelty, arrogance, egotism, and narcissism. He was a terrifying, monstrous individual<ref name="Snoke's motives">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms9j25XkYoU Andy Serkis: Supreme Leader Snoke Is Motivated By Fear - CONAN on TBS]</ref> who possessed a dark nature that rivaled even that of the late Darth Sidious.<ref name="Empire Reveals New Look At Snoke From The Last Jedi">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jedinews.co.uk/film-music-tv/articles/empire-reveals-new-look-snoke-last-jedi/|title=Empire Reveals New Look At Snoke From 'The Last Jedi'|publisher=''Jedi News''|date=November 29, 2017|accessdate=November 29, 2017}}</ref> Snoke's demeanor shifted from calmness<ref name="Episode VII" /> to anger,<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> depending on the situation. Upon learning of Starkiller's impending destruction, he simply told Hux to evacuate the base with Ren,<ref name="Episode VII" /> only to later scold and physically reprimand his apprentice out of frustration.<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> When presented with the chance to use the Starkiller superweapon against the New Republic, Snoke agreed with Hux's plan to lure the First Order's enemies out of hiding in spite of ending billions of lives in the process.<ref name="Episode VII" />

[[File:Angry Snoke.png|thumb|right|300px|Snoke derided Ren as a failed apprentice who was no Darth Vader, merely a child hiding behind a mask.]]
Additionally, Snoke was a cruel master as well as a predator, who identified weakness and exploited it, as demonstrated by how Snoke dominated not just the First Order but specifically Ren and Hux, making him a brutal tyrant. He particularly enjoyed using his powers to penetrate the minds of his victims and subject them to agonizing scenes, picking apart their courage and resolve slowly over time.<ref name="Snoke's backstory">{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/11/22/star-wars-last-jedi-andy-serkis-snoke-backstory/|title=Andy Serkis says pain and greed drive Supreme Leader Snoke in The Last Jedi|first=Anthony|last=Breznican|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=November 22, 2017|accessdate=December 17, 2017}}</ref>

As powerful, cunning and cruel as he was, Snoke was no different from other masters of the dark side in that he still felt fear, specifically fear of Luke Skywalker<ref name="Snoke Bio Gallery" /> and the return of the Jedi. He was convinced that if Skywalker, the last living Jedi at the time, ever returned from exile, he would herald the rise of a new generation of [[Jedi Knight]]s.<ref name="Episode VII" /> He regarded the Jedi Order as a threat to his designs and, therefore, plotted to destroy it entirely by killing the last Jedi. Upon meeting Skywalker's final apprentice, the Jakku scavenger Rey, Snoke remarked that she possessed the qualities of a true Jedi and, as such, was resolved to see her die before she could also become a threat to his plans. As noted by Rey, however, Snoke was prone to underestimating those around him, such as his own apprentice. He exulted when sensing Ren's newfound resolve, completely unaware that the dark warrior intended to save Rey by striking down his own master through subterfuge. Indeed, very much like Sidious before him, Snoke failed to understand that Force visions are not absolute; he saw the truth, just not what he expected.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

===Physical appearance===

Snoke's appearance was frail, with large hands. He had a distinctive, idiosyncratic bone and facial structure.<ref name="EW">{{Cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/2015/11/12/star-wars-andy-serkis-supreme-leader-snoke/|title=Supreme Leader Snoke: Andy Serkis on the 'damaged' villain of Star Wars: The Force Awakens|publisher=''Entertainment Weekly''|last=Breznican|first=Anthony|date=November 12, 2015|accessdate=January 6, 2018}}</ref> His hologram used on the Starkiller Base projected him several times larger (around 25 [[Foot|feet]])<ref name="Empire">{{Cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/star-wars-exclusive-andy-serkis-talks-supreme-leader-snoke/|title=Supreme Leader Snoke: Andy Serkis talks Star Wars' latest villain|first=Emma|last=Thrower|work=Empire|date=November 17, 2015|accessdate=November 17, 2015}}</ref> than his natural appearance, towering over Kylo Ren and General Hux. Snoke had an elongated face with [[Color|pale]], heavily scarred skin and pale blue [[eye]]s.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Even in person, however, he was still very large, standing over seven feet in height.<ref name="People" /> He sported a large scar from the top of his head, all the way down to his brow. Snoke also had what appeared to be a scar or burn on his right cheek that caused his mouth to be contorted. Snoke's left cheekbone was malformed.<ref name="TLJ:TVD" /> During the cold war, Snoke wore a simple dark [[cloak]], and tended to speak slowly and enunciate his desires with a forceful undertone.<ref name="Episode VII" /> However, having moved from the shadows to rule openly with the advent of open war, Snoke's wardrobe changed to reflect his more materialistic side and his designs on ruling the galaxy; instead of the simple cloak, he now wore ornate golden khalat robes with a gray underdress, tied at the waist by an elegant golden belt<ref name="Episode VIII" /><ref name="Star Wars Force Link BB-8 2-in-1 Mega Playset">[http://a.dilcdn.com/bl/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/08/hasbro-star-wars-force-friday-2-bb-8-activity-set.jpg Star Wars Force Link BB-8 2-in-1 Mega Playset]</ref><ref name="Nerdist">{{Cite web|url=http://nerdist.com/star-wars-last-jedi-snoke-lego-nerdist-news/|title=New LEGO Leaks Reveal Snoke and THE LAST JEDI Spoilers|accessdate=2017-06-02|last=Marnell|first=Blair|date=2017-05-30|work=[[Wikipedia:Nerdist News|Nerdist]]|publisher=nerdist.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602024534/http://nerdist.com/star-wars-last-jedi-snoke-lego-nerdist-news/|archivedate=2017-06-02}}</ref>, and on his finger he wore a ring of gold and obsidian engraved with runes from the Four Sages of Dwartii. Because of his physical frailties, which left him past his prime in terms of physical strength, he relied on material comforts such as [[Snoke's slippers|slippers]] to deal with his ailing body which was in a constant state of pain due to his advanced age and wounds, and he could not defend himself in a physical fight, instead relying on his Elite Praetorian Guards to deal with any threats to him.<ref name="TLJ:TVD" />

==Powers and abilities==
{{Quote|There has been an awakening. Have you felt it?|audio=An Awakening.ogg|Snoke, to Kylo Ren|Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens}}
[[File:Snoke Lightning.png|thumb|300px|Though not a Sith, Kylo Ren's master was creative in the use of dark side techniques such as Force lightning.]]
While not trained as a Sith;<ref name="TLJ:TVD" /> nonetheless, Snoke was an extraordinarily powerful and skilled [[Force-sensitive]], having great mastery over the [[Force power|powers]] of the Force and was particularly strong with the dark side.<ref name="Snoke DB" />  His mastery of the Force was so great that Snoke was capable of exerting his power with the barest minimum of gestures to devastating effect even from great distances.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> From what is known, his abilities included [[telepathy]], [[Force choke]], and [[telekinesis]], which he was able to use on other beings even across great distances. Like his apprentice, Snoke possessed the power of [[mind probe]] and his skills were far greater, easily succesfully employing it on both Rey and Ren prior to his demise. As a master in the ways of the dark side, Snoke could conjure [[Force lightning]] from his fingertips&mdash;a power he perfected to the point where he could fire it down at a metal surface and let it ricochet right into the intended target.<ref name="AB Update">''[[Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know, Updated and Expanded]]''</ref><ref name="Episode VIII" /> The effects of his lightning-based attacks were immensely painful, as noted by Ren, who backed down in deference to Snoke's superior knowledge of the dark side.<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> While his physical strength atrophied along with his wounded body, Snoke remained tremendously strong in the Force until his death.<ref name="TLJ:TVD" />

Although both Rey and Ren possessed a raw connection to the Force,<ref name="Episode VIII" /> Snoke's abilities eclipsed their powers due to the greater knowledge and experience at the Supreme Leader's disposal.<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> In addition to subduing Ren with a single attack, Snoke toyed with Rey by telekinetically tossing her across his throne room. He could even overpower her when both were using the Force at the same time, as he demonstrated by overriding her control of the Skywalker lightsaber, causing it to avoid Rey's grasp before turning around and smacking her in the back of the head.<ref name="Episode VIII" />

Snoke had the ability to bridge the minds of two Force-sensitive individuals who were bonded through the Force. By using his powers to connect Ren and Rey to each other, the two were able to see and hear each other despite the millions of light-years that separated them. As their bond deepened, they could even make physical contact with one another.<ref name="Expanded Edition" /> Through it all, both remained oblivious to Snoke's third-party influence until he outright revealed his manipulation of their connection.<ref name="Episode VIII" /> In the end, however, Snoke's visions and Force senses failed him.<ref name="Snoke DB" /> While exulting at the resolve he sensed in his oft-conflicted apprentice, he did not sense his own impending death by the son of Han Solo.<ref name="Snoke Bio Gallery" />

[[File:Supreme Leader Snoke Bust.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Bust of Snoke created by Ivan Manzella]]
Snoke was portrayed by [[Andy Serkis]] via motion capture in the films [[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']] and [[Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi|''Star Wars'': Episode VIII ''The Last Jedi'']], the first two installments of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[sequel trilogy]], released in [[2015]] and [[2017]] respectively.<ref name="TFA credits">[[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']] credits</ref><ref name="Now Filming">{{SW|url=news/star-wars-episode-viii-now-filming|text=''Star Wars'': Episode VIII Now Filming}}</ref> His name was officially unveiled on [[May 28]], 2015,<ref name="Capturing a Galaxy">{{SW|url=news/capturing-a-galaxy-an-interview-with-annie-leibovitz-exclusive|text=Capturing a Galaxy: An Interview with Annie Leibovitz – Exclusive}}</ref> and his voice was first heard in the initial teaser trailer for ''The Force Awakens''.<ref name="10 things">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2014/12/17/the-10-things-andy-serkis-can-say-about-star-wars-the-force-awakens|title=Ten things Andy Serkis can say about 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens'|publisher=''Entertainment Weekly''|last=Breznican|first=Anthony|date=May 28, 2015|accessdate=May 28, 2015}}</ref><ref name="TFA Teaser">{{SWYoutube|erLk59H86ww|Star Wars: The Force Awakens Official Teaser Trailer}}</ref>

From the beginning of the production, the character who would ultimately fill the role as main antagonist of the film was nicknamed "Uber" though any specific ideas were clearly defined by that point.<ref name="Uber The Nickname">{{Twitter|PhilSzostak|status/1038903918359527424|[[Phil Szostak]]|quote=“Uber” was just a nickname for whoever the uber baddie might be. Again, I don’t think any of these ideas were clearly defined. The artists/production designers are free to pitch visual ideas before they have a place in the story.}}</ref> snoke's appearance underwent many changes throughout the development of ''The Force Awakens'', with the character's final appearance not being decided on until October 2015, two months before the film's release. [[J.J. Abrams]] and [[Neal Scanlan]] didn't want the character to look old and decrepit like Darth Sidious, and even considered making him female. [[Ivan Manzella]] sculpted at least two busts to try to hone the look of the character. Snoke's final appearance was based in part of the horror movies of [[Wikipedia:Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Films]], the conception being that Snoke was rather handsome in his younger days, but was consumed and twisted by the dark side as he became more powerful.<ref name="awakensart" /> Snoke's physical appearance in ''The Last Jedi'' was first shown in a leaked image of an upcoming LEGO set,<ref name="Nerdist" /> and was later officially revealed with the teaser image of the ''Star Wars'' Force Link BB-8 2-in-1 Mega Playset that was unveiled at [[Force Friday]] 2017.<ref name="Star Wars Force Link BB-8 2-in-1 Mega Playset" /> Andy Serkis wore artificial facial hair for this film.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/breathe-andrew-garfield-recalls-how-andy-serkis-briefly-directed-as-snoke-star-wars-1039767|title='Breathe': Andrew Garfield Recalls How Andy Serkis Briefly Directed as Snoke From 'Star Wars'|work=The Hollywood Reporter|last=Lee|first=Ashley|date=September 15, 2017|accessdate=September 19, 2017}}</ref>

In an interview with ''Entertainment Weekly ''in November 2017, Andy Serkis said that Snoke's injuries were inspired by injuries sustained by soldiers in the trenches of [[Wikipedia:World War I|World War I]].<ref name="EW Nov17">{{Cite web|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/11/22/star-wars-last-jedi-andy-serkis-snoke-backstory/|title='Star Wars: The Last Jedi:' Andy Serkis reveals Snoke's tortured history|publisher=''Entertainment Weekly''|last=Breznican|first=Anthony|date=November 22, 2017|accessdate=November 22, 2017}}</ref> In addition, in an interview with ''Empire'' magazine, Serkis claimed that the disfigurements Snoke possessed were caused in part by osteoporosis that was severe enough that he appeared "as twisted as a corkscrew", and that this was part of what made Snoke in his opinion "darker than Palpatine."<ref name="Empire Reveals New Look At Snoke From The Last Jedi" /> Serkis has gone on to say that Snoke's malevolence comes out in reaction to the injuries that he has suffered which he blames on the Resistance, fuelling his hatred for them. Serkis explained that Snoke's desire for power is motivated by greed, bitterness, and fear.

''The Last Jedi'' director [[Rian Johnson]] said he killed off Snoke to give Kylo Ren a compelling set-up for [[Star Wars: Episode IX|''Star Wars'': Episode IX]]. When asked if he had planned to elaborate on Snoke's back-story in Episode VIII, Johnson replied, "It would have stopped any of these scenes dead cold if he had stopped and given a 30-second speech about how he's [[Darth Plagueis]]. It doesn't matter to Rey. If he had done that, Rey would have blinked and said, 'Who?' And the scene would have gone on. [pause] And I'm not saying he's Darth Plagueis!".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/12/17/star-wars-last-jedi-spoilers-snoke-killed-theories/2/|title=The Last Jedi spoiler talk: Rian Johnson on Supreme Leader Snoke's startling scenes|work=Entertainment Weekly|first=Anthony|last=Breznican|date=2017-12-17|accessdate=2017-12-18}}</ref>

===Identity theories===
Upon the release of ''The Force Awakens'', multiple fan theories about Snoke's identity emerged online. The most famous was, however, that he was Darth Plagueis, Darth Sidious' [[Sith Master]] mentioned anecdotally in the [[2005]] film [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']], who possesed the power to prevent death.<ref name="Collider">{{Cite web|url=http://collider.com/star-wars-the-force-awakens-supreme-leader-snoke-theories-andy-serkis/|title=‘Star Wars: The Force Awakens': Theories on Supreme Leader Snoke|work=[[Wikipedia:Collider|Collider]]|first=Dave|last=Trumbore|date=2015-12-21|accessdate=2018-09-09}}</ref><ref name="Moviepilot 1">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202064955/https://moviepilot.com/posts/3702214|title=Supreme Leader Snoke's Role In Star Wars Episode 8 Revealed By John Williams?!|work=[[Wikipedia:Moviepilot|Moviepilot]]|first=Eleanor|last=Tremeer|date=2015-12-28|accessdate=2018-09-09}} {{C|Web archive}}</ref><ref name="International Business Times">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/star-wars-8-fan-theories-about-reys-origin-supreme-leader-snokes-identity-1535263|title=Star Wars 8: Fan theories about Rey's origin and Supreme Leader Snoke's identity|work=[[Wikipedia:Internation Business Times|Internation Business Times]]|first=Kabita|last=Maharana|date=2015-12-29|accessdate=2018-09-09}}</ref> Another popular fan theory was that Snoke was ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'' protagonist [[Ezra Bridger]].<ref name="Moviepilot 3">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160723103211/https://moviepilot.com/posts/3748108|title=https://web.archive.org/web/20160723103211/https://moviepilot.com/posts/3748108|work=[[Wikipedia:Moviepilot|Moviepilot]]|first=Robert|last=Myrick|date=2016-01-21|accessdate=2018-09-09}} {{C|Web archive}}</ref><ref name="Moviepilot 4">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160722140114/https://moviepilot.com/posts/4004493|title=Even More Evidence That Ezra From 'Star Wars: Rebels' Is Supreme Leader Snoke|work=[[Wikipedia:Moviepilot|Moviepilot]]|first=|last=|date=2016-07-18|accessdate=2018-09-09}} {{C|Web archive}}</ref><ref name="Looper">{{Cite web|url=https://www.looper.com/23860/theoryloop-ezra-bridger-really-supreme-leader-snoke/|title=Is Ezra Bridger really Supreme Leader Snoke?|work=[[Wikipedia:Looper (website)|Looper]]|first=Claire|last=Williams|date=2017-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-09}}</ref> [[Lucasfilm Story Group]]'s [[Pablo Hidalgo]] dismissed the Darth Plagueis theory in May [[2016]].<ref name="ComicBook.com">{{Cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/starwars/2016/05/10/star-wars-story-group-definitively-says-supreme-leader-snoke-is-/|title=Star Wars Story Group Definitively Says Supreme Leader Snoke is Not Darth Plagueis|work=ComicBook.com|first=|last=|date=2016-05-10|accessdate=2018-09-09}}</ref>
