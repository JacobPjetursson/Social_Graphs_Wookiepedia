{{Quote|To walk the path of the Jedi, one's spirit must be strong. That requires discipline.|Oppo Rancisis|Ultimate Star Wars}}
'''Oppo Rancisis''' was a [[Thisspiasian]] [[Sexes|male]] [[Jedi Master]] who served on the [[Jedi High Council|Jedi Council]] during the [[Invasion of Naboo]] and the [[Clone Wars]].

==Biography==
===Jedi career===
[[Reproduction|Born]] on [[Thisspias]],<ref name="Ultimate SW" /> Oppo Rancisis joined the [[Jedi Order]] during the final [[Standard Year|years]] of the [[Galactic Republic]] as an [[Youngling|infant]], and [[Sexes|he]] came to [[Jedi training|train]] under the [[Jedi Master]] [[Yaddle]]. At some point, Rancisis was offered the [[throne]] of his [[homeworld]], but he declined it to continue to serve [[the galaxy]] as a [[Jedi]]. Eventually, Rancisis was made a Jedi Master, and he took a seat in the [[Jedi High Council|High Council]], the governing body of the Jedi Order.<ref name="Character Encyclopedia" />

===Naboo Crisis===
[[File:High Council Chamber.png|thumb|left|250px|Oppo in the [[High Council Chamber]] with other Jedi members testing Anakin Skywalker]]
Shortly before the [[Battle of Naboo]], Rancisis was present in the [[Jedi Council Chamber|Council Chamber]] of the [[Jedi Temple]] on [[Coruscant]] when Jedi Master [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] came before the Council with news that the [[Sith]], the ancient enemies of the Jedi Order, had resurfaced. He later observed Jedi Master [[Mace Windu]] evaluate the [[The Force|Force]] abilities of [[Anakin Skywalker]], a nine-year-old boy from the planet [[Tatooine]] whom Jinn had discovered to be [[Force-sensitive]] and believed to be the [[Chosen One]], a being who was prophesied to bring balance to the Force. Although the child was strong in the Force, the Council denied Skywalker entrance into the Order as they found his deep emotional attachments troubling and believed that he was too old for training. The Council reversed their decision, however, after Jinn was [[Death|slain]] by the [[Sith Lord]] [[Maul|Darth Maul]] on [[Naboo]], allowing Skywalker to become the [[Padawan]] of Jinn's former apprentice [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], per Jinn's dying wish.<ref name="The Phantom Menace">[[Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace|''Star Wars'': Episode I ''The Phantom Menace'']]</ref>

===Separatist Crisis===
[[File:Jedicouncil2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Oppo in the High Council Chamber as the council are briefed by Obi-Wan Kenobi]]
Racisis still served on the Council ten years after the invasion of Naboo. During this time thousands of star systems joined a [[Seperatist Crisis|secessionist movement]] who wanted independence from the [[Galactic Republic]]. The council feared that if a pan-[[the galaxy|galactic]] war to break out they wouldn't have enough manpower to defend the Republic from the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatist]] threat. Around this time the life of [[Senator]] [[Padme Amidala]] was threatened by an [[Plot to assassinate Padme Amidala|assassination attempt]], causing the Council to assign Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker as protection for the Senator. This eventually lead to Obi-Wan discovering that a [[clone trooper|Clone army]] was being [[cloning|manufactured]] in secret on the world of [[Kamino]] at the request of Jedi Master [[Sifo-Dyas]], who had perished some years prior. Rancisis was present on Coruscant when the Council was brought this news, troubled by this information the council sent Obi-Wan to [[Geonosis]] to track down the [[bounty hunter]] [[Jango Fett]], who was the man responsible for the attempts on Amidala's life as well as providing the genetic template for the clone Army. This request ultimately lead to the beginning of the pan-galactic conflict known as the [[Clone Wars]], as the [[Confederacy military|Separatist army]] and the new [[Grand Army of the Republic]] fought each other in what would become known as the [[Battle of Geonosis|first battle of Geonosis]].

===Clone Wars===
====Occupation of Hissrich====
Shortly after the outbreak of the Clone Wars Rancisis was present in a council meeting briefing Master Windu on a task they had for the esteemed master. Scouts had discovered that the Separatist Alliance had occupied the [[Outer Rim Territories|Outer Rim]] world of [[Hissrich]]. The council feared that the Confederacy were attempting to utilize the backwater planet as a staging ground to assault neighboring [[star system|systems]]. In order to discern the threat level of the occupation the Council tasked Master Windu alongside Master [[Kit Fisto|Fisto]], Master [[Tenth Brother|Dibs]] and [[Knight]] [[Rissa Mano|Mano]] to run a covert information seeking mission on the threat.<ref name="Mace Windu, Part I"> ''[[Jedi of the Republic—Mace Windu, Part I]]''</ref>

During the mission Master Prosset Dibs defected from the Jedi Order and attempted to end the life of Windu, however he was beaten by the superior dualist who arrested him for treason. Rancisis was present during the sentencing of Dibs during which he accused the Order of forsaking their own teachings by fighting in the war. The order intended to put the rogue master to death but Windu intervened in the sentencing, demanding that he be imprisoned which the council agreed to.<ref name="Mace Windu, Part V"> ''[[Jedi of the Republic—Mace Windu, Part V]]''</ref>

====Bardotta Crisis====
[[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] informed the Jedi High Council of [[Queen]] [[Julia]] of [[Bardotta]]'s request for [[Jar Jar Binks]] to assist her after the disappearance of [[Dagoyan Masters]]. Oppo, and the rest of the council discussed the matter and [[Mace Windu]] volunteered to accompany Binks.<ref name="The Disappeared, Part I">{{TCW|The Disappeared, Part I}}</ref>

====Tyranus revealed====
[[File:Fisto council2.png|thumb|left|250px]]
Rancisis was present when Plo Koon revealed that he found the lightsaber of Sifo-Dyas. Yoda confirmed that it was, and decided they needed to investigate. While on a [[Mission to Oba Diah (Clone Wars)|mission]] to uncover the [[Mission to Oba Diah (pre–Naboo Crisis)|death]] of Master [[Sifo-Dyas]] who ordered the creation of the [[Grand Army of the Republic|clone army]], Rancisis was present when Kenobi and Skywalker reported that [[Count]] [[Dooku]] was behind with the creation of the [[Cloning|clone]] [[army]]. The Council kept it a secret out of concern for how it could affect public support for the Republic.<ref name="The Lost One">{{TCW|The Lost One}}</ref>

====Specter of the past====
Rancisis was present when [[Grand Master]] [[Yoda]] claimed to hear the voice of a long-dead Qui-Gon. Rancisis along with the other members of the Council participated in [[meditation]] in order to see if the Masters could sense Jinn's presence.<ref name="Voices">{{TCW|Voices}}</ref>

====Separatists Conspiracy on Utapau====
[[File:Oppo-ti-fisto-thebigbang.png|thumb|right|250px|Oppo Rancisis, Shaak Ti and Kit Fisto on the Jedi Council]]
Towards the end of the [[Clone Wars|war]], Rancisis was present when Kenobi told the Council that [[Sugi]] [[arms dealer]]s were attempting to sell an enormous [[kyber crystal]] to [[General]] [[Grievous]] on [[Utapau]]. When Kenobi and Skywalker reported to the Council after the [[Mission to Utapau|destruction]] of the [[crystal]], Yoda recalled stories of when the Jedi and Sith fought for control of the [[galaxy]] using [[Superweapon|weapons]] powered by kyber crystals.<ref name="The Big Bang">{{TCW|The Big Bang}}</ref>

===During the Imperial Era===
At the end of the Clone Wars, the [[clone trooper]]s turned on the Jedi Order by [[Order 66|command]] of the Supreme Chancellor. A large majority of the Jedi Order was wiped out in this initial attack, however some Jedi were able to escape the servants of the newly formed [[Galactic Empire]]. After the [[hunt for Eeth Koth]] Oppo Rancisis was on a list of known survivors of the purge compiled by the jedi hunters known as the [[Inquisitorius]].<ref name="Dark Lord 19">''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 19: Fortress Vader, Part I]]''</ref>

Rancisis was set to make several other appearances in ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' television series before its cancellation. One such appearance was seen in the [[The Clone Wars: The Lost Missions|Sixth season]] and the other was in the [[The Clone Wars Legacy|Legacy project]].
