==Behind the scenes==
C'ai Threnalli first appeared in [[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']],<ref name="TFA" /> where actor [[Paul Kasey]] came into sight wearing the costume of [[Ello Asty]] in one of the final scenes of the movie.<ref name="Creatures">[[Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens|''Star Wars'': Episode VII ''The Force Awakens'']] &mdash; "Crafting Creatures" BluRay featurette</ref> As Asty's death had been shown earlier in the film,<ref name="TFA" /> [[Lucasfilm Story Group]] member [[Pablo Hidalgo]] stated that the Abednedo seen waving off the ''Falcon'' in that scene must be a separate pilot.<ref name="Fellow pilot">{{Twitter|pablohidalgo|status/703118364462284801|[[Pablo Hidalgo]]|quote=That's another Abednedo (well, it's the same costume, but we did see Ello die, so therefore, it's another one).|image=File:Other costume tweet.png|noimage=}}</ref> The design for Threnalli was created by creature concept designer [[Jake Lunt Davies]], while his costume was made by costume designner [[Michael Kaplan]].<ref name="TLJ SDCC" />
Alongside Paul Kasey performing C’ai Threnalli was ‘Animatronic Facial Performer’ Phill Woodfine.

This character went unnamed until appearing in the "Escape from Starkiller Base" DLC expansion for the [[video game]] ''[[LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'', which starred Threnalli, voiced by [[Christian Simpson]], crashing in a [[T-70 X-wing starfighter]] during the Assault on Starkiller and then fighting through [[First Order]] forces and escaping the planet's surface alongside fellow Resistance members [[Lieutenant]] [[Wright]] and [[R3-X3]].<ref name="Lego" /> Story Group member [[Leland Chee]] confirmed on Twitter that the idea was for Threnalli to be the unnamed pilot from the film.<ref name="C'ai Threnalli Twitter">{{Twitter|holocronkeeper|status/856883334948847616|[[Leland Chee]]|quote=That's the idea, yes.
