The '''Seventh Sister''' was a [[Sexes|female]] [[Mirialan]] Inquisitor who served the [[Galactic Empire]] and operated as a [[Jedi hunter]] in the [[Standard year|years]] before the [[Battle of Yavin]]. She was tasked with tracking down [[Ahsoka Tano]], a prominent figure in the rebellion against the Empire, by the [[Sith Lord]] [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]]. Following the death of [[the Grand Inquisitor]], the Seventh Sister sought to replace him as the leader of the [[Inquisitorius]].

In the fourth year before the Battle of Yavin, the Seventh Sister came into direct conflict with the [[Spectres]]. She fought them on many occasions: aboard an [[Galactic Republic|Old Republic]] [[Haven-class medical station|medical station]], in [[Hammertown]] on the [[planet]] [[Takobo]] in an attempt to kidnap [[Force-sensitive]] children, and on [[Garel]] in an attempt to destroy the [[Phoenix Cell|rebel fleet]]. The Seventh Sister was ultimately killed by [[Maul]] on [[Malachor]].

==Biography==
===Fallen Jedi===
[[File:Seventh Sister EaW.png|left|thumb|250px|Formerly part of the Jedi Order, now a servant of the Emperor]]
The individual who became known as the Seventh Sister originally occupied a position within the [[Jedi Order]]. At some point after the [[Galactic Republic]] was reorganized into the [[Galactic Empire]], she was inducted into an Imperial agency of [[Force-sensitive]] assassins called the [[Inquisitorius]], which was tasked with hunting down and eliminating any [[Jedi]] who survived [[Order 66]]. To accomplish this, she and her [[Brother/Sister|colleagues]] were trained by [[The Grand Inquisitor]] in [[The Works]], but soon fell under the command of [[Anakin Skywalker|Darth Vader]] when [[Darth Sidious]] first demonstrated the Inquisitorius to Vader in the [[Inquisitorius Headquarters]], who continued their training in the ways of the [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]] of [[the Force]].<ref name="Dark Lord 6" /><ref name="Dark Lord 7" />

===Age of the Empire===

====Hunting Jedi====
Following the [[Hunt for Eeth Koth]], the Seventh Sister celebrated the death of the former [[Eeth Koth|Jedi]] alongside the other Inquisitors.<ref name="Dark Lord 19">''[[Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith 19: Fortress Vader, Part I]]''</ref>

====Serving the Empire====
The Seventh Sister was dispatched by the Sith Lord Darth Vader to deal with the growing rebellion against the Empire, as well as to hunt down the former [[Padawan|Jedi Padawan]] [[Ahsoka Tano]]. This brought the Seventh Sister into conflict with the Spectres, who flew a [[starship]] known as the ''[[Ghost]]''.<ref name="Siege">''[[Star Wars Rebels: The Siege of Lothal]]''</ref><ref name="Always" />

====Skirmish aboard the medical station====
{{Quote|What is that?''"<br />"''My pet told me you were here. I have been looking for you for some time.''"<br />"''A bounty hunter?''"<br />"''Guess again.|The Seventh Sister reveals herself to Ezra Bridger|Always Two There Are}}
[[File:Always Two There Are thumb.jpg|thumb|250px|The Seventh Sister approaches Ezra Bridger and Sabine Wren on a Republic medical station.]]
The Seventh Sister was ordered to scout an abandoned Republic medical station. One of her [[ID9 seeker droid]]s reported seeing [[Sabine Wren|a rebel]]. Meanwhile, another proceeded to knock out [[C1-10P|Chopper]]. As [[Ezra Bridger]] and Sabine Wren searched the medical station for supplies, they found themselves standing face-to-face with the Seventh Sister. Ezra mistook the Inquisitor for a [[bounty hunter]]; she revealed her true nature to the boy by activating her lightsaber. Outmatched, Ezra and Sabine fled, only to run into their attacker's accomplice, the [[Fifth Brother]]. With the help of her 'little pets', the Seventh Sister succeeded in capturing Ezra and remarked on the nobility of his sacrifice to let Sabine escape. At that moment, the Fifth Brother attempted to murder Bridger on the spot but the Sister deflected it lazily with her own blade whilst commenting on her surprise at seeing him there as well. When the Brother protested at her having stolen his kill, she derided him for his short-sightedness and sent him off with two of her droids to capture the girl so she could use him as bait to lure out the other rebels.<ref name="Always" />

The Seventh Sister brought Ezra to the medical station's command center to slowly break him by using psychological tactics, a combination of threats, taunts and Force powers, including an attempted [[Mind probe (Force power)|mind probe]]. Ezra refused to break and fired back with a few taunts of his own, vaguely impressing her but also causing her to lose patience as he continued to resist. When the Brother returned with an unconscious Sabine, he asked if she had made any progress in getting the boy to talk but she refused to answer directly to cover her embarrassment. Ezra and Sabine were then contacted by [[Garazeb Orrelios]], who was using the pseudonym "[[Commander]] [[Meiloorun fruit|Meiloorun]]" and told them to rendezvous with him at Bay Six, as well as to keep their "chins up." The Seventh Sister saw her chance to destroy the rebels once and for all.<ref name="Always" />

[[File:Seventh Sister Interrogating.png|thumb|left|250px|The Seventh Sister interrogating Ezra.]]
At Bay Six, Zeb ambushed the Seventh Sister and Fifth Brother from aboard the ''[[Phantom]]'', allowing Ezra and Sabine to escape onto the ship. The Inquisitors used [[telekinesis]] to pull the rebel ship towards them in an attempt to prevent its escape, with the Sister also using her powers to close the hangar doors. Sabine started to shoot at the Fifth Brother, forcing him to break off to deflect the shots. Unable to hold the ship herself, the Seventh Sister was almost pulled out into the vacuum of space as the ''Phantom'' escaped with the rebels onboard. Realizing she had failed to complete her objective in the presence of another Inquisitor, the Seventh Sister became flustered.<ref name="Always" />

====Abducting children====
{{Quote|I know why you want the children.''"<br />"''Well, who doesn't want to be a mother?|Ahsoka Tano and the Seventh Sister|The Future of the Force}}
Following their failure to capture the rebels aboard the Republic medical station, the Seventh Sister and Fifth Brother boarded a passenger ship above the planet [[Chandel]] to seize a Force-sensitive infant named [[Alora (child)|Alora]]. They succeeded and killed everyone aboard the ship, save for the child's grandmother, [[Darja]]. This act attracted the attention of the Spectres and Ahsoka Tano.<ref name="Future of the Force">{{Rebels|The Future of the Force}}</ref>

The Seventh Sister next traveled with the Fifth Brother to Takobo to capture an [[Ithorian]] infant named [[Pypey]]. They confronted the child's mother, [[Oora]], and when they learned their target had been sent away in the care of a droid, they smashed all of the furniture in Oora's home.<ref name="Future of the Force" />

In the streets of Takobo, the Seventh Sister and Fifth Brother managed to intercept the droid that had left with Pypey; the child was nowhere in sight, for he had been taken by the [[Lasat]] rebel Zeb. The Seventh Sister and Fifth Brother pursued Zeb to a nearby apartment; they entered it only for Ezra Bridger to escape with Pypey.<ref name="Future of the Force" />

After failing to lure out their quarry, the Seventh Sister and Fifth Brother faced Kanan Jarrus and Zeb. The pair of Inquisitors bested the two rebels, who escaped on a speeder. The Seventh Sister and Fifth Brother gave chase on a speeder of their own; after another skirmish, the Inquisitors cornered their foes outside the local spaceport.<ref name="Future of the Force" />

[[File:Ahsoka vs the Seventh Sister.png|thumb|250px|Ahsoka grabs the Seventh Sister's lightsaber and uses the Force to shut it off.]]
The Seventh Sister and Fifth Brother successfully overpowered Kanan, Ezra, and Zeb once again. However, before the Inquisitors could finish the trio of rebels off, Ahsoka Tano appeared before them. Surprised but delighted by this, the Seventh Sister and Fifth Brother engaged their former Jedi prey in combat while Ezra, Kanan, and Zeb escaped with Pypey aboard the ''Phantom''. However, it was quickly shown that both Seventh Sister and Fifth Brother were no match for Ahsoka, who easily overpowered the Brother and knocked him out before suddenly kneeling in apparent surrender; leaping in for the kill, the Seventh Sister was flabbergasted when the [[Togruta]] grabbed her spinning lightsaber, deactivated it using the Force, and tossed it aside before telekinetically throwing her against a nearby pillar. Ahsoka claimed she had beaten the Seventh Sister, but the Inquisitor laughed maniacally as Imperial reinforcements arrived in the form of [[stormtrooper]]s and a few [[Imperial Troop Transport]]s. While the Seventh Sister intended to capture Ahsoka and please Darth Vader, the rebel commander managed to make a getaway with her comrades and the successfully reclaimed Force-sensitive infants.<ref name="Future of the Force" />

Adding insult to injury, the Seventh Sister and Fifth Brother discovered that the Spectres had destroyed their TIE Advanced fighters. The Inquisitors were elated, however, when one of the Seventh Sister's droid "pets" revealed that the enemy was hiding on the planet [[Garel]].<ref name="Future of the Force" />

====Raid on Garel====
{{Quote|Well, ''hello'' there.''"<br />"''You're not going to get in my way!''"<br />"''Well then, my ''brave'', young boy, come and prove it!|The Seventh Sister and Ezra Bridger|Legacy (episode)|Legacy}}
[[File:Legacy Inquisitors.png|thumb|left|250px|The Seventh Sister and Fifth Brother come face-to-face with Ezra Bridger.]]
Together with [[Agent]] [[Alexsandr Kallus|Kallus]] and [[Admiral]] [[Kassius Konstantine]], the Seventh Sister and Fifth Brother attacked the [[Phoenix Cell]], of which the Spectres were a part, on Garel. The pair of Inquisitors faced Ezra Bridger and Kanan Jarrus in a hangar bay. The Seventh Sister managed to goad Ezra into attacking her, but Kanan shut a blast door that was between them, thus preventing a fight from taking place. The crew of the ''Ghost'' then took advantage of this delay and escaped into Garel's atmosphere.<ref name="Legacy">{{Rebels|Legacy (episode)|Legacy}}</ref>

====Jedi Temple on Lothal====
{{Quote|The secrets of this temple will be ours.|The Seventh Sister|Shroud of Darkness}}
[[File:Kanan and Ezra fight the Inquisitors.png|thumb|250px|Kanan and Ezra face the Seventh Sister and Fifth Brother on Oosalon.]]
On the planet [[Oosalon]], the Seventh Sister and Fifth Brother engaged Kanan Jarrus and Ezra Bridger in a [[Lightsaber combat|lightsaber duel]]; overpowered, the Jedi managed to escape their attackers on the back of a [[tibidee]].<ref name="Shroud">{{Rebels|Shroud of Darkness}}</ref>

The Seventh Sister and Fifth Brother were able to track Kanan and Ezra to Lothal; via one of the Seventh Sister's seeker droids, they discovered [[Lothal Jedi Temple|an ancient Jedi Temple]] on the planet's surface. The pair of Inquisitors used the Force to summon the temple from under the ground, though it put up a fight; lightsabers at the ready, the duo entered its depths only to be attacked by the manifestations of several [[Jedi Temple Guard]]s, including one who resembled the Grand Inquisitor.<ref name="Shroud" />

In the aftermath of this encounter, the Seventh Sister and Fifth Brother found themselves in the presence of Darth Vader. The Sith Lord coldly stated that the rebels' growing power would be their undoing.<ref name="Shroud" />

====Mission to Malachor and death====
{{Quote|Strike her down! You want to end this? Finish her!|[[Maul]] to [[Ezra Bridger]]|Twilight of the Apprentice}}
[[File:Seventh Sister choked.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Seventh Sister is rendered helpless by Maul as Ezra prepares to strike her down.]]
The Seventh Sister was ordered by Darth Vader to [[Mission to Malachor|travel]] to Malachor with the Fifth Brother and obtain a [[Sith holocron]] from within a [[Malachor Sith Temple|Sith temple]] located beneath the planet's surface. She and her accomplice came to the aid of the [[Eighth Brother]] after he was captured by Kanan Jarrus and Ahsoka Tano; all three Inquisitors were forced to retreat when their opponents were joined by Ezra Bridger and his new companion, the former Sith Lord [[Maul]]. Having escaped her adversaries, the Seventh Sister dispatched some of her ID9 seeker droids to spy on them.<ref name="Twilight" />

The Seventh Sister later attacked Ezra and Maul as they scaled the Sith temple in an attempt to reach a chamber at its top. The Inquisitor was engaged by Ezra in a brief lightsaber duel; she was then lifted into the air by Maul and overcome with terror when the former Sith Lord ordered Bridger to execute her. The young Jedi could not bring himself to do so, much to her smug relief, but Maul had no such restraint and hurled his own weapon at her head. Powerless, she could only scream before either of the twin blades slashed across her body, much to Ezra's horror. Maul then released his grip on the Seventh Sister's bisected corpse, letting it fall to the ground. Her fellow Inquisitors would also fall soon after.<ref name="Twilight" />

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|You've crawled out of hiding&hellip; at last.|The Seventh Sister, to Kanan Jarrus|The Future of the Force}}
The Seventh Sister kept a tight hold on her emotions and spoke calmly, even during combat. She favored agility over brute strength, and she had a certain level of respect for her opponents. The Seventh Sister often disagreed with the methods of the Fifth Brother; this suggested a rivalry between the two.<ref name="Always" /> Unlike the Fifth Brother, she was tactically minded and often used cutting barbs or sarcastic comments when sparring with her opponents to put them off-guard. She would often engage her opponents in flirtatious banter, occasionally bordering on seductive, and use her probe droids in combat to distract them. The Seventh Sister also demonstrated occasional sadism and willingness to torture, as shown when she remarked that she only needed Ezra alive and not in one piece, clearly threatening dismemberment if he didn't start talking.

Like the Grand Inquisitor and Fifth Brother, the Seventh Sister wore [[Color|black]] armor. Her pointed helmet had a retractable faceplate; this hid her yellow skin and red facial [[tattoo]]s from view. The Seventh Sister's eyes were yellow in coloration; her sclera were black. The symbol of the Galactic Empire appeared on the Seventh Sister's shoulders, and the portions of her gloves that covered the palms of her hands were red.

==Powers and abilities==
The Seventh Sister was trained to use the dark side of the Force for the purpose of hunting and killing Jedi. She was an agile and acrobatic fighter and skilled with a lightsaber. She was capable of dueling Ezra Bridger and Kanan Jarrus, but she could not match the skills of more skilled and experienced combatants, such as Darth Maul or Ahsoka Tano.

She relied less on the Force than the Fifth Brother, often preferring to use her lightsaber instead. As such, she proved capable of using the Force to augment her natural speed and agility and could use it to perform telekinesis, holding back the Phantom with great amounts of effort, while simultaneously shutting massive hanger doors, and raising an ancient Jedi Temple, although all with the Fifth Brother's aid. She could also induce pain with the mind probe, as well as levitate and manipulate objects and people with the Force. Despite being less bulky than the Fifth Brother, she was apparently a lot tougher as she recovered almost instantly from being telekinetically hurled against a stone pillar hard enough that it cracked under the impact, while the Brother was rendered unconscious from a relatively lesser blow to the head against the same pillar.

==Equipment==
[[File:SeventhSistersLightsaber.png|thumb|200px|The Seventh Sister's lightsaber]]
Like all Inquisitors, the Seventh Sister carried a [[Seventh Sister's lightsaber|double-bladed, spinning lightsaber]]. The weapon had two spikes and ornate engravings on its ringed emitter, and it was worn on the Seventh Sister's belt when not in use. It was lost on Malachor when she was killed by Maul.

The Seventh Sister also possessed several ID9 seeker droids; these could be dispensed from a hole in the armor on her back.

==Behind the scenes==
The Seventh Sister was created for the [[Star Wars Rebels Season Two|second season]] of ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]''. She is voiced by [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]], who is married to [[Freddie Prinze Jr.]], the voice of Kanan Jarrus.<ref name="Unmasked">{{SW|url=video/the-seventh-sister-unmasked-star-wars-rebels|text=The Seventh Sister Unmasked - ''Star Wars Rebels''}}</ref>
