{{Quote|Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still a leading member of the Jedi Council, is he not?|Lama Su, to Obi-Wan Kenobi|Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones}}
'''Sifo-Dyas''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] [[Jedi Master]] who commissioned the [[Kaminoan]]s' creation of the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] over a [[Standard decade|decade]] before the [[Clone Wars]]. A [[Jedi]] from the [[Cassandran Worlds]], Sifo-Dyas was gifted with the [[Force power|power]] of [[Force vision|foresight]], and he earned a seat on the [[Jedi High Council]] prior to the [[Invasion of Naboo]]. When he foresaw a coming war that would ravage [[the galaxy]], he believed that the [[Galactic Republic]] would require an [[army]] if it were to prevail. Yet, his peers on the Jedi Council rejected his notions, leading to his removal from the Council. Nevertheless, he pursued his ideas in secret and contacted the Kaminoan [[Cloning|cloners]], purporting to have the authorization of the Council and the [[Galactic Senate]] to raise an army for the Republic. In doing so, he unknowingly entered the crosshairs of the [[Sith]], who set out to assume control of his cloning project.

Around the [[time]] of the Invasion of Naboo, [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Finis Valorum]] requested Sifo-Dyas conduct [[Mission to Oba Diah (pre–Naboo Crisis)|clandestine negotiations]] with the [[Pyke Syndicate]], and he headed for [[Oba Diah]] with Valorum's personal [[aide]], [[Silman]]. However, the [[Dark Lord of the Sith|Sith Lord]] [[Dooku|Darth Tyranus]] hired the [[Pyke]]s to target Sifo-Dyas's [[Jedi T-6 shuttle 775519|T-6 shuttle]], and they shot down his [[Starship|ship]] over the [[Oba Diah moon]]. Sifo-Dyas [[Death|died]] in the resulting crash, but Silman survived and was taken [[prisoner]] by the Pykes. Consequently, Tyranus and his [[Sith Master]], [[Darth Sidious]], funded Sifo-Dyas's army of [[clone trooper]]s, instructed the Kaminoan cloners to add Order 66 to the clones' inhibitor chips (which Sifo-Dyas originally intended to be a safeguard against any treacherous orders given to clones), and manipulated the [[Jedi Order]] into taking command of the army when the Clone Wars [[Battle of Geonosis|erupted]]. It was not until years later that the Jedi began to unravel the Sith's conspiracy and [[Mission to Oba Diah (Clone Wars)|unearthed]] the details of Sifo-Dyas's demise.

==Biography==
{{Quote|Prior to the blockade of Naboo, Sifo-Dyas sat on this Council until we judged his ideas to be too extreme.|Mace Windu|The Lost One}}
[[Homeworld|Hailing]] from the [[Cassandran Worlds]],<ref name="USW" /> [[Jedi Master]] Sifo-Dyas was a leading member of the [[Jedi High Council]], the governing body of the [[Jedi Order]], in the last decades of the [[Galactic Republic]]. However, some time prior to the [[Invasion of Naboo]], tensions arose between Sifo-Dyas and his fellow councilors. Foreseeing an upcoming full-scale conflict, he started advocating for the creation of an army for the Republic. The rest of the High Council deemed his ideas too extreme, and Sifo-Dyas was removed from his position. Even though the other Jedi had rejected his project, he found a way to carry it out without their consent. Sifo-Dyas contacted the [[Kaminoan]]s, who were reputed for their [[Cloning|clone]] hatcheries, and secretly commissioned them to grow a clone army for the Republic,<ref name="The Lost One" /> which he pretended was a request of the [[Galactic Senate]].<ref name="AOTC" />

Some time later, Master Sifo-Dyas was sent on a secret mission by [[Finis Valorum]], the [[Supreme Chancellor]] of the Republic, who asked him to deal with the [[Pyke Syndicate]]. Valorum also asked his personal aide, [[Silman]], to accompany the Jedi on his way to the [[planet]] [[Oba Diah]], where the Pykes were headquartered. However, Sifo-Dyas was never able to complete the Chancellor's mission, as the High Council called him to deal with another conflict: on [[Felucia]], a skirmish had broken out between the local tribes, and Sifo-Dyas was assigned to quell the conflict. As a consequence, both Sifo-Dyas and Silman were diverted to Felucia aboard [[T-6 shuttle]] [[Jedi T-6 shuttle 775519|77519]].<ref name="The Lost One" />

===Death over the Oba Diah moon===
{{Quote|Tyranus wanted Sifo-Dyas dead. The Pykes were well paid to shoot down his ship. However, any man that is willing to pay to have a Jedi killed is dangerous and unpredictable.|Lom Pyke|The Lost One}}
[[File:SifoDyas_file.png|thumb|left|250px|Sifo-Dyas' official file in the Republic records]]
However, neither man would ever reach their destination. In the shadows, the [[Sith]] wished to take over the clone army in the future, and they plotted against Sifo-Dyas' life. [[Count]] [[Dooku]] of [[Serenno]], a defrocked Jedi now known as the Sith Lord named Darth Tyranus, hired the Pykes to kill Sifo-Dyas. Since those criminals wished to gain an advantage over rival crime families, they accepted Tyranus' offer and shot down Sifo-Dyas' shuttle over the [[Oba Diah moon]]. After inspecting the wreckage, they turned over the Jedi Master's corpse to Tyranus as proof of their deal fulfilled. While Sifo-Dyas had died in the crash, Silman was still alive when the Pykes inspected the wreckage. They decided to keep the Chancellor's aide locked up in their prison as insurance, recognizing that dealing with a Sith Lord like Tyranus would require it.<ref name="The Lost One" />

===Legacy===
{{Quote|They said Master Sifo-Dyas placed an order for a clone army at the request of the Senate almost ten years ago. I was under the impression that he was killed before that.|Obi-Wan Kenobi|Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones}}
Ten years after the Jedi Master's death, the army he had commissioned was discovered by [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], a [[Jedi Knight]] who was investigating on Kamino following the murder of the [[bounty hunter]] [[Zam Wesell]] by a mysterious colleague of hers, [[Jango Fett]]. To his great surprise, Kenobi was greeted by [[Taun We]], a Kaminoan, as if they had been expecting his visit for some time. [[Prime Minister]] [[Lama Su]] then informed the Jedi of the progress of the clone army ordered by Sifo-Dyas some ten years ago. Although he did not know what the cloners were talking about, Kenobi played along so he could learn more. He bluffed his way into the heart of the hatcheries, and was introduced to the original source of the clones, which was none other than Jango Fett. As soon as he took leave of the Kaminoans, Kenobi contacted the High Council and told them of the clone army and how Sifo-Dyas was supposed to have commissioned it. The Council members, however, had been completely unaware of it for ten years. Ultimately, Sifo-Dyas' clone army ended up being used at the behest of the Republic, and the conflict between the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems|Separatists]] and the Republic was named "the [[Clone Wars]]" after it.<ref name="AOTC" />

[[File:Sifo-Dyas Illusion.png|thumb|250px|An illusion of Sifo-Dyas on Moraband]]
Toward the end of the Clone Wars, a Jedi mission led by [[Plo Koon]] and Commander [[CC-3636|Wolffe]] found a [[Sifo-Dyas' lightsaber (Oba Diah)|lightsaber]] belonging to the long-dead Sifo-Dyas on Oba Diah's [[moon]]. This unexpected discovery prompted Yoda, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Anakin Skywalker to investigate his decade-old disappearance. Meanwhile, Tyranus' master, the mysterious [[Darth Sidious]], was furious to discover that the Jedi were investigating the loose end that was Sifo-Dyas. He ordered Tyranus to clean up his affairs before it was too late.<ref name="The Lost One" />

As part of the Sith illusions created by Darth Sidious and Darth Tyranus' ritual, Sifo-Dyas appeared to Yoda on [[Moraband]]. His phantom was being tortured, bound by electricity. The specter begged Yoda to release him, offering in exchange the identity of the Sith Lord. However, Yoda saw through him with his Sith eyes and refused the offer, causing him to merge into Sidious.<ref name="Sacrifice">{{TCW|Sacrifice}}</ref>

In [[19 BBY]], during the [[Standard year|last year]] of the Clone Wars, Sifo-Dyas's clone army was [[Order 66|commissioned]] by Chancellor Palpatine, who finally unveiled himself as Darth Sidious, to turn against the Jedi Order, initiating the [[Jedi Purge]], which saw the death of several Jedi Masters. In an ironic twist of fate, unknownwingly manipulated by the Sith Lords, Sifo-Dyas contributed to the destruction of the Jedi in his effort to save the Order.<ref name"ROTS">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']]</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
In early drafts of ''[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'', the name of the Jedi who contacted the Kaminoans was '''Sido-Dyas''', and was originally a false identity for Darth Sidious—Obi-Wan Kenobi claimed to have never heard of him, and [[Mace Windu]] confirmed no Jedi of that name existed. The spelling "Sifo-Dyas" appears in one draft as a typing error that Lucas preferred to the original name;<ref name="draftscript">[http://sfy.ru/sfy.html?script=star_wars_episode_2 ''Attack of the Clones'' draft script], URL accessed on [[September 6]], [[2007]]</ref> thus the scenario of the Jedi's identity was rewritten. Additionally, the Jedi Master's name was changed in the Portuguese translation to '''Zaifo-Vias''', since his original name sounded much like "se fodias," a vulgar expression in Brazil.<ref>[[:pt:Zaifo-Vias#Nos_bastidores|http://pt.starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Zaifo-Vias#Nos_bastidores]]</ref>

His backstory was originally promised by [[George Lucas]] to be revealed in [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']].<ref name="AOTC DVD commentary">[[Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones|''Star Wars'': Episode II ''Attack of the Clones'']] DVD commentary</ref> However, once Lucas refocused the film's story to center on Anakin, he was forced to cut several plot points related to ''Attack of the Clones'', including Sifo-Dyas' backstory.<ref name="ROTS DVD commentary">[[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']] DVD commentary</ref> It wasn't until "[[The Lost One]]," a [[The Clone Wars: The Lost Missions|sixth season]] episode of ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'', that the character was given a [[canon]] background. He was voiced by [[Paul Nakauchi]] for his appearance as a hallucination in the episode "[[Sacrifice]]."
