{{Quote|Gideon Hask. First in his class at Coruscant Imperial University. Served with valor aboard the ''Mandate'', receiving a battlefield promotion and the Crimson Star for exceptional performance against the enemy.|Admiral Garrick Versio|Battlefront II: Inferno Squad}}
'''Gideon Hask''', nicknamed "'''Gid'''," was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] [[Homeworld|native]] of the [[planet]] [[Kuat]]. During the [[Galactic Civil War]], Hask served as a [[soldier]] and [[starfighter]] [[pilot]] before joining the ranks of [[Inferno Squad]]&mdash;an [[Special forces|elite]] [[commando]] [[Squad|unit]] of the [[Galactic Empire]]. After witnessing the destruction of the [[Death Star II|second Death Star]] at the [[Battle of Endor]] in [[4 ABY]], Hask and his team were reassigned to [[Operation: Cinder]], a [[Contingency|plan]] devised by [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]] to [[Climate disruption array|devastate]] several worlds in the event of his [[death]]. His support for the late Emperor's plan brought Hask into direct [[Skirmish on Vardos|conflict]] with his teammates, [[Commander]] [[Iden Versio]] and [[Del Meeko]], both of whom [[Inferno Squad (New Republic)|defected]] to the [[New Republic]] as a result of the execution of Operation: Cinder on [[Vardos]]&mdash;a planet noted for its loyalty to the Empire. Promoted to the [[Military rank|rank]] of Commander by [[Admiral]] [[Garrick Versio]], Iden's [[Parent|father]], Hask supported the [[Jakku Imperial remnant|Imperial remnant]] led by [[Counselor to the Empire|Counselor]] [[Gallius Rax]] against the [[New Republic military|forces]] of the Republic at the [[Battle of Jakku]] in [[5 ABY]]. Although Hask survived an encounter with his former commanding [[officer]], the Empire was ultimately defeated and compelled to [[Imperial Instruments of Surrender|capitulate]] to the Republic, ending the war as well as the [[Imperial Era|reign]] of the Empire.

In the [[Standard year|years]] that followed the [[Galactic Concordance|conclusion]] of the [[The galaxy|Galactic]] Civil War, Hask went on to become an [[First Order officer|officer]] of the [[First Order]], a [[First Order military|military]] junta founded in the [[Unknown Regions]] by a group of Imperials who rejected the war's outcome and the subsequent [[New Republic Era|rise]] of the New Republic. In addition to serving as commander of the [[Resurgent-class Star Destroyer|''Resurgent''-class Star Destroyer]] ''[[Retribution]]'' by [[34 ABY]], he was also a participant in [[Project Resurrection]]&mdash;a clandestine operation which aimed to conscript [[Youngling|children]] for the purpose of training them to become [[Stormtrooper (First Order)|stormtroopers]]. In the same year, the Republic [[capital]] world of [[Hosnian Prime]] was [[Hosnian Cataclysm|destroyed]] by the First Order's [[Starkiller Base|Starkiller]] [[superweapon]], although Hask was killed shortly afterward during a final [[Skirmish on the Retribution|confrontation]] between himself and Iden Versio.

==Biography==
===In the Empire===
A [[Homeworld|native]] of the [[planet]] [[Kuat]], Hask studied at the [[Royal Imperial Academy|Coruscant Imperial University]] where he graduated at the top of his class. Sometime after leaving the [[Imperial Academy]], Hask served aboard the ''[[Mandate]]'' and earned the [[Crimson Star]] for exceptional performances against his enemies along with a promotion. After the [[Battle of Yavin]], Hask, along with [[Senior Lieutenant]] [[Iden Versio]], [[Del Meeko]] and [[Seyn Marana]], was drafted into [[Inferno Squad]], a [[Imperial Special Forces|Special Forces]] unit in the [[Imperial Military]], by [[Admiral]] [[Garrick Versio]]. Hask participated in Inferno's first [[Infiltration of the Dreamers|mission]]: to infiltrate and destroy the [[Dreamers]], which was a success, though it also brought the [[death]] of Marana.<ref name="Inferno Squad" />

Hask went on to participate with Inferno in conducting special operations throughout the [[Galactic Civil War]], and, in [[4 ABY]], fought at the [[Battle of Endor]], which saw the death of [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] and the destruction of the [[Death Star II|second Death Star]]. Hask flew alongside Iden at the [[Battle of Fondor (Galactic Civil War)|battle]] of [[Fondor]], fighting against a [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel]] attack on [[Moff]] [[Raythe]], whose [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|Star Destroyer]] transported [[satellite]]s to be used as part of [[Operation: Cinder]]. However, when this [[climate disruption array]] attacked the [[Versio family|Versio]] homeworld of [[Vardos]], Iden and Meeko both went rogue, though Hask remained loyal to the Empire, succeeding in their original mission to extract [[Protectorate (title)|Protectorate]] [[Gleb]] to Admiral Versio, who promoted Hask to [[Commander]].<ref name="Battlefront II" />

While Iden and Meeko reformed [[Inferno Squad (New Republic)|Inferno Squad]] in the [[New Republic]], Hask continued to serve Admiral Versio and the shattering Empire in the last year of the Galactic Civil War. He oversaw fueling operations on [[Chinook Station]] at [[Bespin]] and evaded capture when Iden and Meeko undertook a [[Mission to Chinook Station|mission]] to the station. Hask went on to fight at the [[Battle of Jakku]], where he took to the skies in a [[TIE/IN interceptor|TIE interceptor]] and engaged in a dogfight with Iden. Iden shot him down, however, seemingly killing him.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

The Empire went on to lose the battle and was forced to [[Imperial Instruments of Surrender|surrender]] to the Republic and sign the [[Galactic Concordance]]. Secretly, however, a select group of [[Imperial officer]]s and loyalists were able to flee into the [[Unknown Regions]] of [[the galaxy]], Hask among them, as part of the secret [[Contingency]]. There, they formed the [[First Order]], and Hask became an [[First Order officer|officer]] within the new faction.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

===In the First Order===
Thirty years after the Battle of Jakku, Meeko and the ''[[Corvus]]'' were captured by [[Jinata Security]], which was in league with the First Order. Hask [[Mission to Pillio (First Order)|confronted]] his former squad mate one last time before killing him personally. He ordered Protectorate Gleb to bury the bodies of Meeko and his crew, but to leave the ''Corvus'' alone, hoping to lure Iden into a trap and kill her as well.

Sometime later, Resistance member and friend of Iden, [[Shriv Suurgav]], found the ''Corvus'' empty, concerned by this he contacted Iden. After they seemingly found out Del was on Vardos being held by Gleb they returned there to find him and Gleb, but when they arrived, they found Gleb had been executed by Hask and the First Order. Hask later revealed to them that he killed Meeko in revenge for when he and Iden defected thirty years prior. He then ordered the Corvus destroyed in an attempt to kill Iden and Del's daughter, [[Zay]], but Zay had survived in an escape pod. He then ordered to have Vardos burned and have Iden and Shriv interrogated for information on the [[Resistance]] and then executed but a battle erupted between J-Sec and First Order forces.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

Hask returned to the ''[[Retribution]]'' but Iden, Zay, and Shriv had followed him in stolen Tie Fighters. They boarded the ship just as it entered hyperspace and went to destroy the hyperdrive with charges. Predicting this, Hask snuck up on them and held Zay at gunpoint just as she had armed the last charge and began taunting Iden to shoot him, but she dropped her weapon as she didn't want to risk hitting Zay. Disappointed in her cowardice he berated her and aimed his pistol at her to kill her but Zay broke free of Hask's grip and tossed a blaster to Iden where he was shot and fell off the catwalk and down into the bottomless pit of the hyperdrive core, killing him.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

==Personality and traits==
Unlike the rest of his comrades in Inferno Squad, because of the tragic events that happened to his family when he was still but a small boy, Gideon Hask was completely devoted to the Galactic Empire and later the First Order, thinking the Rebels as traitors to the Empire and never once questioning the intentions of both factions. Following Iden and Del's "betrayal" and defection to the Rebellion, he did not hesitate to hunt and kill either of them. When he discovered Del three decades later, he had been disillusioned by Del and his wife's weakness after the Galactic Civil War and was willing to make sure that they both pay the price for betraying the Empire at all cost.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

==Behind the scenes==
Gideon Hask was portrayed by [[Paul Blackthorne]] in ''[[Star Wars Battlefront II]]''.<ref name="Battlefront II" />
