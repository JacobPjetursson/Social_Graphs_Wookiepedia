{{Quote|I was one of the lucky Alderaanians mentored directly by your mother. She taught me much about the heritage of Alderaan. What she never taught me&mdash;what she, rather, earned&mdash;was my lifelong respect for the throne.|[[Evaan Verlaine]], to [[Leia Organa]]|Princess Leia, Part I}}
'''Breha Organa''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|female]] who served as [[Alderaanian monarchy|Queen]] of the [[planet]] [[Alderaan]] during the [[Clone Wars]] and the early [[Standard day|days]] of the [[Galactic Civil War]]. At the end of the Clone Wars, she and her husband, [[Senator]] [[Bail Organa]], adopted the newborn [[Leia Organa|Leia]]. The girl, the biological daughter of the late Senator [[Padmé Amidala]] of [[Naboo]] and [[Dark side of the Force|fallen]] [[Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker]], became Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan.

Throughout her [[Standard year|years]] as monarch, the [[queen]] personally mentored a select number of young [[Alderaanian]]s to teach them the culture and heritage of their planet. During the reign of the [[Galactic Empire]], Organa's Alderaan was considered by the Empire to be a source of rebellious activity. The planet became an early supporter of the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]]. Organa and her husband were both [[Death|killed]] shortly before the [[Battle of Yavin]], when the Empire [[The Disaster|destroyed]] Alderaan with its deep space mobile [[battle station]], the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Quote|I'm a daughter of Alderaan. My mother raised me to cherish peace, as I am trying to raise you.|Breha Organa, to Leia Organa|Leia, Princess of Alderaan}}
A member of [[the galaxy]]'s [[Elder Houses]], the [[Sexes|girl]] who would become Breha Organa [[Homeworld|hailed]] from the [[planet]] of [[Alderaan]],<ref name="Leia" /> a peaceful and influential planet.<ref name="DB Ald">{{Databank|alderaan|Alderaan|archivedate=20170706052637}}</ref> She was related to [[Bail Antilles]], who [[Senator|represented]] their home planet in the [[Galactic Senate|Senate]] of the [[Galactic Republic]].<ref name="SWCT">{{Topps|set=Star Wars: Card Trader|sformat=''Star Wars'': Card Trader|cardname=Bail Organa - Galactic Senate|link=http://starwarscardtrader.wikia.com/wiki/Bail_Organa_-_Galactic_Senate}}</ref> As a [[Youngling|child]], she grew up in the [[Royal Palace of Alderaan|Royal Palace]]<ref name="Eclipse">{{Shortstory|story=Eclipse (short story)|sformatted=Eclipse|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref> of [[Aldera]], the planet's [[capital]] [[city]].<ref name="Leia" /> She was introduced to [[Alderaanian]] pacifist values by [[Breha Organa's mother|her mother]], and was first in line to inherit the mantle of [[Alderaanian monarchy|Queen of Alderaan]].<ref name="Leia" />

At the age of sixteen, she underwent her [[Day of Demand]] ceremony, during which she claimed her right to the throne by naming three challenges she would have to complete to prove herself worthy. While completing her [[Challenge of the Body]], Breha suffered a bad fall, and her injuries nearly [[Death|killed]] her, if not for the quick action by the guards who were observing at a distance. Although she did survive, her [[heart]] and [[lung]]s had to be [[Organ replacement|replaced]] by [[pulmonodes]]. Unlike most people who received such mechanized organ replacements, however, she refused to encase them in new flesh and skin, choosing instead to keep them visible as a reminder that she lived.<ref name="Leia" />

At some point after the accident, Breha ascended to the throne and [[Marriage|married]] [[Bail Organa]],<ref name="Leia" /> a fellow Alderaanian [[noble]] who was a distant kinsman to [[Lord]] [[Mellowyn]] of [[Birren]].<ref name="Bloodline" /> Although she and her spouse wished to have a child, the stress placed on the Queen's body from the incident led the couple to decide to adopt an heir instead of trying to [[Reproduction|conceive]] one.<ref name="Leia" />

===Queen of Alderaan===
{{Quote|My wife and I will take the girl. We've always talked of adopting a baby girl. She will be loved with us.|Bail Organa|Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith}}
By the [[time]] of the [[Clone Wars]], a conflict between the Republic and the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]], Breha Organa ruled as the [[Queen]] of Alderaan.<ref name="Revenge of the Sith" /> She was a relative of Bail Antilles, a former senator of Alderaan in the Galactic Senate,<ref name="SWCT" /> and the wife of his successor, the Senator and [[Viceroy]] Bail Organa.<ref name="Revenge of the Sith" /> She also served as the [[Minister of Education|minister of education]] for her planet.<ref name="Backstories Leia">''[[Princess Leia: Royal Rebel]]''</ref> During Queen Breha's reign, and through her husband's efforts in the Senate, Alderaan advocated ending the war, due to the planet's pacifist beliefs,<ref name="DB Alderaan">{{Databank|alderaan|Alderaan|archivedate=20170706052637}}</ref> and hosted a [[Alderaan Refugee Conference|conference]] to assist [[refugee]]s displaced by the [[Galaxy|galactic]] conflict.<ref name="Assassin">{{TCW|Assassin (episode)|Assassin}}</ref>

[[File:Minister Breha.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Breha Organa served as the Minister of Education]]
When the Clone Wars came to an [[Mission to Mustafar|end]], [[Supreme Chancellor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]]&mdash;secretly the [[Dark Lord of the Sith]], [[Darth]] Sidious, who manipulated the conflict to his own tyranical ends&mdash;abolished the Republic and [[Proclamation of the New Order|transformed]] it into the [[Galactic Empire]], with himself as [[Galactic Emperor|absolute ruler]]. He also issued [[Order 66]], a command to all [[clone trooper]]s to kill their [[Jedi]] leaders, thus destroying the [[Jedi Order]]. During that time, Senator [[Padmé Amidala]] gave birth to [[twin]]s, [[Luke Skywalker|Luke]] and [[Leia Organa|Leia]], before dying. The children's father, [[Jedi Knight]] [[Anakin Skywalker]], had also turned to the [[dark side of the Force]] and become Darth Vader bringing an end to both the Jedi and the Separatists. Knowing that the children would be in danger if the [[Sith]] discovered their existence&mdash;both the Emperor and Vader believed that Amidala died before giving birth&mdash;it was decided that [[Jedi Master]] [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] would take Luke to live with Vader's [[Lars family|family]] on [[Tatooine]]. With the consent of both Kenobi and Master [[Yoda]], Bail decided that he and his wife would adopt Leia and raise her as their daughter; the two had always wanted to adopt a girl.<ref name="Revenge of the Sith" /> The Queen then received a [[Letter from Bail Organa to Breha Organa|letter]] from her husband, informing her of Amidala's passing and the imminent arrival of something that would "change [their] lives forever in a profound way."<ref name="Backstories">''[[Princess Leia: Royal Rebel]]''</ref> When the Viceroy finally came back to the palace, he placed baby Leia in the arms of the Queen, who gazed lovingly at her new daughter.<ref name="Revenge of the Sith" />

In the [[Standard year|years]] that followed the Emperor's rise to power, the Queen personally mentored a select number of young Alderaanians, teaching them about the heritage of their homeworld. One of her pupils in particular, a girl named [[Evaan Verlaine]], was so thankful for that privilege that she developed a staunch, lifelong loyalty to the [[House of Organa]] and became a committed royalist.<ref name="SW PL1" /> Breha's husband, while still part of the ceremonial [[Imperial Senate]],<ref name="Rebels Visual Guide">''[[Star Wars Rebels: The Visual Guide]]''</ref> became involved in an underground rebel network,<ref name="Fire Across the Galaxy">{{Rebels|Fire Across the Galaxy}}</ref> which ultimately evolved into a formal [[Alliance to Restore the Republic]].<ref name="EncyclopediaBA">{{SWE|characters|bailorgana|Bail Organa}}</ref>

Alderaan was among the earliest supporters of the Alliance, although its officials cautiously avoided supporting it openly.<ref name="DB Alderaan" /> The Queen and her husband became close friends with [[Jan Dodonna]], a [[General]] in the Alliance.<ref name="SW PL1" /> In time, [[Prince]]ss Leia replaced her father in the Senate and joined the Alliance.<ref name="ANH">[[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']]</ref> At some point, the Queen passed down her [[necklace]], the [[chalcedony waves]], to the princess.<ref name="Leia 4">''[[Princess Leia, Part IV]]''</ref>

In [[9 BBY]], the Queen officiated a ceremony at Aldera during which [[Miara Larte]] of the [[Alderaanian consular security]] was promoted to the [[Military rank|rank]] of [[captain]] at the request of the viceroy. On that day, several other promotions were handed out as well.<ref name="By Whatever Sun">{{Shortstory|story=By Whatever Sun|book=From a Certain Point of View}}</ref>

===Death and legacy===
{{Quote|Let us take a moment to honor the lost souls of Alderaan. To honor Viceroy Bail Organa and Queen Breha Organa. May they forever be remembered.|Leia Organa|Princess Leia, Part I}}
Shortly before the [[Battle of Yavin]], Vader&mdash;who did not know Leia was his daughter&mdash;[[Secret mission to Tatooine|captured]] the princess, who had been part of the [[Battle of Scarif|theft]] of the [[Death Star plans|plans]] to the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]], the Empire's planet-killing deep space mobile [[battle station]]. Leia was captured and brought aboard the Death Star, where she was interrogated for information about the location of the Rebel base&mdash;the [[Great Temple (Yavin 4)|Great Temple]] on [[Yavin 4]]. Because she refused to provide the location, [[Grand Moff]] [[Wilhuff Tarkin]], the station's commander and [[Governor]] of the [[Outer Rim Territories]], threatened to destroy Alderaan if she did not comply. The princess provided a [[Dantooine|false location]] and, though Tarkin trusted her, the Grand [[Moff]] nonetheless chose to target Alderaan;<ref name="ANH" /> the Empire considered it to be a haven for rebellious activity,<ref name="The Rebellion Begins">''[[The Rebellion Begins]]''</ref> and Tarkin believed destroying it would be an effective demonstration of the [[Space station|station's]] power. The planet was [[The Disaster|destroyed]] upon being hit by the Death Star's [[superlaser]], killing all who resided upon it&mdash;<ref name="ANH" />including Queen Breha and her husband.<ref name="SW PL1" /> Breha had worried about Leia while she was on her mission, and as Bail was away, she could not talk to anyone else, due to security concerns. She was supposed to be planning for the upcoming [[equinox]] festivities, but had no enthusiasm for it. Bail's return home from Yavin 4 only amplified Breha's worry, as the Viceroy had learned that the ''[[Tantive IV]]'', Leia's ship, had been captured and destroyed. The Queen knew nothing of her daughter's fate, and was intensely worried. Breha and Bail saw the Death Star eclipse [[Alderaan's sun]], and the Viceroy, horrified, realized what was about to happen and told his wife. They died together, both hoping that Leia was still alive and safe.<ref name="Eclipse" />

[[File:Breha_and_Bail_statues.png|thumb|right|200px|Evaan pays her respects to the late Organas in front of their statues.]]
After the planet's destruction, which Alderaanians who were off-world took to calling "the Disaster,"<ref name="One Thousand Levels Down">{{InsiderCite|151|One Thousand Levels Down}}</ref> the Rebel Alliance managed to destroy the Death Star during the Battle of Yavin.<ref name="ANH" /> Statues of the Queen and the Viceroy were raised in the Rebel base on Yavin 4 as a tribute to the royal couple. During a [[Royal Award Ceremony|ceremony]] commemorating the Rebellion's victory, Leia asked that the Rebels in attendance honor those who died on Alderaan, including her adoptive [[parent]]s. Evaan, likewise, paid her respects to the royals in front of the statues. As Leia coped with her loss in a way that made her seem indifferent, Evaan resented the princess for not [[mourning]] her parents properly. Evaan nonetheless pledged her loyalty to the princess, and the two left Yavin 4 on a [[Mission to rescue the survivors of Alderaan|mission]] to save living Alderaanians from the wrath of the Empire.<ref name="SW PL1" /> Eventually, Breha's chalcedony waves were bestowed upon the [[Sullustan]] [[Nien Nunb]], as a reward for his help evacuating Alderaanians from [[Sullust]].<ref name="Leia 4" />

Eventually, a [[Breha Organa Collection|collection]] of documents pertaining to Queen Breha were stored in the archives of the [[Alderaan Memorial]] on [[Coruscant]], including the letter in which she learned of little Leia's pending arrival. Breha was also prominently featured in a [[Leia Organa's biography|biography]] of Leia Organa written during the [[Cold war|conflict]] between the [[Resistance]] and the [[First Order]].<ref name="Backstories" />

==Personality and traits==
Breha Organa was a [[human]] female with tan-skin, [[Color|black]]-[[hair]], and brown [[eye]]s. Shortly after the end of the Clone Wars, she wore a blue metallic gown with slit sleeves and a collar adorned with a [[gold]] buckle-like brooch. When she wore that gown, the Queen braided a golden fabric into her hair, wrapped it around her head, and put on a semi-transparent blue shawl.<ref name="Revenge of the Sith" /> She attached a great importance to education, taking time to teach several pupils in-person, in addition to her royal duties.<ref name="SW PL1" />

==Skills and abilities==
Unbeknownst to most people, including her daughter, Breha Organa mastered several forms of [[Hand-to-hand combat|hand-to-hand]] fighting, and she mentored a group of selected pupils in combat.<ref name="Backstories Leia" />

==Behind the scenes==
===Character origins===
{{Quote|I thought that Queen Organa might look almost exacly like Padmé, because Leia remembers seeing her mother smile.|Iain McCaig|The Art of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith}}
[[File:Leonore_Organa.png|left|thumb|150px|Concept art of Queen Organa by Iain McCaig, in the likeness of his wife]]
"Queen Breha" first appeared in [[George Lucas]]'s [[1974]] [[The Star Wars: Rough Draft|rough draft]] of what would become [[Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope|''Star Wars'': Episode IV ''A New Hope'']], where she was the wife of [[King]] [[Kayos]] of [[Aquilae]], and the mother of a spoiled, fourteen-year-old Princess Leia.<ref>{{DB|character|leiaorganasolo|Leia Organa Solo}}</ref><ref>''[[The Making of Star Wars: The Definitive Story Behind the Original Film]]''</ref> In this 132-page early story treatment, Breha was described as "a warm, silver-haired matron."<ref name="roughdraft">{{Cite_web|url=http://starwarz.com/starkiller/the-star-wars-rough-draft/|title=THE STAR WARS by George Lucas - Rough Draft|work=Starkiller - The Jedi Bendu Script Site|accessdate=2013-02-01}}</ref> Leia's mother was absent from the final version of the story,<ref name="ANH" /> which was released on the silver screen on [[May 25]], [[1977]].<ref>{{SWArchive|url=community/event/celebration/news20070510d.html|text=May 25th Declared ''Star Wars'' Day in Los Angeles}}</ref> However, in [[2013]], George Lucas's rough draft was adapted into a [[Canon|non-canon]] comic book series called ''[[The Star Wars]]''. That series featured the character [[Breha (The Star Wars)|Breha of Aquilae]], drawn by [[Mike Mayhew]]<ref name="TSW1">''[[The Star Wars 1]]''</ref> in a style that resembles a [[:File:Scary Lira.png|concept drawing]] of Princess Leia in [[Cloud City]], originally made by [[Ralph McQuarrie]] for [[Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back|''Star Wars'': Episode V ''The Empire Strikes Back'']].<ref>''[[The Art of Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back]]''</ref>

George Lucas resurrected the character early in the production of [[Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith|''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'']], the third installment of the ''Star Wars'' [[prequel trilogy]]. In [[December]] [[2002]], he informed his production staff that Princess Leia's surrogate mother would appear in the movie. Lucas described her as a trustworthy, peaceful woman in her mid-thirties, and illustrator [[Iain McCaig]] drew several conceptual artworks based on that description. In one of his drawings, McGaig gave Breha the traits of Padmé Amidala, in an attempt to explain how Leia could remember seeing the smile of her mother. In another piece of concept art, McCaig sought to recreate the likeness of his wife Leonor.<ref name="AoSW3">''[[The Art of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]''</ref>

===Portrayal===
{{Quote|As a girl growing up and seeing ''Star Wars'', of course you want to be Princess Leia. And to know that I'm actually playing her mother&hellip; I just kept thinking about those buns! I was the mother of those buns! Maybe I taught her how to do those buns!|Rebecca Jackson Mendoza, on playing Breha Organa|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20100328022639/http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/bts/production/beacon161.html}}
[[File:MendozaBTS.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Rebecca Jackson Mendoza during a fitting seance with Trisha Biggar]]
In May [[2005]], Breha Organa made her on-screen debut in ''Star Wars'': Episode III ''Revenge of the Sith'', in which she was portrayed by [[Wikipedia:Australia|Australian]] actress and singer [[Rebecca Jackson Mendoza]].<ref name="Revenge of the Sith" /> Despite being a fan of the [[original trilogy]], Jackson Mendoza did not immediately realize the significance of her role in the ''Star Wars'' franchise. When her brothers helped her understand that the Queen was none other than the adopted mother of Princess Leia, her excitement over the role increased. Rebecca Jackson Mendoza remembered having watched the original trilogy as a child, wishing she could be Princess Leia. In light of all that, Jackson Mendoza came to regard that role as something of an accomplishment.<ref name="Beacon">{{SWArchive|url=episode-iii/bts/production/beacon161.html|text=Homing Beacon #161 - ''Revenge''{{'s}} Royalty}}</ref>

A single robe, referred to as the "Alderaan Palace Dress" in ''[[Dressing a Galaxy: The Costumes of Star Wars]]'',<ref name="DAG">''[[Dressing a Galaxy: The Costumes of Star Wars]]''</ref> was created for Jackson Mendoza by [[Trisha Biggar]], who worked as costume designer for all three prequel films. That robe, which Jackson Mendoza compared to a "green wedding gown," was originally going to be made of velvet, until the fabric was changed for fear it would come off too dark on screen.<ref name="Beacon" />

===Development===
Queen Breha received her first significant character development in [[Claudia Gray]]'s [[2017]] young-adult novel ''[[Leia, Princess of Alderaan]]''. Gray said it actually staggered her to realize how little had been written about Breha, who had such a central position in the narrative of ''Star Wars'', being Leia's adopted mother, and a queen at the core of the Rebellion. Therefore, she was keen on giving her a role and a personality.<ref name="SWExplained">{{Youtube|video=MEUVCWcczCw|text=Claudia Gray Discusses Writing Leia At Different Ages and Writing Breha Organa for the First Time!|channel=channel/UCIKlsX1qfGqKPt4KAW-JOZg|channelname=Star Wars Explained|quote=}}</ref>
