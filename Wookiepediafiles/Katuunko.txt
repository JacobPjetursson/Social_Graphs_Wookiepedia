'''Katuunko''' was the [[King]] of the [[planet]] [[Toydaria]] and the [[Toydarian]] [[species]] during the [[Clone Wars]]. With honesty and his people's safety as his greatest concerns, he initially kept his [[homeworld]] neutral in the conflict, but after agreeing to aid the suffering [[Twi'lek]]s of the planet [[Ryloth]] when asked by the [[Galactic Republic]] he decided it was [[time]] to make a choice.

Katuunko arranged for a secret meeting between the [[Toydarian Royal Delegation]] and [[Jedi]] [[Grand Master]] [[Yoda]] on the neutral [[moon]] of [[Rugosa]], but the arrangement was discovered by the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] and [[Sith apprentice]] [[Asajj Ventress]] was sent to disrupt it. Yoda successfully defeated Ventress's forces and earned the Toydarian allegiance, after which Katuunko began representing the Toydarians in the [[Galactic Senate]].

[[Count]] [[Dooku]] eventually arranged for Ventress's replacement, [[Savage Opress]], to capture Katuunko alive but the apprentice [[Death|killed]] the King instead by force choking him, and throwing his corpse to the ground in the [[Toydarian]] Throne Room. When Dooku found out about this, he became infuriated with Savage.
