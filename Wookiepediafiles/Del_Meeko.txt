{{Quote|Del Meeko. You worked your way up through the ranks, first as a stormtrooper, then a shoretrooper, then a TIE pilot. You have received several commendations for courage under fire. Your commanders have made notations that you excel at whatever you turn your hand to, but you seem to be parÂ­ticularly gifted with repairing everything&mdash;from armor to droids to engines.|[[Admiral]] [[Garrick Versio]]|Battlefront II: Inferno Squad}}
'''Del Meeko''' was a [[human]] [[Sexes|male]] [[Coruscanti|native]] of [[Coruscant]], the [[capital]] [[Planet|world]] of the [[Galactic Empire]] during the [[Imperial Era]]. During the reign of [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Sheev Palpatine]], Meeko served in the [[Imperial Military]] as a [[stormtrooper]], a [[Coastal defender stormtrooper|shoretrooper]], and a [[TIE fighter pilot]] in turn. Following the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance's]] [[Battle of Scarif|theft]] of the [[Death Star plans|plans]] to the [[DS-1 Orbital Battle Station|Death Star]] in the [[Standard year|year]] [[0 BBY]], Meeko became an [[agent]] of [[Inferno Squad]], a [[special forces]] [[Squad|unit]] led by [[Captain]] [[Iden Versio]].

The Emperor's [[death]] in [[4 ABY]] resulted in the activation of [[Operation: Cinder]]; as part of the overall [[Contingency]], its purpose was to ensure the annihilation of both the Empire and its enemies. Inferno Squad was dispatched to [[Fondor]] with orders to retrieve [[satellite]]s that were [[Climate disruption array|critical]] to the execution of Operation: Cinder. After completing their [[Battle of Fondor (Galactic Civil War)|objective]], Meeko was ordered to destroy the [[Emperor's Observatory]] on [[Pillio]]. In the course of his [[Mission to Pillio|mission]], he encountered the [[Jedi Knight]] [[Luke Skywalker]]. Despite their different allegiances, Meeko and Skywalker worked together by fighting off many [[scritter]]s&mdash;indigenous [[Species|lifeforms]] that were hostile to the offworlders&mdash;in order to reach the [[observatory]].

After parting ways with Skywalker, Meeko rejoined Inferno Squad at [[Vardos]] where the team learned that Versio's [[homeworld]] was one of the targets under Operation: Cinder. Unwilling to participate in the ruin of a planet noted for its loyalty to the Empire, Meeko and Versio [[Skirmish on Vardos|rebelled]] against the military in an effort to save civilians. Having severed their ties with the Empire, they surrendered to the Alliance, but were given a chance to fight alongside the Rebels at the [[Battle of Naboo (Galactic Civil War)|Battle of Naboo]]. By saving [[Naboo]], another planet targeted by Operation: Cinder, Meeko and Versio were both welcomed into the ranks of the newly-formed [[New Republic]] by [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Organa]].

In [[5 ABY]], approximately one year after the [[Battle of Endor]], the [[Inferno Squad (New Republic)|new Inferno Squad]] was among the [[New Republic military|Republic forces]] that defeated the [[Jakku Imperial remnant|Imperial forces]] led by [[Counselor to the Empire|Counselor]] [[Gallius Rax]] at the [[Battle of Jakku]]. In the years that [[New Republic Era|followed]] the Empire's [[Imperial Instruments of Surrender|defeat]] and the [[Galactic Concordance|conclusion]] of the [[Galactic Civil War]], Meeko and Versio raised a daughter named [[Zay]]. By [[34 ABY]], roughly three [[Standard decade|decades]] after the war, Meeko was [[Mission to Pillio (First Order)|captured]] by the [[First Order]] and [[Torture|interrogated]] by [[Kylo Ren]], a [[Dark side of the Force|dark side]] [[Knights of Ren|warrior]] tasked with hunting the last [[Jedi]]. With no further use for Meeko, Ren turned the veteran [[soldier]] over to [[Commander]] [[Gideon Hask]]&mdash;a [[First Order officer]] who once served with Meeko as an agent of Inferno Squad&mdash;who personally executed his former comrade.

==Biography==
===Early life===
A [[Homeworld|native]] of [[Coruscant]], Del Meeko grew up during the [[time]] of the [[Jedi Order]],<ref name="BTS" /> although the stories he heard about the [[Jedi]] caused him to fear them.<ref name="Battlefront II" /> Meeko worked his way through the ranks of the [[Imperial Military]], starting as a [[stormtrooper]], then as a [[Coastal defender stormtrooper|shoretrooper]] on [[Scarif]] then as a [[TIE fighter pilot]] and finally a [[chief engineer]] aboard a [[Implacable|Star Destroyer]].<ref name="Inferno Squad" />

===Joining Inferno Squad===
Sometime after the [[Battle of Yavin]], Meeko, along with [[Senior Lieutenant]] [[Iden Versio]], [[Gideon Hask]] and [[Seyn Marana]], was drafted into [[Inferno Squad]], a [[Imperial Special Forces|Special Forces]] unit in the Imperial Military, by [[Admiral]] [[Garrick Versio]]. Meeko participated in Inferno's first [[Infiltration of the Dreamers|mission]]: to infiltrate and destroy the [[Dreamers]], which was successful, though Marana [[Death|died]].<ref name="Inferno Squad" />

Meeko continued serving as an elite [[agent]] in Inferno Squad, conducting special operations for the Empire throughout the [[Galactic Civil War]] against the [[Alliance to Restore the Republic|Rebel Alliance]]. He fought at the [[Battle of Endor]] in [[4 ABY]], which saw the death of [[Galactic Emperor|Emperor]] [[Darth Sidious|Palpatine]] and destruction of the [[Death Star II|second Death Star]]. Meeko held the ''[[Corvus]]'' during the [[Battle of Fondor (Galactic Civil War)|battle]] of [[Fondor]], where Inferno fought against a Rebel attack on [[Moff]] [[Raythe]]'s [[Imperial-class Star Destroyer|Star Destroyer]] ''[[Dauntless]]'', which was transporting [[satellite]]s to be used as part of [[Operation: Cinder]].

====Mission to Pillio====

Meeko later took part in the [[Mission to Pillio|mission]] to [[Pillio]] as the sole Inferno agent with orders to destroy the [[Emperor's Observatory]]. Despite being on opposite sides of the war and once fearing the Jedi, Meeko agreed to a temporary truce with new age [[Jedi Knight]] [[Luke Skywalker]] to find the [[Observatory]] while fighting off Pillio's native bugs, ultimately allowing the Jedi to keep a special compass from the facility.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

===Defecting to the Rebel Alliance===
[[File:Iden Del Shriv and Leia on Naboo.png|thumb|right|250px|Del, Iden and Shriv meeting with Leia Organa.]]
When the [[climate disruption array]]s from the ''Dauntless'' targeted the [[Versio family|Versio]] homeworld of [[Vardos]], Meeko remained loyal to Iden as both went rogue, helping a group of civilians and their crew escape aboard the ''Corvus'', narrowly evading the ''[[Eviscerator]]'' and Admiral Versio. They decided to surrender to the Rebel Alliance, and provided key intelligence on Operation: Cinder to [[Danger Leader]] [[Shriv Suurgav]] and [[General]] [[Lando Calrissian]]. Meeko and Iden both fought at the [[Battle of Naboo (Galactic Civil War)|battle of Naboo]] in an effort to combat Operation: Cinder, and ultimately defected to the [[New Republic]] as [[Prince]]ss [[Leia Organa]] welcomed them in.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

===Serving the New Republic===
[[File:Iden and Del kiss.png|thumb|left|250px|Del Meeko and Iden Versio kiss following the [[Battle of Jakku]].]]
Meeko continued to serve in [[Inferno Squad (New Republic)|Inferno Squad]] as it was integrated into the New Republic under the command of Iden Versio, making attempts to capture Hask and Admiral Versio as they fought against the Imperial remnants in the final year of the Galactic Civil War. Meeko piloted the ''Corvus'' at the [[Battle of Jakku]] while Iden shot down Hask and attempted to rescue her father from the crashing ''Eviscerator''. Iden narrowly escaped aboard an [[escape pod]], and reunited with Meeko at the end of the battle, which saw a victory for the Republic and the final defeat of the Empire.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

===Later years===
[[File:GideonFO.png|thumb|right|250px|Del Meeko's final moments.]]
Del and Iden went on to marry and have a [[Zay|daughter]]. Del used the ''Corvus'' to haul cargo in his newfound life of peace, and found faith in [[the Force]]. However, about thirty years after the Battle of Jakku, Del and his crew were captured by [[Protectorate (title)|Protectorate]] [[Gleb]] and [[Jinata Security]] on Pillio, where he was [[Mission to Pillio (First Order)|interrogated]] by [[Kylo Ren]] for information on where [[Lor San Tekka]] took the [[map to Skywalker]]. Afterwards, he was confronted by a living Hask, now an [[First Order officer|officer]] in the [[First Order]]. In his final words, he addressed Hask by his first name and implored him not to go after Iden, warning Hask it would not end well for him before being shot four times to death by his former squad mate. Hask then ordered Gleb to bury the corpses of Meeko and his crew in order to leave the ''Corvus'' alone with the intention of luring Iden into a trap.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

==Personality and traits==
Despite his Imperial background and loyalty to Inferno Squad, Del Meeko was deeply conflicted, and often uncertain about the Empire's methods. Growing up on Coruscant, he heard only frightening stories about the Jedi until being saved by Luke Skywalker, who encouraged him to follow his own path.<ref name="Battlefront II" />

==Behind the scenes==
Del Meeko was portrayed by [[TJ Ramini]] in the [[2017]] video game ''[[Star Wars Battlefront II]]''.<ref name="Battlefront II" />
